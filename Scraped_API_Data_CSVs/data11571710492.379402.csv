Bernie Sanders was third with 11%, followed closely by Pete Buttigieg at 9%. Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with 6% support. (Of the top five candidates, Warren was the only candidate to see her support grow since June.)

* On a related note, it’s worth noting that in the same Iowa poll, local Democrats were asked for their first and second choices, which matter a great deal given the way the state’s caucus system is structured. When first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Warren’s advantage over Biden is even more striking: 42% to 30%. Sanders is further back at 21%, followed by Buttigieg’s 18%.

* Staff shake-ups on Bernie Sanders’ team continue, with the Vermont senator parting ways with one of his Iowa deputy field directors. Kevin Lata had previously worked on Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, as well as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 team.

* In keeping with the recent trend, the Alaska Republican Party became the latest state GOP to officially cancel its Republican presidential primary, which had been scheduled for April. Several state parties have taken similar steps to protect Donald Trump from possible embarrassment against his primary rivals.

* As the General Motors strike continues, several Democratic presidential candidates have visited picket lines to show support for members of the United Auto Workers.

* With some evidence of Texas becoming more competitive, Republican officials are making it easier for Green Party candidates to qualify for the ballot, with the obvious hope that the move will undermine Democratic support.

* Though it’s difficult to know if this is a stunt, Cory Booker’s campaign manager wrote in a new memo to staff and supporters that the New Jersey senator’s presidential campaign may come to an end without another $1.7 million before the end of the quarter. (The third quarter ends a week from today.)

* As expected, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D) officially kicked off a primary campaign in Massachusetts against incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D) over the weekend.

* And following their recent Twitter argument over which one of them is more closely aligned with Trump’s foreign policy, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is reportedly taking steps to undermine Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) prospective U.S. Senate campaign."

WARREN SURGES IN IOWA

Des Moines Register: “Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.”



Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary Juliàn Castro’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.”



Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems - NBC News: “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President Donald Trump, the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)”



The end may be near for Booker - Politico: “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.”

TIME OUT: MEET YOU IN ST. LOUIS

History: “Amid much public excitement, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark return to St. Louis, Missouri, from the first recorded overland journey from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. The Lewis and Clark Expedition had set off more than two years before to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase. Even before the U.S. government concluded purchase negotiations with France, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his private secretary Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, an army captain, to lead an expedition into what is now the U.S. Northwest. On May 14, the ‘Corps of Discovery,’ featuring some two dozen men, left St. Louis for the American interior. … On September 23, 1806, after two and a half years, the expedition returned to the city, bringing back a wealth of information about the largely unexplored region, as well as valuable U.S. claims to Oregon Territory.”

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL

NYT: “President Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.”



Trump continues to defend his call about Biden - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.”



Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint - Politico: “Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’”



Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden - Fox News: “Rudy Giuliani channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden, suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’”



CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK

Roll Call: “The Senate needs to act this week to clear a stopgap spending bill before recessing through the end of the government’s fiscal year, but that is really the only must-pass business for either chamber. The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.”

UPI: “A raccoon went for a 16-mile ride on top of a Florida bread delivery truck that reached speeds of over 50 mph during the trip. The driver of the Wonder Bread truck said other drivers called his attention to the raccoon on top of his truck, and he had already traveled about 10 miles before calling 911 from the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Police and the driver attempted to get the raccoon to safety by pulling the truck up to a convenient tree branch, but the animal refused to climb down. The driver said he eventually had to drive the final 6 miles of his journey with the raccoon still riding on the roof. He said the animal eventually apparently climbed down on its own once the truck was parked at his company's headquarters in North Fort Myers.”

The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren as the first choice for 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was first choice of 20 percent of the voters.

In June, the Register poll showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders.

While Biden continues to lead in national polls some are concerned about his current standing.

Co-host Jesse Watters pointed out Biden may lose multiple early primaries before he reaches states he polls strongest in.

""I've seen three polls where he's losing to either Warren or Sanders in New Hampshire,"" Watters said.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., surged ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden in a new poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers released late Saturday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg slipping into a distant third and fourth, respectively.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. By comparison, the Register poll in June showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders.

J. Ann Selzer, president of pollster Selzer & Co., told the Register the survey represented ""the first major shakeup” of the Iowa race, because: ""It’s the first time we’ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.""

BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM'

Sanders was in third place with 11 percent support, a five percentage-point drop from the Register's June poll. No other candidate cracked 10 percent of the first-choice vote, with Buttigieg garnering nine percent. That also represents a five percentage-point drop from June.

Warren also had the highest percentage of poll respondents (20 percent) who said she was their second choice in the February caucus. By contrast, Biden and Sanders each garnered 10 percent of the second-choice vote. Warren also had the highest favorability rating of any candidate, with 75 percent of respondents saying they had a very or mostly favorable view of her compared to 66 percent for Biden and 58 percent for Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., rounded out the top five, with six percent of voters saying she was their first choice. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Cory Booker, D-NJ, both received three percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer each received three percent.

The polling shakeup may not be done, as 63 percent of respondents said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. Harris, Buttigieg and Booker could still benefit from late deciders, as 39 percent, 37 percent and 35 percent of poll respondents said they were still actively considering those respective candidates.

The poll came from a sample size of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 14-18.

The most recent Fox News poll of Democratic primary voters nationwide showed Biden with 29 percent support, down six percentage points from his peak in May.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has apparently reached a boiling point over moderate House Democrats’ caution regarding the prospect of impeaching President Trump.

The go-slow approach is personified by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with whom Ocasio-Cortez has had an often contentious relationship since the freshman lawmaker arrived in Washington just eight months ago.

The New York Democrat told her more than 5 million Twitter followers late Saturday that the Democrats’ “refusal” to seek the removal of the president was a “bigger national scandal” than what she alleged was the president’s “lawbreaking behavior.”

JUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT

Calls for impeachment have grown louder from some Democrats in the wake of last week’s news that a purported “whistleblower” had expressed concern about a phone call said to have taken place between President Trump and the leader of Ukraine, in which Trump allegedly sought information about 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, whose son Hunter Biden had business dealings in Ukraine.

Soon after Ocasio-Cortez posted her Saturday comment, she received a response from James Fallows, the noted author, journalist and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, who asserted that Ocasio-Cortez was overstating the case in criticizing members of her own party for exercising restraint regarding impeachment.

LEADING HOUSE DEM TELLS PARTY NOT TO BE 'HASTY' IN PURSUING WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATIONS

“IMO, this is ‘false equivalence’ of its own sort,” Fallows wrote. “What Trump is doing remains objectively the biggest threat, scandal, and problem.

“Second-ranking: the silent acquiescence of the GOP Senate.

“Then: it’s time for the House to act.”

Ocasio Cortez doubled down in her response to Fallows.

“It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law,” she wrote. “It’s another to let him.

“The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It’s threatened when we do nothing about it.

“The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is.”

Ocasio-Cortez’s online outburst followed remarks earlier in the day by fellow progressive and 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who took a veiled shot at Pelosi, the standard-bearer among Democrats of a “wait and see” approach regarding potential action against the president.

""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice,” Warren said at an event in Iowa. “I read all 448 pages [of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation] and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump.

“Congress failed to act,” Warren added, “and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system.”

Just over a week ago, Pelosi had lashed out at reporters when they repeatedly asked her about impeachment at a news conference.

“Impeachment is a very divisive measure,” a clearly frustrated Pelosi said, “but if we have to go there, we have to go there and we can't go there unless we have the facts. And we’ll follow the facts and follow the obstruction the president is making ... and make a decision when we’re ready.

“That’s the only question, that’s all I’m going to say about this subject, and there's nothing different from one day to the next,” she added.

The struggles experienced by the 79-year-old Pelosi, a three-decade member of Congress from California, have included frequent clashes with Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and other progressive – and aggressive – young lawmakers who were swept into office during last year’s midterm elections. The progressives’ push for far-left policies, including Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, as well as their vocal opposition to President Trump, have been at odds with the moderates’ typically lower-key approach to getting things done.

Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. The meeting was soon followed by the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.

But with Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter posts that began late Saturday, it appears the truce with Pelosi – at least regarding impeachment – may be over.

Nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters questioned in a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll say they support a government-run single-payer Medicare-for-all style system that would replace existing private insurance. That plan is championed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two progressive standard-bearers in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT MEDICARE BUY-INS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL

But among all voters, support for such a plan plunges to just 41 percent. About 56 percent of registered voters oppose a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance.

The poll, released Sunday, indicates that what two-thirds of all voters do like is allowing a Medicare buy-in for those under 65 years old. That’s in line with the public option being pitched by former Vice President Joe Biden. Currently, the taxpayer-funded program covers Americans 65 and older.

The latest Fox News national poll also points to the popularity of the Medicare buy-in plan, with 83 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they favor the plan, which would allow individuals to buy into the government-run system. Even 51 percent of Republicans agree.

Among all voters, 68 percent support a buy-in system. But support for a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance nosedives to 46 percent among all voters in the Fox News poll, which was released last week. Sen. Kamala Harris of California also supports Medicare-for-all, albeit with a role for private insurers.

Health care has been a leading concern among Democratic primary voters, with the issue topping the past two primary debates.

King, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said there should be a high standard for making conversations involving the executive branch public, and compared the recent media frenzy to the hype surrounding the Russia investigation.

ADAM SCHIFF THREATENS TO DEFUND INTEL COMMUNITY UNLESS TRUMP WHISTLEBLOWER DETAILS DISCLOSED

""Any facts coming out of a conversation between the president of the United States and a foreign leader, to me, it’s very difficult to see circumstances where that should be made public,"" he said.

""If it goes to Congress, it’ll be made public. This went on all during Russia,"" King added. ""It went to the Intelligence Committee -- then it was leaked to the New York Times... and it all turned out to be fake and to be false.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif, had the opposite view and threatened to cut funding to the intel community if the contents of the call were not released. Trump fired back Sunday morning while speaking with reporters on his way to a rally in Houston, and maintained the call was above board.

For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump in July pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment.

But the firestorm, apparently related to a still-secret whistleblower complaint, has, in turn, opened the door for Republicans to revisit the original controversy involving Joe Biden's son Hunter. Further, they allege, the details of that story suggest Biden did the same thing Trump is accused of doing -- leveraging military aid to pressure Ukraine.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

“The more they want to talk about Ukraine, the better,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday morning on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”

Giuliani has long been looking into the Bidens’ ties to Ukraine, claiming Hunter Biden improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioning whether his dad helped protect him.

Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

Trump has claimed Shokin ""was after"" Hunter Biden and the vice president was trying to protect his son.

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether or not he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

Trump allies are hammering that as the real scandal, as video of Biden once bragging about his role in having Shokin fired has gone viral.

BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS

Biden has denied wrongdoing, with Shokin having already been suspected of corruption before his dismissal, and hammered Trump over the reports on his phone conversation with Kiev. For his part, Trump addressed his phone call with Zelensky by calling the conversation “perfect” and insisting “there was no quid pro quo” and that he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Trump also insists that the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine is bogus because he gave the aid.

Trump also tweeted Sunday night, stating that the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Giuliani is also trying to circulate new Biden allegations.

Giuliani accused Kiev on Monday of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden and suggested the Obama administration turned a blind eye.

""If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,” he tweeted. ""Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?""

While the former vice president has claimed he and his son never discussed Hunter’s business, Hunter told The New Yorker that they did talk about it once, with Joe Biden telling his son, ""I hope you know what you are doing.""

Democrats and Republicans are both pushing for investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has shied away from calling for impeachment in the past, told CNN on Sunday that the latest allegations against Trump may warrant such a measure.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,” Schiff said.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint involving Trump to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he wants the Justice Department to look into the Bidens’ dealings with Ukraine.

“Nobody’s looked at this, but somebody should, so I’m hoping the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,” Graham said. “Was there a relationship between the vice president’s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don’t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I sure as hell don’t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.”

All this comes as Democrats continue to battle for the 2020 presidential nomination. After three debates, Biden remains the front-runner, but he has lost ground to rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with Warren surpassing Biden in a new Iowa poll.

Devin Nunes predicted on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Joe Biden's campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of newly resurfaced reports about his possible misconduct in Ukraine that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race.""

The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren surging ahead of Biden as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June.

Nunes, speaking to anchor Maria Bartiromo, said a whistleblower's allegation that President Trump had acted inappropriately during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will ultimately backfire, and shine a light on Biden's own possible misconduct. CNN later acknowledged that the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge of the call, and a top Ukrainian official on Saturday defended Trump's actions.

FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED

""These stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,"" Nunes said. ""So now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme -- maybe this whistleblower really is not a partisan. We want to hear from that whistleblower, but it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero.""

Late Sunday, Trump echoed Nunes' comments, and emphasized that Biden recently bragged about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor when he was vice president. At the time, the prosecutor was probing a company closely linked to Biden's son, Hunter.

""Sleepy Joe Biden ... forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""That's the real story!""

Nunes said the ever-deepening schism in the Democratic Party over whether to impeach the president -- highlighted late Saturday when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called it a major ""scandal"" that Democrats hadn't yet voted to impeach -- would help Trump in 2020.

""The more I think that they’re out there promoting this kind of craziness and silliness, the more that the American people are put off, and the more likely President Trump is reelected,” Nunes added.

There were parallels, Nunes said, with Democrats' ultimately debunked claims that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.

""This has all the hallmarks of the Russia hoax,"" Nunes said. ""Something leaks out. ... and then it's the same reporters that report on it, the same reporters that reported on the Russia hoax. Then you move forward, and what happens? Then supposedly they come and testify -- and the night before they testify, the whistleblower who supposedly doesn't want anybody to know who this person is, or what information they have, well, it's spilled all over the pages of the Washington Post"" the day before Congress was briefed on the matter.

""Whoever came up with this scheme -- it looks like somebody was trying to deflect what Biden did back in 2015,"" Nunes said. ""This scheme seems to have backfired on Biden. I mean, Biden's already dropping in the polls.""

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump had repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe.

At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden openly boasted about successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire that prosecutor when he was vice president.

Unverified reports circulated on left-leaning media outlets claiming that Trump could have even promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved.

Trump acknowledged Sunday that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" However, the president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE

DNI Inspector General Michael Atkinson said in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an “urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress.

“Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,” Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday.

""At that time, we expect him to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower’s full complaint to the Committee,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Sunday afternoon. ""We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law.""

Pelosi also seemingly threatened that she would back impeachment if her demands were not met, in a potentially major shift to her wait-and-see approach thus far: ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine. The president has said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and denied delaying any military aid funding.

The whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired.

“I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

“Well, son of a b-tch, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

And earlier this year, The Hill reported that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats, and that they have been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department.

A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump told Fox News that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed they would be reviewed by the DOJ.

Additionally, attention focused anew on President Obama's hot-mic comment to then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at a nuclear disarmament summit in March 2012, in which Obama was overheard saying he would have more ""flexibility"" to negotiate with Russia after the November 2012 election.

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy.

Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power.""

“Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden told reporters in Iowa.

But Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken “just once” about it.

“And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said. “Of course you spoke to your son!”

Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation.""

Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted.

The September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows that 69 percent of voters dislike Trump. That is a toxic level in any race let alone one for the presidency.

It is impossible to improve that sentiment to less than 50 percent in the remaining 14 months before the 2020 election. Prior to this poll, the highest dislike of a president was 42 percent for George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in March 2006.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: WHAT IS TRUMP-BIDEN CLASH OVER UKRAINE AND WHISTLEBLOWER ALL ABOUT?

In the same poll, 49 percent say they’re very uncomfortable with Trump’s 2020 candidacy. That’s compared with 41 percent for Bernie Sanders and 33 percent apiece for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Furthermore, a record 50 percent dislike Trump and his policies.

Other polls show Trump losing a general election to any of the top five Democratic candidates for president.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why Trump allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the front-runner in the crowded Democratic primary field. That should concern every American.

It has been widely reported that Trump asked the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, eight times in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, while vice president, acted improperly in pressuring the resignation of a Ukraine prosecutor whose office was investigating a company that employed Biden's son. Trump denies these allegations and the Ukrainian foreign minister said Saturday, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.”

It was also reported that Trump threatened to withhold $250 million in military aid from Ukraine if they didn’t cooperate. That money was released this month.

Furthermore, Trump insisted that Ukraine work on the matter with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, not official representatives of the U.S. government.

However, if these reports are true, a request to benefit Trump’s political prospects, rather than United States or its national security, is illegal.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why he allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner.

Trump's acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to discuss the complaint that brought this matter to light when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee last week and refused to provide the whistleblower complaint to Congress … which they are legally entitled to receive.

In addition to allegedly seeking assistance from a foreign government to interfere in our election,Trump has done nothing to secure our election systems.

In June, the House passed the Secure Election Act, which authorized $600 million for states to bolster election systems. The act would require the implementation of cybersecurity safeguards for hardware and software used in elections, bar wireless communication devices in election systems, and require electronic voting machines be manufactured in the United States.

However, the Senate had not taken up the measure because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was refusing to do so. Until last week. Out of the blue, just one day after the Ukraine story broke, McConnell approved $250 million for election security, a token amount that will provide only $5 million per state to fight the Russians and will have little real effect.

It seems McConnell, who takes umbrage with his nickname “Moscow Mitch,"" may have been trying to head off criticism about foreign election interference with this gesture. But it is just that, a gesture. There are 406 days until next year's general election – and only 133 until the 2020 caucuses and primaries begin – and the resources and reforms to guard against foreign interference are not close to what is needed.

It appears Trump is so worried about his poll numbers that he thinks he needs outside help to win and that no one can or will stop him … again.

If that is true, then Trump is acting in a decidedly un-American fashion.

Cruz mocked O'Rourke's shift last week, noting that in 2018 he warned that O'Rourke wanted to ""take our guns,” yet fact-checker PolitiFact rated that claim “false.”

""PolitiFact — you non-partisan sexy thing you — so ... did you buy Beto’s shirt?"" Cruz joked on Twitter.

Texas political activists assert that O’Rourke can't win in Texas anymore with these positions.

“O'Rourke's ‘hell yes’ to gun confiscation demonstrates how little he knows about Texans and rifles,” said JoAnn Fleming, the executive director of Grassroots America, We the People PAC, a conservative group in Texas. “By shooting off his mouth, Beto managed to end his political career in Texas, while driving up rifle sales.”

O’Rourke’s rhetoric on guns has not picked up much support from his former colleagues in Congress. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who is negotiating with Senate Republicans on expanding background checks and possibly creating “red flag” laws, pushed back on the mandatory buyback idea.

""I don't know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O'Rourke,"" Schumer told reporters from upstate New York, according to the Times Union.

But O’Rourke hit back at Schumer in a fundraising email, pointing out that most Democrats nationally agree with him.

“With respect to the minority leader, a recent Monmouth University poll found that nearly 70 percent of Democrats support Beto’s mandatory buyback of assault weapons,” O’Rourke’s fundraising email said.

O'Rourke entered the Democratic race to great fanfare this year, but has struggled in the polls. Some Democrats have suggested he set his sights on a 2020 bid for the Senate, and not the White House.

Even some liberal writers have acknowledged that O’Rourke’s gun policies could hurt him in Texas.

“Beto is no longer a viable candidate for the Senate in Texas, thanks to his gun confiscation comment,” German Lopez, a writer for Vox, wrote on Twitter.

For his part, O’Rourke has been adamant that he no longer wants a Texas Senate seat, despite past pressure from some Texas Democrats and news outlets to drop his long-shot presidential bid and compete for Republican Sen. John Cornyn's seat instead.

“There have even been some who have suggested that I stay in Texas and run for Senate,” O’Rourke said in an August speech. “But that would not be good enough for this community. That would not be good enough for El Paso. That would not be good enough for this country.""

Cornyn joined the pile-on against O’Rourke’s shifting positions last week, highlighting another new O'Rourke proposal on marijuana.

O’ROURKE CALLS FOR LEGALIZING MARIJUANA, RELEASING NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS

“Say it ain’t so, Beto. First, grab guns of law abiding citizens and now legalize marijuana?” Cornyn tweeted.

However, polling indicates that a slight majority of Texans in fact support legalizing some quantity of marijuana. But O’Rourke would go further than legalization, proposing taxing marijuana to fund “justice grants” for people who were convicted for marijuana possession in the past.

O’Rourke has also come out for impeaching President Trump.

“Polls consistently show that an overwhelming majority of Texans do not support the impeachment of President Trump,” Fleming noted.

A Quinnipiac poll found that 60 percent of Texans say Congress should not try to impeach, while only 34 percent support it.

O’Rourke’s leftward shift has not been getting him traction in the polls yet. In polling averages, he gets just about 3 percent nationally.

“His far-left stance will continue to generate attention and secure him a spot on the cable news circuit. But it's not a governing philosophy, nor a winning campaign one,” Texas-based economist and political consultant Abby McCloskey told Fox News.

“The far-left ground in the 2020 presidential campaign is better covered by [Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth] Warren, who clearly has thought through her proposals in detail,” McCloskey added.

Fleming added: “His wild swing to gun confiscation appears to be an admission he won't ever run for office in Texas again.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump amounted to a major ""national scandal,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to relent on Sunday -- and warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching.

Pelosi, who has long resisted calls to impeach Trump because the move would imperil the electability of moderate Democrats in the House, outlined her new stance in a statement Sunday. Pelosi specifically said that a whistleblower who reportedly alleged that Trump acted improperly during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided.

Her aggressive push came as top Republicans, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, predicted that the gambit would backfire for Democrats. Later in the evening, Trump sounded a similar note, saying the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine.""

The whistleblower drama escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that a Ukrainian prosecutor had been investigating as part of a corruption probe. At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden openly bragged about successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire that prosecutor when he was vice president.

CNN later reported the whistleblower had no direct knowledge of the call, and a top Ukrainian official on Saturday defended Trump's actions. Unverified reports circulated on left-leaning media outlets claiming that Trump could have promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved.

But if Democrats' demands were not met, Pelosi said, the Trump administration's ""grave new chapter of lawlessness"" would necessitate drastic action.

""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest,"" Pelosi said.

FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED

Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have hard evidence that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia.

“Why doesn’t the president just say, ‘Release the whistleblower complaint.’ Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,” Schiff said. “This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.”

“We may have crossed the Rubicon here,” he added, referring to the river that Julius Caesar fatefully traversed in 49 BC. “I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment. ... but that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.”

The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery tweet: ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it.""

Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.

Trump acknowledged Sunday that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.""

The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call.

GIULIANI CLARIFIES CONFUSING CNN COMMENTS ON UKRAINE

Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, has long said publicly he wanted Ukraine to look into the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine, and admitted this week that he's asked Ukraine to do so in the past -- but denied any impropriety or illegal conduct again on Sunday.

""This violation is about our national security,"" Pelosi said. ""The Inspector General determined that the matter is 'urgent' and therefore we face an emergency that must be addressed immediately.""

Inspector General Michael Atkinson of the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) wrote in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But, the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an ""urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress.

Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and denied delaying any military aid funding.

HOUSE INTEL RANKING REPUBLICAN: THIS IS THE END OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN

""Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,"" Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday.

In her statement, Pelosi said Democrats would be watching closely.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said. ""Thank you for your patriotism.""

Even some Republicans cautioned that the situation could be serious. Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, a onetime Trump presidential rival, tweeted that ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival,"" that ""would be troubling in the extreme.""

At the same time, California Rep. Devin Nunes predicted on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Biden's campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of the newly resurfaced reports about his possible misconduct in Ukraine that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race.""

The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren surging ahead of Biden as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June.

Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE

""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

And earlier this year, The Hill reported that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats, and that they'd been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department.

A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump told Fox News that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed the DOJ would review them.

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better."" — Former Trump campaign adviser Barry Bennett

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who claimed Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy.

Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power.""

WATCH: LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS NO ONE HAS REALLY LOOKED INTO BIDENS AND THEIR DEALINGS IN UKRAINE

""Trump’s doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum, and he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden told reporters in Iowa.

Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken ""just once"" about it.

""And now, he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,"" Trump said. ""Of course you spoke to your son!""

Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine, and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation.""

Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: These are the highest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We've never done it to this level.

ROBERTS: The United States continues its campaign of maximum pressure on the Islamic regime and --

MARK ESPER, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature.

ROBERTS: Points the finger at Tehran for those Saudi oil attacks.

MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We know precisely who conducted these attacks, it was Iran.

ROBERTS: We'll ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the options on the table live only on ""FOX News Sunday"".

Then, we'll get reaction from Democrat Ben Cardin, a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It's a ""FOX News Sunday"" exclusive.

Plus, reports the president had an inappropriate phone call with the president of Ukraine.

REPORTER: Did you discuss Joe Biden, his son, or his family?

TRUMP: It doesn't matter what I discussed. It's a partisan whistle- blower.

JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know I'm up against it. A serial abuser. That's what this guy is. He abuses power everywhere he can.

ROBERTS: We'll discuss with President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

Plus, ask or send a panel how the growing controversy is fueling impeachment talks. All right now on ""FOX News Sunday"".

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERTS: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

The war of words over the Saudi oil attacks, which the United States blames on Iran, has turned into action, the Pentagon announcing it will send more troops to the region to boost security for allies and President Trump approving new sanctions on Iran's central bank.

But the president also signaling he is not inclined to authorize an immediate military strike, which the Iranian regime has declared would mean all-out war. In a moment, we'll speak with the president's top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, who just returned from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.

But first, Kevin Corke is traveling with the president, who has a rally today in Houston with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Kevin, good morning.

KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: John, good day to be with you.

Right. We'll have more on that rally coming up in just a few moments, but by any measure, John, the Iranians are suffering greatly under this latest round of U.S. sanctions, just one of many weapons in the U.S. arsenal as it considers what to do next about Iran's Saudi attack.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

TRUMP: We have just sanction the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions.

CORKE: We'll see what happens, a familiar refrain from President Trump. When asked with the U.S. might do next to respond to Iran's attacks on Saudi oil fields. Iran denies it was behind those attacks. In addition to more sanctions, the president has authorized sending a battery of U.S. forces to the region at Saudi request.

ESPER: As the president has made clear, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran. That said, we have many other military options available should they be necessary.

CORKE: The strikes, which Washington says it can prove came from Iran, have pushed the regent to the brink.

For its part, Tehran is threatening to escalate the violence should the U.S. or the Saudis attack even in limited form.

MAJOR GENERAL HOSSEIN SALAMI, IRAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDER: A limited invasion will not remain limited. We hand down and punish. We have proven it before.

CORKE: That warning comes under day that saw the regime put its military capabilities on display, with a series of parades to mark the 39th anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq war and comes months after the Iranians downed and a American surveillance drone in international airspace.

This in a week that will see a gathering of world leaders at United Nations General Assembly in New York where Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he'll present a Gulf security plan.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE: All this as the U.S. welcomes another world leader. This time it's Narendra Modi, as you mentioned, the prime minister of India. He's here for a ""Howdy, Modi"" Texas rally with President Trump. It is set to be the largest American audience to see a foreign leader speak other than the pope.

We'll bring it to you throughout the day. But for now, thank you.

ROBERTS: OK, Kevin Corke, thanks very much.

The president with an afternoon event with Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia as well.

Kevin, we'll see you soon. Thanks.

Joining me now from New York is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Mr. Secretary, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"".

POMPEO: John, it's great to be with you.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, earlier in the week, you said of the attack against the Saudi oil facilities that it was, quote, an act of war, and you said that Iran was definitely behind it. When you say something is an act of war, does that demand ultimately a military response?

POMPEO: Well, John, our mission set has been very clear. President Trump would like to have a diplomatic solution, that's the task that's in front of us. That's what we've been aiming for for a little over two years now with the strongest sanctions that have ever been put in place against this revolutionary regime.

And, John, you know the history. Forty years of terror from Iran. It's an anti-Semitic set of leaders that would like to wipe Israel and America from the face of the earth. Our mission set is to avoid war.

You saw what Secretary Esper announced on Friday, we're putting additional forces in the region for the purpose of deterrence and defense, with our objective to be very clear, to support the Iranian people so that they can get this regime to cease behaving in a way that is so destructive not only to their own country, but to the entire Middle East.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, there are reports this morning that Houthi militants in Yemen have warned both Saudi Arabia and the United States that Iran may be planning another attack in Saudi Arabia. Is that true?

POMPEO: So, I've certainly seen that reporting and I won't talk about American intelligence and what we know. But suffice it to say, we are consistently concerned that Iran will continue to behave in the way that it has now for 40 years, it did so before the JCPOA, it did so during the JCPOA, and they continue to act in ways that are inconsistent with our obligations.

I'm here this week at the United Nations. I traveled to Jeddah and to Abu Dhabi this week.

The whole world understands that Iran is the bad actor. They are the evil force in the region. They are destabilizing in the Middle East, and I hope this week here in New York, the whole world will come together to push back against this and convince the Iranian leadership that this behavior is simply unacceptable.

ROBERTS: That may be a tough hill to climb though, yes?

POMPEO: I think there's a handful of countries that are actually supportive of Iran and what Iran is doing are certainly unwilling to push back. But it's the case; this is the world's responsibility to respond from these state-on-state acts of war that took place in Saudi Arabia this past week.

ROBERTS: If Iran were to launch, in the middle of all of this, another attack against Saudi Arabia, would the United States have any other option but to respond militarily?

POMPEO: John, unlike the previous administration, we try -- we do our best to avoid talking about what we will do, but the American people should know, just like the Iranian people should know, America is prepared to respond in ways that are consistent with America's national security interests.

Our first aim, of course, is to keep the American people safe and secure, and part of that is to make sure that we have all the things in place so that we can do that.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, many military and foreign policy experts, even members of the president's own support group, believe that in calling off the retaliatory strike in response to that drone shoot-down at the last minute, the president signaled to Iran that there are no consequences for its malign activities. What do you say to that criticism?

POMPEO: Well, first of all, there have been consequences, real consequences. The Iranian economy will shrink by between 10 and 15 percent in the year in front of us, and we took a handful of actions, some of which I can't talk about here. So there were certainly consequences.

The Iranians aren't looking for a green light. The Iranians have behaved poorly for 40 years. And so, it's not the case that any particular response has allowed the Iranians to think they have freedom to move about the cabin (ph).

I assure you of this: the Iranian leadership understands four-square that President Trump will take appropriate action and impose appropriate costs on Iran if they continue to act in the way that they've done over these past now 40 years.

ROBERTS: You mentioned, Mr. Secretary, at the beginning of this, the sanctions that President Trump put on Iran. On Friday, he said that there were sanctions at the highest level. If these sanctions don't work, what's next? What's left?

POMPEO: Well, they are working, John. The toughest of the sanctions, the essential ban on the -- Iran's ability to sell its crude oil around the world took effect only --

(CROSSTALK)

POMPEO: -- in May of this year.

ROBERTS: But what I mean is if they don't work -- if they don't work to bring Iran to the table.

POMPEO: As Secretary Esper said on Friday night, we're prepared to act in ways that are necessary in order to achieve the outcome President Trump has very clearly laid out. I talked about it a year ago, in May. We know what the objectives are. We simply want Iran to behave like a normal nation.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, is it possible that if there were a retaliatory military strike against Iran, that it would be able to be contained, or would it, as Javad Zarif and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Council have warned, erupt into all-out conflagration in the Middle East, which would likely involve U.S. bases in the region, would likely also possibly involve Israel?

POMPEO: We're certainly deeply aware of the risks. That's why we want to resolve this in a way that doesn't resort to kinetic action, if it's at all possible to achieve that.

But as for Zarif, I don't know why nobody listens to him. He has nothing to do with Iranian foreign policy. He lies all the time.

We need to make sure that we do the right things to protect and secure America and do our best to provide the resources to the Emirates and the Saudis, who I had a chance to speak to this week on my trip, so that they have increased capability to defend themselves and their own people. And when we -- when we do those things, I'm confident that we will have set the conditions for deterrence. And if that deterrence should continue to fail, I'm also confident President Trump will take the actions that are necessary.

ROBERTS: All right. We will see what happens at the United Nations General Assembly this week. I'll see you there later on today.

Let's switch to this whistleblower complaint. We still don't know the exact substance of the complaint but it does seem to revolve around a July 25th conversation the president had with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

And we have heard from reporting in ""The Wall Street Journal"" that the president asked Zelensky about eight times to have the Ukraine work with his attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's involvement in Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company.

To your mind, is that an appropriate conversation for Rudy Giuliani to be having with Ukrainian officials?

POMPEO: Well, John, you're asking me to comment on an I.C. (ph) report I haven't seen and some reporting -- I have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever.

As for appropriate action, I've watched the president engage with the Ukrainian leadership. I listened to conversations. I remember the previous administration refusing to send defensive weapon systems to Ukraine. This president has chosen to do that not once, not twice, but now three times, so that the Ukraine people could fight back against the overtaking of southeast Ukraine.

You remember, it was the previous administration that allowed Vladimir Putin to take one fifth of the Ukrainian country.

We're going to see President Zelensky this week. I do hope -- I do hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate, if he had a conflict of interest or entered (ph) -- or allowed something to take place in Ukraine which may have interfered in our elections in 2016, I do hope that we get to the bottom of that.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, you said that you have not seen the complaint, not many people have. I assume, though, that you have seen a transcript of the telephone call that the president had with Zelensky.

Should a transcript of that be released to clear the air?

POMPEO: I'll ultimately leave that to the White House. But you know, John, those are private conversations between world leaders, and it's -- it's not often that those are released. And when they're done, it's done when the White House deems it appropriate. And I'll leave whether that should be released to them.

ROBERTS: Again, I assume that you've seen the transcript. Is it as described in ""The Wall Street Journal""?

POMPEO: You know, I haven't seen ""The Wall Street Journal"" piece, John. There's a lot going on in the world.

ROBERTS: Right.

The whistleblower complaint reportedly alleges a quid pro quo or a promise made to a foreign leader. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reports there was no evidence of a quid pro quo in that call with Zelensky. Was there a quid pro quo -- was there a request to investigate Biden and/or his son? And was that linked to a promise of aid?

POMPEO: John, I've watched this president evaluate how and when and to the extent we should provide support to Ukraine, both defense assistance and other foreign assistance, we've been at the center of that.

Those conversations have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful, and 100 percent ensuring that the American taxpayers were protected, that we put those resources to good use and we've got good outcomes in Ukraine when we used American taxpayer dollars to support the Ukrainian leadership -- every single time, John.

ROBERTS: If there was a quid pro quo, would that be a problem?

POMPEO: John, you're asking me to provide legal analysis on a hypothetical on a report I haven't seen. Come on.

ROBERTS: I mean, if an American leader says to a foreign leader, we will do this and it might have something to do with USA, in exchange for this, is that a problem?

POMPEO: John, it's the case we have foreign assistance that is evaluated against American objectives consistently. It's my duty to protect America by making sure that when foreign assistance is provided to countries, that America benefit from that. And it's completely appropriate to make sure that American taxpayer dollars are used appropriately.

ROBERTS: Do believe that there should be an investigation into Hunter Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian gas company?

POMPEO: I'll leave that to others, but I certainly think it's appropriate if there's concerns and there's enough information to justify looking into it. The American people deserve to know if that was handled in an appropriate way by Vice President Biden.

ROBERTS: Just before we go, Mr. Secretary, are you ruling out a run for the Senate from Kansas next year?

POMPEO: I've said the same thing, John, for a long time. As long as President Trump is going to have me as secretary of state, which I hope is a long time, that's what I'm going to continue to do.

ROBERTS: I'm sure he wants you as secretary of state for a long time. I'm just wondering if you still have aspirations for the Senate.

POMPEO: It's what I want to do, too. I want to be President Trump's secretary of state.

ROBERTS: All right. Secretary Pompeo, we'll see you later on in New York.

POMPEO: Thank you, sir.

ROBERTS: Thanks for joining us.

We'll be following all the action, of course, at the United Nations General Assembly next week.

ROBERTS: Interactions between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and the president of Ukraine are under scrutiny following reports of a whistle- blower complaint, claiming that the president urged the Ukrainian to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, potentially influencing the 2020 race.

Joining me here live in Washington to talk more about this is Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.

Rudy, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday.""

RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How are you? How are you, John?

ROBERTS: I'm good. Thanks for joining us.

Let's clear something up, first of all.

GIULIANI: Sure.

ROBERTS: Let's dial the clock back to Thursday, play this exchange between you and Chris Cuomo on CNN, in which you appeared to at first say you didn't ask Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and/or his son, and then you seemed to change her mind.

GIULIANI: Right.

ROBERTS: Listen. Listen here.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: Did you to ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?

GIULIANI: No.

Actually, I didn't.

CUOMO: You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden...

GIULIANI: The only thing I asked about Joe Biden...

CUOMO: ... and his role with the prosecutor?

GIULIANI: ... is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed...

CUOMO: Right.

GIULIANI: ... dismissed the case against AntAC.

CUOMO: So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?

GIULIANI: Of course I did.

CUOMO: You just said you didn't.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: All right, so which is it? Did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask Ukraine to look into it or not?

(CROSSTALK)

GIULIANI: I clarified it immediately.

ROBERTS: All right.

GIULIANI: He said to me, did you ever talk about Joe Biden? I said no. Then I said, I did say that you should investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.

The no was obviously wrong. I corrected it immediately.

ROBERTS:

GIULIANI: I corrected it before he corrected it.

The reality is, the distinction is this. What they are trying to say is, I went there for a political mission to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble.

Ridiculous.

I went there as a lawyer defending his client. I -- I have known about this for five months. I have been trying to get people to cover this for five months. So, I knew it would be very, very hard to get this out.

And what I'm talking about, this, it's Ukrainian collusion, which was large, significant, and proven with Hillary Clinton, with the Democratic National Committee, a woman named Chalupa, with the ambassador, with an FBI agent who's now been hired by George Soros who was funding a lot of it.

When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor, who Biden approved -- you don't get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country, unless something fishy is going on.

The new prosecutor dropped the case, not just on Biden's kid and the crooked company that Biden's kid work for, Burisma. That was done as a matter of record in October of 2016, after the guy got tanked.

He also dropped the case on George Soros' company called AntAC. AntAC is the company where there's documentary evidence that they were producing false information about Trump, about Biden. Fusion GPS was there.

Go back and listen to Nellie Ohr's testimony. Nellie Ohr says that there was a lot of contract between Democrats and the Ukraine.

Well, I have all the contacts. And, John, when the rest of this comes out, and when you look at China and the $1.5 billion that the -- that the Biden family took out of China while that guy was negotiating for us, this will be a lot bigger than Spiro Agnew.

They have fallen into a trap.

ROBERTS: So, you went over there to investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election?

GIULIANI: Yes. And if I can't do that, I can't defend a client.

I...

ROBERTS: All right, so when did this morph into an investigation of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?

And is it appropriate for you, as a representative of the president, to be going to Ukraine and finding dirt on Joe Biden and/or his son to use politically in 2020?

GIULIANI: Well, that's the way you characterize it. It's certainly appropriate...

ROBERTS: That's the way it appears to line up.

GIULIANI: No, it doesn't.

ROBERTS: You went there for one thing, you found out something else, and that's what you have been digging on this.

(CROSSTALK)

GIULIANI: That's the way the pro-Biden media lines it up.

This began with someone coming to me saying, this information can clear your client about the corruption in Ukraine between the Ukraine, the Democratic Party, the ambassador, and the FBI agent who investigated the case.

(CROSSTALK)

ROBERTS: But it then -- but then it morphs into Biden.

GIULIANI: And -- inextricably combined, because Biden had the guy fired, Shokin.

By the way, his statement is on record. The lazy press could go read it. They don't have to listen to me. There are three videotapes of prosecutors on record, available on here, that nobody has covered for five months, because this town protects Joe Biden.

His family has been taking money from his public office for years, $1.5 billion from China, when our vice president is supposed to be impartially and independently negotiating for us? And the kid, he takes him on Air Force Two to China, and the kid...

ROBERTS: That was in 2013.

GIULIANI: Yes.

And the kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict. China didn't give $1.5 billion to his kid, Biden's kid, a recovering drug addict, Kerry's stepson, and Whitey Bulger's nephew.

Ladies and gentlemen, go look at what the press has been covering up on you. Can you imagine...

ROBERTS: This is a company called Rosemont Seneca.

Let me just -- let me just come back, if I could.

GIULIANI: You got to stop for a second.

Whitey Bulger's nephew?

ROBERTS: Let me just stop for a second.

GIULIANI: One-point-five billion coming from China, when our vice president...

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Mr. Mayor...

GIULIANI: That doesn't shock you?

ROBERTS: ... let me stop for a second, because...

GIULIANI: I mean, how far have we deteriorated?

ROBERTS: Let me stop for a second, because we are throwing around a lot of Ukrainian names that people don't know about.

GIULIANI: Well, that's because nobody would ever cover this.

ROBERTS: Viktor Shokin was a prosecutor back when Biden was the vice president.

He was looking into Burisma Holdings...

GIULIANI: Right.

ROBERTS: ... of which Hunter Biden was on the board of directors.

GIULIANI: Correct.

ROBERTS: There were some allegations that there was some monkey business going on with Burisma.

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Joe Biden -- Joe Biden -- Joe Biden went over to Ukraine in 2016...

GIULIANI: Right.

ROBERTS: ... and said that, I'm going to withhold more than a billion dollars in loan guarantees unless you fire this prosecutor.

Joe Biden talked about that in 2018. Let's roll that.

GIULIANI: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here.

And I think it was, what, six hours. I look at it. I said, we're leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: But Shokin had been heavily criticized for corruption.

And it was the United States and a number of other Western countries who said...

GIULIANI: So is everybody in the Ukraine.

ROBERTS: ... he needs to go.

GIULIANI: More relevant...

ROBERTS: So, was this tied to Hunter Biden, or was this the United States saying, you have got a bad actor there, because he was accused of corruption in his office? And other countries in the West were saying he needs to go as well.

GIULIANI: What does it matter, if the -- if the son is under investigation? He didn't disclose that.

Doesn't the thing strike you? I mean, it is so warped. Doesn't it strike you as strange that he would tell that story and not mention to you that his son's company was the major defendant in the investigation, the guy who was carrying on?

Do you -- I happen to know -- and I have seen the records -- do you know why he was fired? Do you know how the kid was paid? Three million dollars goes from Ukraine to Cyprus -- I'm sorry -- Ukraine to Latvia, Latvia to Cyprus, Cyprus to Rosemont Seneca.

I have seen each one of the wires.

When that prosecutor, Shokin, subpoenaed Cyprus, he got a response. I have the record. They gave him all the information, but two people, Hunter Biden and John Kerry's stepson -- I'm sorry -- John Kerry's speechwriter, who was the best friend of his stepson.

ROBERTS: The prosecutor who followed..

GIULIANI: When that happened, Joe Biden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter.

And he went over there and he got him fired. And the next day, people showed up. And they started on getting the case for the kid dismissed, as well as the case for Soros. And that's what brings me into it.

ROBERTS: Now, the prosecutor -- the prosecutor...

GIULIANI: No, you got to let me finish.

ROBERTS: OK.

GIULIANI: He said, I went there to get dirt on Joe Biden.

Do you know, when I found out about Joe Biden, do know what I told my colleague? They are going to cover this up.

Too bad Biden is involved in this. I got a nice straight case of Ukrainian collusion. The minute I say Biden, that Washington press corps is going to go nuts. They have been covering up for years, China, plagiarism.

ROBERTS: OK. OK. All right.

Now you're straying into areas of opinion, as opposed to fact.

GIULIANI: No, I'm not. I'm straying into what is wrong with us today and the unfairness.

ROBERTS: We need to point out -- we need to point out that Yuriy Lutsenko, who was the prosecutor who was appointed after Shokin was fire...

GIULIANI: Approved by...

ROBERTS: ... resurrected, reanimated the case, and found that Hunter Biden was, in fact, paid millions of dollars.

But Lutsenko said that the board of Burisma was able to pay a board member whatever they wanted, and he didn't see anything wrong with that.

GIULIANI: John, how is the coverage so distorted?

ROBERTS: I'm just pointing out a fact.

GIULIANI: If you did any work, you would find out Lutsenko is the prosecutor that Biden put in.

There's a newspaper article in which Biden approves Lutsenko when he's appointed. Doesn't that strike you as odd, that the vice president would approve a particular prosecutor?

Did you ever bother to look?

(CROSSTALK)

GIULIANI: Let me finish.

ROBERTS: One other point we need to make here before we go.

GIULIANI: No, no, no, I want answer another question unless you let me finish. This is really unfair.

These are very important things that have been covered up for years to protect slimy Joe.

The reality is that there are three other prosecutors where all you have to do is go online, three others, that say that this was done precisely to get rid of Biden, to cover up Hunter, and to cover up Soros.

I will give you their names. One of them is Kulik, Konstantin Kulik. The other is Shokin himself. And the third one is a prosecutor by the name of Inazdir (ph).

They are present officials. Three of them were officials. One is still an official of the Ukrainian government.

If you bothered to look, you could listen to them on tape telling you that. Now, they may all be lying, but Lutsenko may be lying also. But it's 3-1.

ROBERTS: One more point we got to make.

GIULIANI: And Lutsenko is Biden's chosen prosecutor.

ROBERTS: OK. You have made your point.

One more point to make we need to make.

GIULIANI: You will also find there is a great deal of suspicion.

ROBERTS: Yes, Joe Biden yesterday told our Peter -- Joe Biden told our Peter Doocy yesterday that he never discussed overseas business with his son Hunter.

GIULIANI: Do you believe that?

ROBERTS: I don't know. Do you believe that?

GIULIANI: I'm flying my son to China. How long is the flight to China?

ROBERTS: Its a while.

GIULIANI: Fifteen hours, 16 hours, 17?

I'm flying my son to China on Air Force Two. I'm going to negotiate with the Chinese to help America. My son is going there to negotiate to help the Biden family.

When he comes back, and eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict, somebody connected to the vice president of the United States and somebody connected to the biggest gangster in America.

Wait a second. The son doesn't say to him, I got a billion dollars? By the way, you see what Joe said? It's contradicted by the son. The son said, I talked to my father about it.

How about this? There was an article on December 9 of 2015 in ""The New York Times"" raising holy hell about Biden's son being on the board of the most corrupt company in Ukraine and how strange it looked.

I don't know if Joe reads the newspapers, but somebody must have read that to him.

And, finally, if Joe didn't know what his son was doing abroad, how may conflicts are there? This guy was flying blind? I don't know. Did he get money from Russia? Did he get money from Cuba? Was he doing business in Venezuela?

You're telling me that the vice president of the United States was there for eight years. His son is going around the world taking millions from some adversary of the United States.

ROBERTS: Yes.

GIULIANI: Don't say yes. This is important.

ROBERTS: No, no, we have -- I'm saying we have got to go.

GIULIANI: This is about the only time I have gotten to point out a tremendously large scandal that affects the American people.

And it's your job to do it, not just mine. I'm doing it to defend my client.

ROBERTS: We are out of time.

GIULIANI: But you're telling me that he had no system with his son to check on conflicts? So we know of two.

We know there's a big conflict with Ukraine. We know there is a big conflict with China. Since Joe says and is apparently selling the swamp media on the fact that he didn't know, well, Joe, how many more conflicts are there? Venezuela? Cuba?

ROBERTS: You have mentioned that.

We have got to leave it. Mr. Mayor, we are...

GIULIANI: One-point-five billion is enough for most people to get investigated.

ROBERTS: We are out of time for this morning, but, clearly, we are going to keep looking into this.

GIULIANI: And this is going to get bigger and bigger. And everything I say, I can prove.

ROBERTS: Rudy, thanks so much for being with us.

GIULIANI: Take me on.

ROBERTS: All right. Appreciate it.

Coming up, we will get reaction to the president's Iran policy with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Ben Cardin joins us here next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: Coming up, President Trump authorizes new economic penalties on Iran.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We have just sanctioned the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the move will bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: As the United States boosts its defenses in the Middle East after blaming Iran for the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, the Islamic regime says it's ready for any scenario.

Joining me here in Washington, Senator Ben Cardin, a top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator, welcome back to “Fox News Sunday.”

SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MD: John, it's great to be with you. Thank you.

ROBERTS: So the U.S. is sending more troops and defensive weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to counter the threat coming from Iran.

Your thoughts about sending more men and material there?

CARDIN: John, this is a very dangerous situation. There could easily be a miscalculation. The temperature couldn't be harder between the United States and Iran.

Our job is to isolate Iran. Iran is the bad actor. And what the president needs to do is get an international coalition to continue to work against Iran's support of terrorism. The challenge, of course, is, because, as the United States has been isolated when the president withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. So we're having difficulty with our European allies to get the type of support we need, but we have to isolate Iran.

ROBERTS: There are reports that -- from the Houthis apparently to Saudi Arabia and to the United States, I don't know if you saw my question to the secretary of state, that Iran is planning another attack in Saudi Arabia.

If Iran were, in the middle of all of this, launch another attack at Saudi Arabia, would that demand a military response?

CARDIN: There's really not a military solution to the problem of Iran. We need to make diplomacy work. Clearly there could be a miscalculation. We have to defend ourselves, no question about that, but we have to reduce the temp -- where we are, where we could have this miscalculation.

It would be disastrous if we got into a fighting war in Iran. It will have consequences throughout the entire region. It's not in our national security interests.

ROBERTS: All right, so we've got the United States ramping up sanctions on Iran, withdrawing from the JCPOA, which you yourself didn't -- didn't vote for. And Iran is countering by shooting down American drones, firing missiles and launching drones at Saudi oil facilities. I mean they are in a shooting war. So is -- is this -- is this -- I mean if you let somebody fire at you and you don't shoot back, are you not showing weakness?

CARDIN: Well, John, here -- here's the fault of the Trump policies. Before we withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreements, there were conversations with the Europeans about strengthening the sanctions against Iran for the non- nuclear violations. We could have had that international support and tightens the economic pressure against Iran, but still stay within the nuclear agreement. By pulling out of the nuclear agreement, it's the view of Europe that this is an American problem rather than an international problem.

ROBERTS: But -- but you know the arguments, this president said, look, it covers the nuclear, but it -- there's a sunset clause to it of a decade, which isn't much when you look at, you know, the history of nuclear development. But it also does not do anything to reign in Iran's malign activities.

I pointed out, you yourself did not vote for the JCPOA because you were worried about future uranium enrichment.

So why stay in a bad deal?

CARDIN: No, I agree with that analysis, but the way to fix it is to work with Europe, work with our partners to deal with the non-nuclear violations, strengths the sanctions against Iran on the non-nuclear side, make sure they stay in compliance with the nuclear obligations. They were in compliance with the nuclear obligations when the United States pulled out.

The bottom line is, we made -- the -- we isolated the United States rather than isolating Iran, and Iran is the bad actor. There's no question about it. We don't know what they're going to do, but we certainly need the support of our international partners.

ROBERTS: But how serious is Iran about the JCPOA? The United States pulled out. There is still five signatories to it, yet Iran is violating the agreement.

CARDIN: Well, the issue is, Iran -- we don't know how Iran's calculating this, but we do know that the U.S. sanctions is having a major impact on their economy. So the benefits they thought they were going to get under the nuclear agreement, they're no longer getting.

ROBERTS: Right.

CARDIN: That's causing them to recalculate.

ROBERTS: For the moment, President Trump says he's showing restraint about Iran. He's got people like Secretary Pompeo saying it's an act of war. Others are pointing fingers, like Mark Esper and Pompeo at Iran. The president saying, I'm going to sit back and wait and see how this plays out. Listen to what he said in the Oval Office the other day.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I think the strong person's approach and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint. Much easier to do it the -- the other way. It's much easier. And Iran knows, if they misbehave, they're on borrowed time.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: So you've got the president's aides on the one hand saying, act of war, Iran's responsible. The president saying, I'm waiting and seeing her. He's leaving the door open to negotiation, even amidst all this tough talk.

Could that be a good strategy to try to bring them to the table?

CARDIN: I think it's an important week with all the world leaders -- most of the world leaders meeting up in New York for the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations.

I hope that we can get that type of unity with the international community in regards to Iran so that the military option is not the right option. I agree with Secretary Pompeo that diplomacy should be the way we proceed. I agree with that.

And hopefully this week we can get the type of support in New York to make a difference in the calculation by Iran so that they stop these horrible things.

What they're doing is horrible. We can't let them continue to do that.

ROBERTS: Let me switch to this intelligence committee inspector general whistle-blower report. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported on Friday that the president had a conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in which he about eight times pressured Zelensky to have Ukraine work with Rudy Giuliani to look into Joe Biden.

The Ukrainian foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said today, quote, I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. So you have Democrats on the one side calling for the president's impeachment over this, and then you have the Ukrainian foreign minister saying, I don't see any pressure.

CARDIN: I think we need to know what happened. The allegations are that the president used the power of his office for partisan political purposes, jeopardizing the national security of the United States by withholding aid to Ukraine, one of our key, strategic partners. That --

ROBERTS: Nobody's made the connection about aid yet. We don't even know what this thing's about.

CARDIN: We -- we -- at least there's been some reports that there was $250 million that were held up, ultimately was released --

ROBERTS: I think people have connected the dots, but I don't think we've got anything really to back that up.

CARDIN: Well, that's what -- let's find out. Let's -- let's find -- let's have transparency here. We can easily find that out if information about those phone calls would be released and we could see exactly what's involved. But the president has chosen, at least to date, not to release that information.

These are serious allegations. Let's find out.

I -- I -- I don't want to reach a conclusion. I'm just suggesting to you that an allegation that the president used his political office for partisan reasons, jeopardizing our national security, we need to get to the facts.

ROBERTS: Is there a case to be made to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's -- their involvement in Ukraine? Let's listen to what the president said and what Joe Biden said the other day.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he is not giving to a certain country less a certain prosecutor is taken off the case.

BIDEN: Not one single, credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion. Not one single one. And so I have no comment except the president should start to (INAUDIBLE).

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: Now, in fact, a lot of credible news organizations, including ""The New York Times,"" have been looking into this. Ken Vogel, who's the reporter who wrote about it -- and here's the article -- back in May said on Friday that there's -- this could be a significant issue for Joe Biden and that there's more there.

CARDIN: Well -- well, John, I know what happened in 2015 with the prosecutor. The international community needed that prosecutor to leave. Congress wanted that prosecutor to leave. Corruption was the center problem we had with Ukraine, maintaining our coalition against Russia for -- with sanctions. And we had to deal with the corrupt issues and the prosecutor was in the center of that. So that -- that was a policy that we wanted to implement.

Joe Biden's issue has been looked at for a long time. There's been findings that there is no improper involvement. This is a distraction by the president of the United States to distract from his most recent situation.

ROBERTS: You don't want to prejudge the situation with the president and his whistle-blower, but a lot of your Democratic colleagues are already making the leap to impeachment.

Is that going too far?

CARDIN: I -- I think you need to get the facts. I don't think you should -- you know, the impeachment process is a way in which Congress exercises its responsibility, checks and balances in our system. But you can't act on that type of a remedy until you have the facts. So let's get the facts first.

ROBERTS: Senator Cardin, always good to see you.

CARDIN: Nice to be with you.

ROBERTS: Thanks so much for coming in.

Coming up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the prospects of a showdown between the United States and Iran.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: I think it's abundantly clear and there is an enormous consensus in the region that we know precisely who conducted these attacks. It was Iran.

NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What would be the consequence of an American or a Saudi military strike on Iran now?

MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: An all-out war.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: The top diplomats from this country and Iran in a war of words this week over the fallout from the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil industry.

And its time now for our Sunday group. Jonah Goldberg for ""The National Review,"" Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, Susan Page of ""USA Today,"" and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of ""The Washington Free Beacon.""

Are we going to war, Susan, with Iran?

SUSAN PAGE, ""USA TODAY"": Well, judging from your interview with Secretary of State Pompeo, I'd say probably not. He -- you asked them if it's an active war, does that demand a military response, and he repeatedly denied -- declined to say yes. And judging from what the president did in June, after the American drone was shot down and he backed away from a military strike, I think the odds are against us taking military action in this case.

ROBERTS: The fact that he backed away from that strike, does that mean that he cannot take military action?

MATTHEW CONTINETTI, ""WASHINGTON FREE BEACON"": No. I mean he could take military action at any time. He's the commander-in-chief. What we're seeing, though, is that the maximum pressure campaign of the Trump administration has met maximum resistance from the Iranian regime. And the cyber operations and the economic warfare that the Trump White House has been waging against Iran has yet to deter them from their malign behavior in the region. But, that status quo is something I think the president prefers to all-out war.

ROBERTS: Right. It -- the -- Congress is saying he's got to come to Congress for an authorization to use military force against Iran. First of all, does he have to? And if he went to Congress, would he get it?

JONAH GOLDBERG, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": It depends. I think we would need more provocation than what we have seen. I'm sort of a purist on this kind of stuff. I do think that you should go to Congress, unless it's in response to an immediate and urgent national security thing, then it -- Congress has the -- has the sole authority to authorize war. But we've seen that eroded so much over the last 50 years, like so many other congressional prerogatives that I think it's anybody's guess.

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think, John, based on your question, you can tell there's no clear end game in sight. What we know is the president says he doesn't want war there, but he's previously also said we're locked and loaded. And what was incredible to me was to hear him say that he's waiting for guidance to come from the Saudis.

Now, the Iranians are no friends of ours, but, gosh, the Saudis, I don't know if they're a reliable and trustworthy regime. They kill American journalists. 9/11 is not to be forgotten.

ROBERTS: And here's another argument that people made. The United States has sold Saudi Arabia, and the president made a big deal of this, billions of dollars in military equipment. Can't the Saudis handle this themselves?

PAGE: And -- well, I guess we're going to find out. I mean we're making this gesture to Saudi Arabia with a very limited deployment. But -- but, yes, Saudi Arabia has a lot of defensive abilities, a lot of it provided by the United States, helped by the United States.

WILLIAMS: But I think the key point here is, Iran has denied responsibility, but we have no reason to trust that they are not responsible, or at least supporting the Houthi rebels that did this.

But the point from the American political perspective is, we are still trying to get out of Afghanistan. There is no appetite in his country for starting another war without a clear end game in sight. And the president has not provided that.

CONTINETTI: And the president's policy, it reflects exactly that attitude though.

WILLIAMS: Right. We all know what we're doing (ph).

PAGE: And the president's base doesn't back it either (ph).

CONTINETTI: He doesn't want to get involved either.

What's remarkable here, for 70 years plus, the United States has guaranteed the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. That is ending. At its ending because of fracking.

ROBERTS: Let's get on to the whistle-blower issue here.

President Trump, he was leaving for Houston a short time ago. He said this about his conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of the Ukraine, back on July 25th.

Listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: The conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely perfect. And people better find out who these people are that are trying to subvert our country, because here we go again. These are bad people.

But the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely a ten.

ROBERTS: So it was a ten. Is there anything wrong with the president saying to the president of the Ukraine, look, why don't you work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate what ties Joe Biden and Hunter Biden have to Ukrainian natural gas companies.

PAGE: Yes. It's soliciting foreign help in your campaign for re-election for president of the United States. And it's something that I think people would generally find alarming.

ROBERTS: Now, the Ukraine helped Hillary Clinton, so --

GOLDBERG: Yes, OK, look, I mean we've got to separate a whole bunch of things here. The idea -- you know, people who are -- you know, President Trump has -- has some weird messaging on this. On the one hand he says it's all made up and fake news. On the other hand he says he was spied on, which would suggest that, in fact, the allegations are true.

Rudy Giuliani comes on air today and take great umbrage at the accusation or insinuation that he's a political hit man, and then he spends the next seven minutes like the -- one of the biggest political hit men I've ever seen. It could be -- I don't -- I think there's a lot of smoke and -- and bluster going on in what Giuliani is doing. It could all be true.

If the president of the United States tried to bend national security, based upon his own partisan self-interest, that would be very, very, very bad. And the people who say he's just interested in corruption, this seems to be the only corruption case in the world he's concerned about, is the one about the guy who's beating him by ten points in the polls.

ROBERTS: ""The Washington Examiner"" had an article this morning that suggested that the whistle-blower does not have firsthand knowledge of any of this. But the point is, is that if you're going to investigate the president, and there are 9,573 investigations of the president going on right now, should you not also investigate the person who might become president?

CONTINETTI: A lot of conversations in Washington over the last 48 hours have begun with the word ""if."" And the fact is, we don't know. And so I think the advocates of impeachment in this case carry a heavy burden, John. One is that with the Russian investigation, there was a whole lot of misreporting and factual inaccuracy in the actual reporting. Two, when the Mueller report came out, it did not provide the data that Democrats wanted to impeach. And, third, all of these charges, as illustrated in Rudy Giuliani's interview with you, have the potential to boomerang on the Democratic Party.

ROBERTS: All right, so let me ask you about the Democratic Party, Juan. You heard Ben Cardin say he doesn't want to prejudge anything. He wants the information. He wants to see this.

You've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You've got Elizabeth Warren. You've got a myriad of other Democrats not even waiting for a shred of evidence here. They're looking at reporting and saying, impeach him, off with his head. I mean should they not wait -- do they not have a responsibility to wait until we know some facts here before we got down the impeachment road?

WILLIAMS: Yes, I think everyone should wait. But, remember, there's no reason to wait on the transcript. If, as the president describes it, nothing untoward took place, why is it that the administration is making such an effort to obstruct the Congress from getting that transcript?

What we know is --

ROBERTS: It's not the transcript that they're not holding back --

WILLIAMS: Well --

ROBERTS: It's the complaint.

WILLIAMS: Well, the complaint, the transcript, the whole thing. If -- because the transcript goes beyond the complaint, which is why I said transcript. But the idea is that this administration has, through the Justice Department, stop what is the law. The law says that if you have an urgent complaint, the inspector general of the director of national intelligence would transfer that to the Congress. It's not going on. That is wrong.

GOLDBERG: Previous presidents have also disputed the idea that the president has an obligation by the -- by statute to do that. It's a -- it's a murky constitutional issue.

PAGE: The one Democrat we haven't heard from calling for impeachment is the one Democrat who counts, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She set a standard that we need to hear Republicans be outraged by the president's behavior, not just Democrats. And so far we haven't heard that.

ROBERTS: Fifteen seconds.

CONTINETTI: We'll be waiting for a long time.

ROBERTS: Yes, Fifteen seconds, should the transcript be released?

WILLIAMS: Of course.

CONTINETTI: I think if it exculpates Trump, they should release it.

But there is the issue of executive privilege here, governing foreign communications, which also needs to be respected.

WILLIAMS: If this was Obama, House Republicans would have --

ROBERTS: We've got to go.

Thanks, Juan.

See you next Sunday, by the way.

Coming up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" Denzel Washington and the club he says made him the man he is today.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: For many children, the hours between three and 8:00 p.m. are when their futures are decided. As Chris Wallace reported last fall, one organization has opened its doors for over 100 years to make sure that kids have a place to go after school and stay out of trouble. One of those kids became a household name, and he is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DENZEL WASHINGTON, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN: It's where I learned so many life lessons, just thinking I was having fun.

CHRIS WALLACE, HOST (voice over): Denzel Washington is talking with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Four thousand local clubs that provide after-school programs for more than 4 million young people. And, in the process, change lives.

He was in Washington last fall for the group's annual dinner.

WASHINGTON: I remember that first day and how I felt and how special they made me feel.

WALLACE: And to honor the national youth of the year.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Malachi Haynes.

WALLACE: Malachi Haynes of Colorado, who's been going to his club since he was six.

MALACHI HAYNES, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB 2018 YOUTH OF THE YEAR: Being a leader and a role model in my community is my purpose.

WASHINGTON: I was a wild one. You know, I was -- I had a lot of energy.

WALLACE: Washington used to run track for his club. And he remembers when a new kid came in and started running faster. One of his mentors took him aside.

WASHINGTON: He said, he has natural ability, but his natural ability will only take him so far. So I applied that to -- to -- to my career, my first two years when I started acting in college.

WALLACE: Washington won the first of his two Oscars for his role in ""Glory,"" about an African-American military unit in the Civil War.

For more than 30 years, he's played a series of indelible characters.

WASHINGTON: To protect the sheep, you've got to catch the wolf. And it takes a wolf to catch a wolf, you understand?

I was never interested in being a movie star. We were sort of New York theater snobs. I wanted to be James Earl Jones, you know? I was hoping to make $650 on Broadway one day. And -- and I did.

WALLACE (on camera): Your father was a preacher and I've read that at various points in your life you've thought about becoming a preacher.

WASHINGTON: Uh-huh.

WALLACE: Really?

WASHINGTON: It was prophesies that I would preach. And -- by this woman. And I said, well, maybe that's what I'm supposed to do. And says, well, you already have a pulpit.

WALLACE (voice over): Now, Washington is more about giving back.

WASHINGTON: You never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. That's what my pastor told me. You know, you -- whatever you have, you can't take it with you. So the question is, what are you going to do with what you have while you're here?

WALLACE (voice over): The Boys & Girls Clubs deal with the ups and downs of life too. Kids at the clubs do better at school, are less likely to do drugs, and volunteer more. Malachi started his own program to improve reading levels.

HAYNES: We call it Double Trouble. So we do an hour of reading, then an hour of playing basketball, eating pizza, just hanging out and getting to know the kids.

WALLACE: And Denzel Washington says that's the real message here.

WASHINGTON: We're just bombarded so much with negative news that the -- one can just feel like, well, what's the -- what's the use? But listening to these young people saying, oh, no, no, we're going to change it, we're going to do something about it, I'm -- that's inspiring.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERTS: Chris asked Washington where he sees himself at this stage of his career. He says he uses stuntmen more than he used to but is excited about the unknown and what comes next in his life and career.

And that's it for today. Chris is back again next weekend. We will see you next “Fox News Sunday.” Thanks for joining us.

* In Nevada, a new Suffolk University/Reno Gazette Journal poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers shows Joe Biden leading, but his margin over Elizabeth Warren is shrinking. The former vice president has 24% support, followed by Warren at 19%, and Bernie Sanders at 14%. Every other Democratic presidential hopeful was below 5% in this poll.

* Speaking of Sanders, the Vermont senator unveiled a new wealth tax today, including a steep tax specifically targeting billionaires. The longtime independent added that he hopes “the day comes when” billionaires no longer exist.

* According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, a combined 69% of voters say they don’t like Donald Trump personally, “regardless of their feelings about his policy agenda.” Before Trump, the worst any modern president has fared on this question was George W. Bush in March 2006, right after Hurricane Katrina, when 42% of voters said they didn’t like the president personally, regardless of his policies.

* The Democratic National Committee announced new qualifying thresholds for the party’s November presidential primary debate: participants will need to reach 3% support in four polls and 165,000 unique donors. There is, however, a notable twist: the DNC also said that candidates can reach the polling threshold by reaching 5% support in two approved polls from the early nominating states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and/or South Carolina).

* With virtual caucuses ruled out as a result of cybersecurity concerns, Iowa Democrats are moving forward with a series of “satellite” caucuses that will be held on February 3, though not necessarily at the same time.

* A year after 67% of voters ages 18 to 22 voted Democratic, the Republican National Committee is launching a voter-registration campaign intended to mobilize Donald Trump’s on-campus supporters. According to the Associated Press, the effort is called the “Make Campus Great Again” initiative."

* The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll – the most closely watched of all Iowa polls – found Elizabeth Warren taking the lead in the first Democratic nominating contest with 22%, followed by Joe Biden at 20%. Bernie Sanders was third with 11%, followed closely by Pete Buttigieg at 9%. Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with 6% support. (Of the top five candidates, Warren was the only candidate to see her support grow since June.)

* On a related note, it’s worth noting that in the same Iowa poll, local Democrats were asked for their first and second choices, which matter a great deal given the way the state’s caucus system is structured. When first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Warren’s advantage over Biden is even more striking: 42% to 30%. Sanders is further back at 21%, followed by Buttigieg’s 18%.

* Staff shake-ups on Bernie Sanders’ team continue, with the Vermont senator parting ways with one of his Iowa deputy field directors. Kevin Lata had previously worked on Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, as well as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 team.

* In keeping with the recent trend, the Alaska Republican Party became the latest state GOP to officially cancel its Republican presidential primary, which had been scheduled for April. Several state parties have taken similar steps to protect Donald Trump from possible embarrassment against his primary rivals.

* As the General Motors strike continues, several Democratic presidential candidates have visited picket lines to show support for members of the United Auto Workers.

* With some evidence of Texas becoming more competitive, Republican officials are making it easier for Green Party candidates to qualify for the ballot, with the obvious hope that the move will undermine Democratic support.

* Though it’s difficult to know if this is a stunt, Cory Booker’s campaign manager wrote in a new memo to staff and supporters that the New Jersey senator’s presidential campaign may come to an end without another $1.7 million before the end of the quarter. (The third quarter ends a week from today.)

* As expected, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D) officially kicked off a primary campaign in Massachusetts against incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D) over the weekend.

* And following their recent Twitter argument over which one of them is more closely aligned with Trump’s foreign policy, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is reportedly taking steps to undermine Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) prospective U.S. Senate campaign."

WARREN SURGES IN IOWA

Des Moines Register: “Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.”



Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary Juliàn Castro’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.”



Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems - NBC News: “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President Donald Trump, the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)”



The end may be near for Booker - Politico: “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.”

TIME OUT: MEET YOU IN ST. LOUIS

History: “Amid much public excitement, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark return to St. Louis, Missouri, from the first recorded overland journey from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. The Lewis and Clark Expedition had set off more than two years before to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase. Even before the U.S. government concluded purchase negotiations with France, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his private secretary Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, an army captain, to lead an expedition into what is now the U.S. Northwest. On May 14, the ‘Corps of Discovery,’ featuring some two dozen men, left St. Louis for the American interior. … On September 23, 1806, after two and a half years, the expedition returned to the city, bringing back a wealth of information about the largely unexplored region, as well as valuable U.S. claims to Oregon Territory.”

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL

NYT: “President Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.”



Trump continues to defend his call about Biden - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.”



Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint - Politico: “Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’”



Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden - Fox News: “Rudy Giuliani channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden, suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’”



CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK

Roll Call: “The Senate needs to act this week to clear a stopgap spending bill before recessing through the end of the government’s fiscal year, but that is really the only must-pass business for either chamber. The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.”

LET’S GET THIS BREAD

UPI: “A raccoon went for a 16-mile ride on top of a Florida bread delivery truck that reached speeds of over 50 mph during the trip. The driver of the Wonder Bread truck said other drivers called his attention to the raccoon on top of his truck, and he had already traveled about 10 miles before calling 911 from the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Police and the driver attempted to get the raccoon to safety by pulling the truck up to a convenient tree branch, but the animal refused to climb down. The driver said he eventually had to drive the final 6 miles of his journey with the raccoon still riding on the roof. He said the animal eventually apparently climbed down on its own once the truck was parked at his company's headquarters in North Fort Myers.”

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has surged and now enjoys a slight 2-point advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden, the longtime front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

The Monmouth University survey, released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont fading to a distant third.

WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.

Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey.

Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.

New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren.

The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday.

“Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray.

The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent.

According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll.

The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates.

The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend. A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.

“It is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux,” Murray noted."

Elizabeth Warren is making a major television and digital ad buy to spread her message to potential primary voters.

Warren’s presidential campaign announced on Tuesday that the populist Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who’s released one progressive policy proposal after another through the primary campaign, will spend eight figures – or at least $10 million – to place spots on TV and on-line in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Those are the first four states to vote on the primary and caucus calendar.

WARREN SURGING IN NEW 2020 POLLS IN NH, NEVADA, IOWA

“Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,” Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in an email to supporters.

Lau explained that spots “will be more digital than old-school broadcast television, and we have built an in-house staff to produce videos and ads rather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns (and the big commissions and fees that come along with it).”

The Warren campaign confirmed to Fox News that the digital ads would start running immediately, and that they’re currently reserving time for the TV commercials. Officials said the buy would last for several months.

The Warren campaign released three of the ads on Tuesday – 15-second, 30-second and one-minute spots.

“Take any of our big problems – health care, climate change, gun violence. Corruption is at the root of why our government won’t act,” Warren says in the 15-second ad. “I know what’s wrong. I know how to fix it. And I’ll fight to get it done.”

SANDERS UPS THE ANTE WITH WEALTH TAX HIGHER THAN WARREN'S PLAN

Lau also announced the campaign is continuing to expand its staffing. While Warren already has a formidable team in the four early-voting states, Lau spoke of ""hiring state directors and organizers in a number of states that have primaries and caucuses in March. And we're targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020.”

The $10 million ad buy and the expansion of campaign staff suggest that Warren’s fundraising remains strong. After a slow start earlier in the year, the senator hauled in over $19 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising."

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren as the first choice for 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was first choice of 20 percent of the voters.

In June, the Register poll showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders.

While Biden continues to lead in national polls some are concerned about his current standing.

Co-host Jesse Watters pointed out Biden may lose multiple early primaries before he reaches states he polls strongest in.

""I've seen three polls where he's losing to either Warren or Sanders in New Hampshire,"" Watters said.

The push for impeachment has picked up steam in recent days, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in response to a whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleged Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

Gabbard, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in a crowded field, said on ""Fox & Friends"" that she has been consistent in saying that victory in the 2020 election, not impeachment, is the way for Democrats to make sure Trump leaves office.

SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL

""I believe that impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided. The hyperpartisanship is one of the main things driving our country apart,"" she told host Brian Kilmeade.

Gabbard's comments are in contrast to many of her Democratic colleagues, including Warren, one of the top contenders in the presidential race.

""The House must impeach. It must start today,"" Warren tweeted Tuesday morning.

In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.

Mexico and Canada, not China, are currently our two largest trading partners. For the sake of America’s economy and workers, this deal needs to get done.

The only obstacle is political obstruction by congressional Democrats more intent on depriving President Trump of a win than bestowing one on the American people.

This is politics at its worst, and that’s saying something.

NEWT GINGRICH: DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DOING A GREAT JOB SHOWING VOTERS WHY TRUMP SHOULD BE REELECTED

The United States stands to make immense economic gains from this comprehensive renegotiation of the deeply flawed 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The importance of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is widely recognized on both sides of the political aisle, yet more than nine months after the signing ceremony, it lingers in Congress, unratified, undebated and uncertain.

As a “non-self-executing treaty,” both Houses of Congress have to pass the USMCA before it can take effect. Like all treaties of this magnitude, the deal deserves careful debate. But, given its broad popularity, the process should be much further along by now.

The question isn’t whether the deal is worth making, but rather why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is preventing debate. Various Democratic lawmakers have suggested that they might wish to tweak certain aspects of the agreement, but so far they’ve largely avoided even learning about the details.

The reasons for ratifying the USMCA as quickly as possible are readily apparent. NAFTA was poorly negotiated, typical of an era of very bad trade dealings by American leaders that hurt the people they should protect the most.

Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana — two Republicans from the heartland constituencies hit hardest by NAFTA’s shortcomings — both published very persuasive arguments this past week explaining why the USMCA is so beneficial for the United States.

They point to the higher wages and labor protections that will be, for the first time, imposed on Mexican factories that produce goods for the U.S. market. Many Mexican auto workers, for example, will have to earn at least $16 per hour in order for the cars they make to qualify for tariff-free export to America. That will decrease incentives to offshore American manufacturing jobs and give workers in Detroit a fair chance to compete.

American farmers, meanwhile, will gain easier access to Canadian and Mexican markets — something they’ve been seeking in vain for decades.

But while Trump was the mastermind behind the USMCA, it’s not just Republicans who are convinced of the agreement’s merits, or at least eager to keep the ball moving forward. In July, 14 House Democrats signed a letter to Pelosi urging her to let the House vote on the USMCA before year-end.

We need to replace NAFTA, and Democratic leadership is the only thing standing in the way.

The principles behind this deal are neither partisan nor ideological — getting a better deal for American workers and requiring more robust labor and environmental protections from our trading partners are goals that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have explicitly endorsed, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, even as she rejects the USMCA.

The Warren example sheds a revealing light on Pelosi’s obstructionism. It’s clear as day why Warren is opposing USMCA. She’s running for president against the man whose vision and determination made the deal a reality. Of course, she opposes it.

Warren’s cover story is that she thinks the USMCA is too lenient on pharmaceutical companies, but there’s no evidence the deal would actually raise drug prices for Americans. In any event, the place to bring up such concerns would be during open debate in Congress, where they could be addressed in the final deal, assuming Warren could get enough of her colleagues to share her tongue-in-cheek skepticism.

The same logic is at work with Pelosi. She is stalling, refusing to set a date, and dodging questions about whether it protects workers and the environment — despite the fact the USMCA has the most robust labor and environmental protections of any major trade deal the United States has ever signed.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Like Warren, Pelosi’s opposition is just politics at its worst — and that’s saying something. If Pelosi really believes the protections are insufficient, then she and her allies should suggest modifications, or even pass USMCA and request that the U.S. trade representative work with our partners to improve the deal going forward.

The only reason Democrats are dragging their feet on the USMCA is because they wish to deny Trump a hard-fought win as we approach an election year. That Machiavellian approach is not what America’s economy and workers need right now. We need to replace NAFTA, and the Democratic Party’s leadership is the only thing standing in the way.

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.”



Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves - WaPo: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.”



Moderate Dems join the effort - Fox News: “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.”



Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat - WaPo: “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.”



THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF

“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 72



TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND

Smithsonian: “The guitar Prince plays in [the Purple Rain video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year, John Woodland, the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just a cloud guitar, in other words, it was the cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.”

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA

USA Today: “Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year. Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.”



She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire - Monmouth University: “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate - Politico: “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage. Gabbard will join Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang onstage in October.”



DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate - Fox News: “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.”

Fox News: “A Russian navy boat embarking on a research expedition in the Arctic Sea sunk after being attacked by a female walrus that was defending her young, according to reports Monday. The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The first week, I thought, the terrible thing is that people are going to judge me now by a different standard. If I can just muddle through life, they'll say it was a great achievement, given this. I thought that would be the worst, that would be the greatest defeat in my life -- if I allowed that. I decided if I could make people judge me by the old standard, that would be a triumph and that's what I try to do. It seemed to me the only way to live.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking with the Washington Post on Aug. 17, 1984.

Delaney said the candidates' platforms are moving too far left and will end up scaring away voters who favor private insurance and economic growth.

""Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are fundamentally running on almost like a government takeover of the private economy of the United States of America,"" he said.

""They should ignore the polls and do what they think is right.

""Whether or not there are grounds for impeachment is a different matter. If you believe there are grounds for impeachment, don't look at the polls, don't worry about how it'll affect the election, move forward.""

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN

The push for impeachment has picked up steam in recent days, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in response to a whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleged Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

""The House must impeach. It must start today,"" Warren tweeted Tuesday morning.

In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.

Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget indeed told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on the aid to Ukraine. But administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the freeze was tied to concerns about corruption.

The rapid-fire support for an impeachment investigation by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea."

The Fox News digital politics editor added that although the lower-tier candidates do not command the same voter support as people like former Vice President Joe Biden or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., those voters will still have to shift their support somewhere.

""That's where Biden's opportunity to hold the line is -- to hold on to that share as it comes to him,"" Stirewalt added.

In an MSNBC interview, Booker said he doesn't want to ""stick around"" if he's not ""in this to win it"" -- however adding the last couple days have drawn a windfall in fundraising numbers.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

The Trump administration pushed back Tuesday in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before President Trump pressured the country's leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to Trump's Ukraine discussions.

Democrats have called for the transcript of the phone call to be released. Conway said Trump hopes the contents of the call are made public, but noted the potential ramifications for foreign policy.

Nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters questioned in a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll say they support a government-run single-payer Medicare-for-all style system that would replace existing private insurance. That plan is championed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two progressive standard-bearers in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT MEDICARE BUY-INS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL

But among all voters, support for such a plan plunges to just 41 percent. About 56 percent of registered voters oppose a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance.

The poll, released Sunday, indicates that what two-thirds of all voters do like is allowing a Medicare buy-in for those under 65 years old. That’s in line with the public option being pitched by former Vice President Joe Biden. Currently, the taxpayer-funded program covers Americans 65 and older.

The latest Fox News national poll also points to the popularity of the Medicare buy-in plan, with 83 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they favor the plan, which would allow individuals to buy into the government-run system. Even 51 percent of Republicans agree.

Among all voters, 68 percent support a buy-in system. But support for a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance nosedives to 46 percent among all voters in the Fox News poll, which was released last week. Sen. Kamala Harris of California also supports Medicare-for-all, albeit with a role for private insurers.

Health care has been a leading concern among Democratic primary voters, with the issue topping the past two primary debates.

For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump in July pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment.

But the firestorm, apparently related to a still-secret whistleblower complaint, has, in turn, opened the door for Republicans to revisit the original controversy involving Joe Biden's son Hunter. Further, they allege, the details of that story suggest Biden did the same thing Trump is accused of doing -- leveraging military aid to pressure Ukraine.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

“The more they want to talk about Ukraine, the better,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday morning on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”

Giuliani has long been looking into the Bidens’ ties to Ukraine, claiming Hunter Biden improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioning whether his dad helped protect him.

Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

Trump has claimed Shokin ""was after"" Hunter Biden and the vice president was trying to protect his son.

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether or not he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

Trump allies are hammering that as the real scandal, as video of Biden once bragging about his role in having Shokin fired has gone viral.

BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS

Biden has denied wrongdoing, with Shokin having already been suspected of corruption before his dismissal, and hammered Trump over the reports on his phone conversation with Kiev. For his part, Trump addressed his phone call with Zelensky by calling the conversation “perfect” and insisting “there was no quid pro quo” and that he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Trump also insists that the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine is bogus because he gave the aid.

Trump also tweeted Sunday night, stating that the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Giuliani is also trying to circulate new Biden allegations.

Giuliani accused Kiev on Monday of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden and suggested the Obama administration turned a blind eye.

""If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,” he tweeted. ""Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?""

While the former vice president has claimed he and his son never discussed Hunter’s business, Hunter told The New Yorker that they did talk about it once, with Joe Biden telling his son, ""I hope you know what you are doing.""

Democrats and Republicans are both pushing for investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has shied away from calling for impeachment in the past, told CNN on Sunday that the latest allegations against Trump may warrant such a measure.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,” Schiff said.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint involving Trump to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he wants the Justice Department to look into the Bidens’ dealings with Ukraine.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

“Nobody’s looked at this, but somebody should, so I’m hoping the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,” Graham said. “Was there a relationship between the vice president’s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don’t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I sure as hell don’t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.”

All this comes as Democrats continue to battle for the 2020 presidential nomination. After three debates, Biden remains the front-runner, but he has lost ground to rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with Warren surpassing Biden in a new Iowa poll.

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a massive tax on the wealthiest Americans that aims to diminish income inequality -- a central theme of his campaign -- and at least begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing.

The release of the independent senator from Vermont's ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

“There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders said on Twitter as he urged supporters to read his new plan. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist.""

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sanders has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.

Sanders' plan, if enacted into law, would place a 1 percent tax on net worth over $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million. The proposed Sanders tax would increase to 4 percent net worth from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent for net worth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, and ultimately reach 8 percent for wealth over $10 billion.

The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide, and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.

“Our tax on extreme wealth would only apply to the wealthiest households in America and would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years, which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small, privileged class,” Sanders said in an email to supporters announcing his plan.

And he said that he would “use the revenue to fund our affordable housing plan, universal childcare, and help fund our work to guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman, and child in this country.""

The Republican National Committee criticized Sanders, with spokesman Michael Joyce arguing that “no matter how many new taxes Bernie proposes, it still won’t come even close to covering the costs of Bernie’s socialist pie-in-the-sky policy proposals.”

Warren’s plan – which she unveiled at the beginning of the year-- by comparison would place a 2 percent annual tax on net worth above $50 million and would slap a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion.

Her campaign says it would affect the top 70,000 households in the county and would bring in an estimated $2.6 trillion over 10 years.

The Warren plan Affects the top 70,000 households



Would bring in about $2.6 trillion over 10 years

Sanders, in order “ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax,” is calling for creating a national registry and beefing up third-party reporting requirements, increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring the IRS to perform audits of 30 percent of those in the 1 percent bracket and audits of all billionaires.

He’s also calling for a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and a steeper 60 percent on assets over $1 billion “for all wealthy individuals seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax.”

President Trump’s re-election campaign took aim at Sanders, not specifically over his new plan but for vows by the senator and the rest of the Democratic field to repeal the tax cuts passed in 2017 by the then-GOP controlled Congress and signed into law by the president.

“By repealing President Trump’s tax cuts, Sanders and the rest of the Democrats would raise taxes on almost all Americans, not just the very rich,” campaign spokesperson Erin Perrine said."

""Look at the way Trump did it... when he wasn't on top of the polls he would show up with a couple tweets -- I remember he showed up in Las Vegas with like 25,000 people showing up and you don't see that organically on the Democratic side.

Former President Jimmy Carter, 95, also weighed in on the issue, saying he couldn't have handled the presidency at 80 years old during his term as the 39th U.S. president from 1977 until 1981, when he was in his 50s.

BRIT HUME CALLS BIDEN'S CONDITION 'WORRISOME'

Speaking during his annual report at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Ga., last week, Carter said he hopes ""there's an age limit"" to serving in one of the most powerful positions in the world.

“If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president,"" he told the crowd.

The September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows that 69 percent of voters dislike Trump. That is a toxic level in any race let alone one for the presidency.

It is impossible to improve that sentiment to less than 50 percent in the remaining 14 months before the 2020 election. Prior to this poll, the highest dislike of a president was 42 percent for George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in March 2006.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: WHAT IS TRUMP-BIDEN CLASH OVER UKRAINE AND WHISTLEBLOWER ALL ABOUT?

In the same poll, 49 percent say they’re very uncomfortable with Trump’s 2020 candidacy. That’s compared with 41 percent for Bernie Sanders and 33 percent apiece for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Furthermore, a record 50 percent dislike Trump and his policies.

Other polls show Trump losing a general election to any of the top five Democratic candidates for president.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why Trump allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the front-runner in the crowded Democratic primary field. That should concern every American.

It has been widely reported that Trump asked the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, eight times in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, while vice president, acted improperly in pressuring the resignation of a Ukraine prosecutor whose office was investigating a company that employed Biden's son. Trump denies these allegations and the Ukrainian foreign minister said Saturday, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.”

It was also reported that Trump threatened to withhold $250 million in military aid from Ukraine if they didn’t cooperate. That money was released this month.

Furthermore, Trump insisted that Ukraine work on the matter with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, not official representatives of the U.S. government.

However, if these reports are true, a request to benefit Trump’s political prospects, rather than United States or its national security, is illegal.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why he allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner.

Trump's acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to discuss the complaint that brought this matter to light when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee last week and refused to provide the whistleblower complaint to Congress … which they are legally entitled to receive.

In addition to allegedly seeking assistance from a foreign government to interfere in our election,Trump has done nothing to secure our election systems.

In June, the House passed the Secure Election Act, which authorized $600 million for states to bolster election systems. The act would require the implementation of cybersecurity safeguards for hardware and software used in elections, bar wireless communication devices in election systems, and require electronic voting machines be manufactured in the United States.

However, the Senate had not taken up the measure because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was refusing to do so. Until last week. Out of the blue, just one day after the Ukraine story broke, McConnell approved $250 million for election security, a token amount that will provide only $5 million per state to fight the Russians and will have little real effect.

It seems McConnell, who takes umbrage with his nickname “Moscow Mitch,"" may have been trying to head off criticism about foreign election interference with this gesture. But it is just that, a gesture. There are 406 days until next year's general election – and only 133 until the 2020 caucuses and primaries begin – and the resources and reforms to guard against foreign interference are not close to what is needed.

It appears Trump is so worried about his poll numbers that he thinks he needs outside help to win and that no one can or will stop him … again.

If that is true, then Trump is acting in a decidedly un-American fashion.

He should be held accountable. Every member of Congress and every American should stand up to Trump and for the rule of law.

That is the American way.

But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of White House contenders still standing after October’s debate.

The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates.

OCTOBER DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE TO BE HELD IN OHIO

But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar.

The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.

""Qualification period ends 1 week (not 2 weeks) before the debate, giving candidates more time to qualify,"" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa tweeted.

The other threshold – fundraising – also saw a slight raising of the bar. To make the cut, candidates will have to receive campaign contributions from 165,000 individual donors. That’s up from 130,000 for the September and October debates and from 65,000 for the first two rounds of showdowns. Candidates also will have to receive 600 unique contributions from each of 20 states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories.

The DNC’s faced criticism over its thresholds for months from many of the lower and middle-tier candidates, who argued that the criteria forced them to concentrate on boosting donor contributions at the expense of retail politicking in the early voting states. And, some activists and party leaders in the early voting states have also criticized the DNC for winnowing the record field of candidates – which topped off at roughly two-dozen contenders this summer – before voters actually got to vote in the primaries and caucuses starting this coming February.

""The DNC is using polling to winnow the field even further, when it's voters and caucus-goers who should be determining our nominee,"" said Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's presidential campaign.

And, Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, told Fox News that ""as the DNC continues to make the rules up as they go along, Governor Bullock will remain focused on bringing his message of a fair shot for every American directly to voters on the ground.""

Both Bennet and Bullock were on the debate stage in July for the third round but failed to qualify for this month's showdown and it appears unlikely either will make the cut for October's debate.

The new thresholds shouldn’t be much of a problem for many of the leading contenders – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

2020 DEMOCRATS FUME AT DNC OVER DEBATE THRESHOLDS

Some of the other six candidates likely to make the October debate are not sure bets to qualify for November’s showdown. That group consists of Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

As he has in the past, Yang praised the DNC, tweeting, ""Kudos to the DNC for raising the thresholds in a fair and transparent manner as well.""

Some of the candidates, including Booker and Buttigieg, quickly used news of the new thresholds to reach out to supporters with fundraising emails.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer – who've also made the cut for October’s showdown – have yet to hit 3 percent in any polls since the November qualifying period kicked off earlier this month. And, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who's just one poll away from making the October debate, also has yet to reach 3 percent in any approved surveys.

A new qualifying poll – a Monmouth University survey in New Hampshire – is set for release on Tuesday."
49,Maxim Lott,Beto O'Rourke’s hard-left turn on gun confiscation in the Democratic presidential primary may play well with liberal primary voters across the country – but the former congressman could also be hurting his political future in Texas should he someday choose to… [+5234 chars],Beto O'Rourke’s hard-left turn on gun confiscation in the Democratic presidential primary may play well with liberal primary voters across the country – but the former congressman could also be hurting his political future in Texas should he someday choose to…,2019-09-23,Fox News,Beto O’Rourke’s gun confiscation rhetoric could doom political future in Texas,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/beto-orourkes-gun-rhetoric-could-doom-political-future-in-texas,"Beto O'Rourke’s hard-left turn on gun confiscation in the Democratic presidential primary may play well with liberal primary voters across the country – but the former congressman could also be hurting his political future in Texas should he someday choose to run statewide again.

O’Rourke, who nearly won a Senate seat in Texas in 2018 against incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, declared in a primary debate earlier this month, ""Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15.""

That’s in contrast to what O’Rourke’s said in the 2018 race, when the Democrat sought to appeal to the gun-friendly state by repeatedly telling Texans, ""If you own an AR-15, keep it."" (He also said during that race that he didn’t want more such weapons sold.)

WOMAN WHO CONFRONTED O'ROURKE ON GUN CONFISCATION PLANS: 'SHAME ON HIM' FOR EXPLOITING 'OUR TRAGEDIES'

In the wake of multiple recent mass shootings, including in his hometown of El Paso, O'Rourke has proposed forcing AR-15 owners to turn in their guns through a mandatory buyback program.

The NRA says that Americans own over 15 million AR-15s, and that they are the most popular rifle in America for training and home defense.

O'Rourke's campaign is now selling T-shirts featuring his ""hell yes"" gun confiscation slogan.

Cruz mocked O'Rourke's shift last week, noting that in 2018 he warned that O'Rourke wanted to ""take our guns,” yet fact-checker PolitiFact rated that claim “false.”

""PolitiFact — you non-partisan sexy thing you — so ... did you buy Beto’s shirt?"" Cruz joked on Twitter.

Texas political activists assert that O’Rourke can't win in Texas anymore with these positions.

“O'Rourke's ‘hell yes’ to gun confiscation demonstrates how little he knows about Texans and rifles,” said JoAnn Fleming, the executive director of Grassroots America, We the People PAC, a conservative group in Texas. “By shooting off his mouth, Beto managed to end his political career in Texas, while driving up rifle sales.”

O’Rourke’s rhetoric on guns has not picked up much support from his former colleagues in Congress. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who is negotiating with Senate Republicans on expanding background checks and possibly creating “red flag” laws, pushed back on the mandatory buyback idea.

""I don't know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O'Rourke,"" Schumer told reporters from upstate New York, according to the Times Union.

But O’Rourke hit back at Schumer in a fundraising email, pointing out that most Democrats nationally agree with him.

“With respect to the minority leader, a recent Monmouth University poll found that nearly 70 percent of Democrats support Beto’s mandatory buyback of assault weapons,” O’Rourke’s fundraising email said.

O'Rourke entered the Democratic race to great fanfare this year, but has struggled in the polls. Some Democrats have suggested he set his sights on a 2020 bid for the Senate, and not the White House.

Even some liberal writers have acknowledged that O’Rourke’s gun policies could hurt him in Texas.

“Beto is no longer a viable candidate for the Senate in Texas, thanks to his gun confiscation comment,” German Lopez, a writer for Vox, wrote on Twitter.

For his part, O’Rourke has been adamant that he no longer wants a Texas Senate seat, despite past pressure from some Texas Democrats and news outlets to drop his long-shot presidential bid and compete for Republican Sen. John Cornyn's seat instead.

“There have even been some who have suggested that I stay in Texas and run for Senate,” O’Rourke said in an August speech. “But that would not be good enough for this community. That would not be good enough for El Paso. That would not be good enough for this country.""

Cornyn joined the pile-on against O’Rourke’s shifting positions last week, highlighting another new O'Rourke proposal on marijuana.

O’ROURKE CALLS FOR LEGALIZING MARIJUANA, RELEASING NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS

“Say it ain’t so, Beto. First, grab guns of law abiding citizens and now legalize marijuana?” Cornyn tweeted.

However, polling indicates that a slight majority of Texans in fact support legalizing some quantity of marijuana. But O’Rourke would go further than legalization, proposing taxing marijuana to fund “justice grants” for people who were convicted for marijuana possession in the past.

O’Rourke has also come out for impeaching President Trump.

“Polls consistently show that an overwhelming majority of Texans do not support the impeachment of President Trump,” Fleming noted.

A Quinnipiac poll found that 60 percent of Texans say Congress should not try to impeach, while only 34 percent support it.

O’Rourke’s leftward shift has not been getting him traction in the polls yet. In polling averages, he gets just about 3 percent nationally.

“His far-left stance will continue to generate attention and secure him a spot on the cable news circuit. But it's not a governing philosophy, nor a winning campaign one,” Texas-based economist and political consultant Abby McCloskey told Fox News.

“The far-left ground in the 2020 presidential campaign is better covered by [Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth] Warren, who clearly has thought through her proposals in detail,” McCloskey added.

Fleming added: “His wild swing to gun confiscation appears to be an admission he won't ever run for office in Texas again.”

If you did, hold on to those memories. It might be the last relaxing moment you'll have for a while. We're about to wreck your peace of mind.

It turns out that all is not well on this blue planet of ours, far from it. Indeed, it appears that the Earth itself is facing what we're going to call tonight, an existential threat from climate change.

Now, what does the term ""existential threat"" actually mean, you ask? Honestly, we don't know. But it sounds absolutely terrifying.

CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS SNARL DC TRAFFIC AS BIZARRE SCENES UNFOLD IN CAPITAL

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., presidential candidate: The climate change is real. It is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., presidential candidate: If NATO is about the common defense, the biggest existential threat is climate change.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, presidential candidate: This is climate change. It really is the existential threat.

Julian Castro, presidential candidate: We're going to have to address the most existential threat to our nation and the world, climate change.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Beto O'Rourke, presidential candidate: On climate change, the greatest existential threat that we face.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., presidential candidate: We are facing a climate crisis, it represents an existential threat to who we are as human beings.

""A threat to who we are as humans."" Well, there are a number of questions here. Let's see if we can unpack them.

The first one: is climate change real? That's an easy one. Of course, it's real. Climate always changes.

If you're in the United States, for example, the ground that you're standing on right now was not so long ago really covered with glacial ice a mile thick. Now, it's not covered in glacial ice a mile thick. So what happened?

What happened is climate change. That's been happening since the Earth cooled. Is human activity accelerating climate change? Can we reverse or slow climate change? Despite what they tell you, no one really knows.

But the real question here has nothing to do with climate science. It has to do with people who pretend they understand climate science. Do those people actually believe what they're saying?

This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets.

Well, let's see. Here was Kamala Harris recently talking at a CNN town hall about how red meat contributes to the absolutely existential threat of climate change.

Harris: As a nation, we have actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating, because we have a problem in America.

Erin Burnett, CNN host: But would you support changing the Dietary Guidelines?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: You know, the food pyramid, what people are eating?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: So reduce red meat specifically.

Harris: Yes, I would.

Got that? Kamala Harris is a good person, and because she is a good person -- a much better person than you are -- she cares about the existential threat of climate change so much, that she is willing to forgo red meat. That's what she told CNN viewers recently.

But when she is in the pork producing state of Iowa, though, it's a very different story. Just this past weekend, Harris attended the Annual Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry. She took her turn working the grill posing for the cameras.

And by the way, so did all of the other Democratic candidates. Liz Warren was there, Beto O'Rourke, even Cory Booker, who says he is a vegan. Organizers grilled more than 10,000 steaks over the weekend. Tape of the event shows plumes of ozone destroying meat smoke rising heavenward. The candidates standing amidst all of this seemed wholly unconcerned.

Are you surprised? Don't be surprised. This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. No one says a word about it.

Last week, millions of concerned progressives took part in the so-called climate strike. In their wake, they left mountains of litter. On Monday in Washington, climate activists demanded change by blocking roads, causing gridlock, and throwing confetti on the ground.

Well, if you're under 40, you might be surprised to learn that people didn't use to express concern about the environment by littering. That used to seem weird, but then the point of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving it and protecting it.

The point now is very different. The point now is political power. You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submit to your will, or else. And as you do that, of course, you don't need to fight fair or acknowledge democracy or make a rational case for your position. You do whatever it takes. You'll even use children, if it helps.

Just today, for example, a 16-year-old Swedish girl named Greta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists. Here's part of what she said:

Thunberg, climate change activist: This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words.

We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.

You stole my childhood? Do what I want you to do, or else you're evil?

How do you respond to statements like that? The truth is you can't respond. And of course, that's the point.

When you use children to demand power, they become a kind of human shield. You can hide safely behind them, no one can criticize you.

But who would do something that unscrupulous? Anyone who would do that is someone who would literally do anything to seize control. And that's exactly what they're doing.

The Monmouth University survey, released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont fading to a distant third.

WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.

Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey.

Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.

New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren.

The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday.

“Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray.

The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent.

According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll.

The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates.

The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend. A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.

“It is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux,” Murray noted."

Elizabeth Warren is making a major television and digital ad buy to spread her message to potential primary voters.

Warren’s presidential campaign announced on Tuesday that the populist Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who’s released one progressive policy proposal after another through the primary campaign, will spend eight figures – or at least $10 million – to place spots on TV and on-line in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Those are the first four states to vote on the primary and caucus calendar.

WARREN SURGING IN NEW 2020 POLLS IN NH, NEVADA, IOWA

“Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,” Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in an email to supporters.

Lau explained that spots “will be more digital than old-school broadcast television, and we have built an in-house staff to produce videos and ads rather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns (and the big commissions and fees that come along with it).”

The Warren campaign confirmed to Fox News that the digital ads would start running immediately, and that they’re currently reserving time for the TV commercials. Officials said the buy would last for several months.

The Warren campaign released three of the ads on Tuesday – 15-second, 30-second and one-minute spots.

“Take any of our big problems – health care, climate change, gun violence. Corruption is at the root of why our government won’t act,” Warren says in the 15-second ad. “I know what’s wrong. I know how to fix it. And I’ll fight to get it done.”

SANDERS UPS THE ANTE WITH WEALTH TAX HIGHER THAN WARREN'S PLAN

Lau also announced the campaign is continuing to expand its staffing. While Warren already has a formidable team in the four early-voting states, Lau spoke of ""hiring state directors and organizers in a number of states that have primaries and caucuses in March. And we're targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020.”

The $10 million ad buy and the expansion of campaign staff suggest that Warren’s fundraising remains strong. After a slow start earlier in the year, the senator hauled in over $19 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising."

""Do you know who's having the best day today? Elizabeth Warren -- because Joe Biden is involved in this, her poll numbers are rising, it just came out that she's now officially first in New Hampshire ... this is the best political day for her,"" McCain said on Wednesday.

Her comments came as Biden faced renewed scrutiny and many observers speculated that the Democratic primary season was narrowing down to a race between himself and Warren. A Monmouth poll released on Tuesday showed Warren leading Biden in New Hampshire, the first primary state of 2020.

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER - BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

On Wednesday, Trump released a transcript of a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in which the two discussed investigating Biden over corruption allegations.

Biden, who has been the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, attracted scrutiny for pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating a natural gas firm where his son, Hunter, served on the board of directors.

Republicans have used the opportunity to turn the tables on Biden, claiming that the Ukraine controversy highlighted how Biden abused his power while in office.

Warren also seemed to benefit from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to impeach Trump, something Pelosi, D-Calif., announced on Tuesday despite previous calls from Warren and others.

Pelosi resisted calls for impeachment surrounding the Russia investigation but seemed to face a tipping point after news surfaced about Trump's call with Zelensky. The speaker decried Trump's conduct while also accusing his administration of breaking the law by trying to suppress a whistleblower report on the president's comments.

Warren, on Saturday, was just one of many to pressure Pelosi after the initial news surfaced and before the speaker announced impeachment proceedings.

""Congress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” Warren said, apparently knocking Pelosi's previous reluctance on the issue."

Bernie Sanders sinks to a distant third in a number of new national and early voting state polls, top members of his presidential campaign are taking aim at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- the other progressive superstar in the Democratic nomination race who’s soared ahead of Sanders in the surveys.

The swipes signal what could be a newly aggressive phase for the Vermont senator's campaign, with a hitherto ""truce"" between him and Warren beginning to crack as his polling numbers suffer. One progressive strategist with ties to the independent senator’s campaign said that when it comes to negating Warren’s surge in the polls, the Sanders team has been “flailing around.”

WARREN SURGES IN LATEST POLLS, TIES BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT; SANDERS SLIPS TO DISTANT THIRD

Sanders and Warren met last December before they launched their presidential bids and agreed to not criticize each other while on the campaign trail. That non-aggression-style pact has largely held – with both teaming up at recent presidential debates to defend their ""Medicare-for-all"" proposals.

And both had refrained from attacking each other.

“Bernie and I have been friends for many, many years. Long before I ever got into politics. And I don’t see any reason that that should change,” Warren told reporters recently after being asked if she was going to start painting contrasts with Sanders.

Sanders – who’s making his second straight White House run – has repeatedly said when asked about Warren that “Elizabeth is a friend of mine” and noting that the two “have been friends for over 20 years.”

But that’s apparently not stopping some leading members of Sanders' team from taking aim at Warren.

The Sanders campaign’s national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray recently criticized Warren on Twitter for failing to support Sanders’ national rent control proposal. Warren has said she doesn’t think such a policy would be realistic across the country. Gray used Warren’s viral zinger from the July debate in targeting the senator from Massachusetts.

Gray also jabbed at Warren over her campaign's lack of a collective bargaining agreement with her staff since recognizing her campaign workers’ union in June.

Sanders also faced a bit of criticism as he met the demands from his own unionized campaign staff.

In another case, senior Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels took aim at Warren’s climate change plan. As Vox noted, Gunnels retweeted a tweet from a New York City councilman saying that Warren had “missed the mark.”

As they were battling for second place in the polls most of the summer, the Sanders campaign repeatedly insisted that former Vice President Joe Biden was the main target. The former vice president was the clear front-runner in nearly all polling from his entry into the race in late April until recent days, when a slew of new surveys suggested that Warren had tied Biden for the top spot.

WARREN LANDS BACKING OF PROGRESSIVE GROUP THAT ENDORSED SANDERS IN HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID

While Sanders kept his focus on Biden, Warren surged in polling and, in a well-publicized moment, she landed the endorsement of the progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid. Meanwhile, Sanders in recent weeks has replaced a couple of key staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar.

“They thought their opponent was Biden because they thought he was the next Hillary Clinton,” noted the progressive strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.

The strategist argued that the Sanders campaign failed to realize that Warren was the real threat, spotlighting that “their strategy was wrong. They were looking at Biden as the main opponent when it was really Warren.”"

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Warren – the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another – stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with the former vice president commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Sanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month.

""After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. ""We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind.""

Going beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way.""

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Many political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar.

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent.

A couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

And in Iowa, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

The release of the surveys come as Warren’s campaign on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary.

WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES

The release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics.

Warren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”

The pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

The push for impeachment has picked up steam in recent days, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in response to a whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleged Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

Gabbard, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in a crowded field, said on ""Fox & Friends"" that she has been consistent in saying that victory in the 2020 election, not impeachment, is the way for Democrats to make sure Trump leaves office.

SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL

""I believe that impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided. The hyperpartisanship is one of the main things driving our country apart,"" she told host Brian Kilmeade.

Gabbard's comments are in contrast to many of her Democratic colleagues, including Warren, one of the top contenders in the presidential race.

""The House must impeach. It must start today,"" Warren tweeted Tuesday morning.

In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.

This is politics at its worst, and that’s saying something.

NEWT GINGRICH: DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DOING A GREAT JOB SHOWING VOTERS WHY TRUMP SHOULD BE REELECTED

The United States stands to make immense economic gains from this comprehensive renegotiation of the deeply flawed 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The importance of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is widely recognized on both sides of the political aisle, yet more than nine months after the signing ceremony, it lingers in Congress, unratified, undebated and uncertain.

As a “non-self-executing treaty,” both Houses of Congress have to pass the USMCA before it can take effect. Like all treaties of this magnitude, the deal deserves careful debate. But, given its broad popularity, the process should be much further along by now.

The question isn’t whether the deal is worth making, but rather why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is preventing debate. Various Democratic lawmakers have suggested that they might wish to tweak certain aspects of the agreement, but so far they’ve largely avoided even learning about the details.

The reasons for ratifying the USMCA as quickly as possible are readily apparent. NAFTA was poorly negotiated, typical of an era of very bad trade dealings by American leaders that hurt the people they should protect the most.

Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana — two Republicans from the heartland constituencies hit hardest by NAFTA’s shortcomings — both published very persuasive arguments this past week explaining why the USMCA is so beneficial for the United States.

They point to the higher wages and labor protections that will be, for the first time, imposed on Mexican factories that produce goods for the U.S. market. Many Mexican auto workers, for example, will have to earn at least $16 per hour in order for the cars they make to qualify for tariff-free export to America. That will decrease incentives to offshore American manufacturing jobs and give workers in Detroit a fair chance to compete.

American farmers, meanwhile, will gain easier access to Canadian and Mexican markets — something they’ve been seeking in vain for decades.

But while Trump was the mastermind behind the USMCA, it’s not just Republicans who are convinced of the agreement’s merits, or at least eager to keep the ball moving forward. In July, 14 House Democrats signed a letter to Pelosi urging her to let the House vote on the USMCA before year-end.

We need to replace NAFTA, and Democratic leadership is the only thing standing in the way.

The principles behind this deal are neither partisan nor ideological — getting a better deal for American workers and requiring more robust labor and environmental protections from our trading partners are goals that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have explicitly endorsed, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, even as she rejects the USMCA.

The Warren example sheds a revealing light on Pelosi’s obstructionism. It’s clear as day why Warren is opposing USMCA. She’s running for president against the man whose vision and determination made the deal a reality. Of course, she opposes it.

Warren’s cover story is that she thinks the USMCA is too lenient on pharmaceutical companies, but there’s no evidence the deal would actually raise drug prices for Americans. In any event, the place to bring up such concerns would be during open debate in Congress, where they could be addressed in the final deal, assuming Warren could get enough of her colleagues to share her tongue-in-cheek skepticism.

The same logic is at work with Pelosi. She is stalling, refusing to set a date, and dodging questions about whether it protects workers and the environment — despite the fact the USMCA has the most robust labor and environmental protections of any major trade deal the United States has ever signed.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Like Warren, Pelosi’s opposition is just politics at its worst — and that’s saying something. If Pelosi really believes the protections are insufficient, then she and her allies should suggest modifications, or even pass USMCA and request that the U.S. trade representative work with our partners to improve the deal going forward.

The only reason Democrats are dragging their feet on the USMCA is because they wish to deny Trump a hard-fought win as we approach an election year. That Machiavellian approach is not what America’s economy and workers need right now. We need to replace NAFTA, and the Democratic Party’s leadership is the only thing standing in the way.

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.”



Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves - WaPo: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.”



Moderate Dems join the effort - Fox News: “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.”



Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat - WaPo: “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.”



THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF

“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 72



TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND

Smithsonian: “The guitar Prince plays in [the Purple Rain video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year, John Woodland, the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just a cloud guitar, in other words, it was the cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.”

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA

USA Today: “Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year. Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.”



She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire - Monmouth University: “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate - Politico: “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage. Gabbard will join Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang onstage in October.”



DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate - Fox News: “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.”

Fox News: “A Russian navy boat embarking on a research expedition in the Arctic Sea sunk after being attacked by a female walrus that was defending her young, according to reports Monday. The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.”

“The first week, I thought, the terrible thing is that people are going to judge me now by a different standard. If I can just muddle through life, they'll say it was a great achievement, given this. I thought that would be the worst, that would be the greatest defeat in my life -- if I allowed that. I decided if I could make people judge me by the old standard, that would be a triumph and that's what I try to do. It seemed to me the only way to live.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking with the Washington Post on Aug. 17, 1984.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was set to meet Tuesday with fellow House Democrats to discuss whether to move forward with an impeachment inquiry in the wake of the Ukrainian whistleblower controversy.

Wisenberg said if Democrats believe Trump has crossed the line, then questions about the potential political fallout must take a backseat.

SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL

""They should ignore the polls and do what they think is right. Impeachment is a solemn matter to be deliberated upon and I think they've been looking at the polls too much,"" the former independent counsel said. ""Whether or not there are grounds for impeachment is a different matter. If you believe there are grounds for impeachment, don't look at the polls, don't worry about how it'll affect the election, move forward.""

Wisenberg said he would give the same advice to either party and is not advocating that impeachment would be the right course of action in this instance.

""[Impeachment] is not an easy task in the best of circumstances and I don't think they're gonna have an easy road of it, but my God, they should try to do the right thing,"" he said.

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN

The push for impeachment has picked up steam in recent days, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in response to a whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleged Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

""The House must impeach. It must start today,"" Warren tweeted Tuesday morning.

In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.

GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget indeed told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on the aid to Ukraine. But administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the freeze was tied to concerns about corruption.

The rapid-fire support for an impeachment investigation by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea."

BIDEN HITS THE SKIDS IN NEW Q POLL

Politico: “A new national survey shows Elizabeth Warren now sitting atop the 2020 Democratic field… Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.”



Trump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters - NYT: “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.”



Warren ready for air war with $10 million buy - Politico: “Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.”



Buttigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy - CBS News: “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator John McCain's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President Barack Obama, Justin Timberlake and Tom Hanks, is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’”



Sanders touts dozen of union member endorsements - The Hill: “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.”

TIME OUT: WELL PACKAGED PEANUTS

New Yorker: “Timing is the life force of comics. Without a sensitivity to the rhythms and the music—a.k.a. the reality—of life, a comic strip will arrive D.O.A., nothing more than a bunch of dumb pictures. … The reader doesn’t just look at Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy but reads them as musical notes in a silently heard composition of hilarity, cruelty, and occasional melancholy. In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver. The strip was created out of four equally sized panels, which allowed it to run horizontally, vertically, or stacked two by two. … Who would’ve thought that such a hard-nosed commercial decision would catalyze one of the greatest works of popular art of the twentieth century?”

TRUMP LEANED ON UKRAINIAN LEADER FOR BIDEN DIRT

WSJ: “President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to ‘look into’ former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and said he would direct his personal lawyer and attorney general to reach out to Mr. Zelensky to ‘get to the bottom of it,’ according to a document released by the White House designed to memorialize a July phone call between the leaders. The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.”



Trump lawyer: State Department directed involvement - WashEx: “President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.”



Pelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.”



Poll shows reason for her caution - WaPo: “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”



Silver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? - FiveThirtyEight: “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas. Kris Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” – James Belany, Pittsburgh



[Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans.]

Chortle if you will at my Cubbies misfortune -- but just wait until next year!” – Stephen J. Tock, Dwight, Ill.

And we can all be proud to say that the National League Central continues to be the best, most competitive division in baseball.

AP: “A veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics to a camel owned by a Louisiana truck stop petting zoo after a woman bit the 600-pound (272-kilogram) animal to free herself from under its weight. Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office documents obtained by The Advocate on Monday accuse Florida couple Gloria and Edmond Lancaster of throwing treats for their unleashed dog into Caspar the camel's enclosure at Tiger Truck Stop. The couple told deputies the camel attacked the dog, but the sheriff's office said the couple had provoked the animal before it sat on Gloria Lancaster. She'd crawled under barbed wire to retrieve her pet. Gloria Lancaster told officers she had to bite the camel to free herself. Truck stop manager Pamela Bossier said a veterinarian prescribed Caspar antibiotics as a precaution.”

CORY BOOKER MEMO WARNS CANDIDATE MAY NOT BE IN RACE 'MUCH LONGER' WITHOUT FUNDRAISING BOOST

The Fox News digital politics editor added that although the lower-tier candidates do not command the same voter support as people like former Vice President Joe Biden or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., those voters will still have to shift their support somewhere.

""That's where Biden's opportunity to hold the line is -- to hold on to that share as it comes to him,"" Stirewalt added.

In an MSNBC interview, Booker said he doesn't want to ""stick around"" if he's not ""in this to win it"" -- however adding the last couple days have drawn a windfall in fundraising numbers.

In Demissie's memo, the campaign warned Booker must raise $1.7 million by the end of the third fundraising quarter in order to have a likely path to the nomination.

The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

The Trump administration pushed back Tuesday in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before President Trump pressured the country's leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to Trump's Ukraine discussions.

Democrats have called for the transcript of the phone call to be released. Conway said Trump hopes the contents of the call are made public, but noted the potential ramifications for foreign policy.

""You don’t want to have a chilling effect on other leaders wanting to speak with the president. But you saw him yesterday. He said, 'I hope you will learn what’s in there. It was a perfect call,'"" she responded.

The release of the independent senator from Vermont's ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

“There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders said on Twitter as he urged supporters to read his new plan. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist.""

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sanders has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.

Sanders' plan, if enacted into law, would place a 1 percent tax on net worth over $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million. The proposed Sanders tax would increase to 4 percent net worth from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent for net worth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, and ultimately reach 8 percent for wealth over $10 billion.

The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide, and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.

“Our tax on extreme wealth would only apply to the wealthiest households in America and would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years, which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small, privileged class,” Sanders said in an email to supporters announcing his plan.

And he said that he would “use the revenue to fund our affordable housing plan, universal childcare, and help fund our work to guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman, and child in this country.""

The Republican National Committee criticized Sanders, with spokesman Michael Joyce arguing that “no matter how many new taxes Bernie proposes, it still won’t come even close to covering the costs of Bernie’s socialist pie-in-the-sky policy proposals.”

Warren’s plan – which she unveiled at the beginning of the year-- by comparison would place a 2 percent annual tax on net worth above $50 million and would slap a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion.

Her campaign says it would affect the top 70,000 households in the county and would bring in an estimated $2.6 trillion over 10 years.

The Warren plan Affects the top 70,000 households



Would bring in about $2.6 trillion over 10 years

Sanders, in order “ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax,” is calling for creating a national registry and beefing up third-party reporting requirements, increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring the IRS to perform audits of 30 percent of those in the 1 percent bracket and audits of all billionaires.

He’s also calling for a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and a steeper 60 percent on assets over $1 billion “for all wealthy individuals seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax.”

President Trump’s re-election campaign took aim at Sanders, not specifically over his new plan but for vows by the senator and the rest of the Democratic field to repeal the tax cuts passed in 2017 by the then-GOP controlled Congress and signed into law by the president.

“By repealing President Trump’s tax cuts, Sanders and the rest of the Democrats would raise taxes on almost all Americans, not just the very rich,” campaign spokesperson Erin Perrine said."

""I think we're going to see a gradual dissipation in energy by the Biden campaign until he is finally overtaken,"" York continued, saying ""the bigger issue is that Biden is a figure from the past.""

York was joined by Fox News contributor and former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz R-Ut., who echoed his critique of the former vice president.

BIDEN GAFFES, FITNESS FOR OFFICE COME UNDER FIRE IN NEW TRUMP CAMPAIGN VIDEO

""I've just never met anyone that said 'Please, Joe Biden, I want him to be president', and there's an enthusiasm gap that he suffers from. He just can't get people to a Biden rally,"" he said contrasting Biden's rally turnout to President Trump's significantly larger campaign crowds in 2016.

""Look at the way Trump did it... when he wasn't on top of the polls he would show up with a couple tweets -- I remember he showed up in Las Vegas with like 25,000 people showing up and you don't see that organically on the Democratic side. You see it a little bit with Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren has one to two rallies, but not to the degree that Donald Trump does,"" he continued.

JIMMY CARTER SAYS HE HOPES 'THERE'S AN AGE LIMIT FOR PRESIDENCY' IN APPARENT JAB AT BIDEN, SANDERS

Biden’s been largely brushing off criticism that he’s too old for the Oval Office. Earlier this month, he told reporters he’ll prove his fitness through the grinding process that is the presidential campaign trail, and pledged to release his medical records when he gets his ""next physical” before the voting begins next February in the Iowa caucuses.

Former President Jimmy Carter, 95, also weighed in on the issue, saying he couldn't have handled the presidency at 80 years old during his term as the 39th U.S. president from 1977 until 1981, when he was in his 50s.

BRIT HUME CALLS BIDEN'S CONDITION 'WORRISOME'

Speaking during his annual report at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Ga., last week, Carter said he hopes ""there's an age limit"" to serving in one of the most powerful positions in the world.

“If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president,"" he told the crowd.

But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of White House contenders still standing after October’s debate.

The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates.

OCTOBER DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE TO BE HELD IN OHIO

But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar.

The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.

""Qualification period ends 1 week (not 2 weeks) before the debate, giving candidates more time to qualify,"" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa tweeted.

The other threshold – fundraising – also saw a slight raising of the bar. To make the cut, candidates will have to receive campaign contributions from 165,000 individual donors. That’s up from 130,000 for the September and October debates and from 65,000 for the first two rounds of showdowns. Candidates also will have to receive 600 unique contributions from each of 20 states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories.

The DNC’s faced criticism over its thresholds for months from many of the lower and middle-tier candidates, who argued that the criteria forced them to concentrate on boosting donor contributions at the expense of retail politicking in the early voting states. And, some activists and party leaders in the early voting states have also criticized the DNC for winnowing the record field of candidates – which topped off at roughly two-dozen contenders this summer – before voters actually got to vote in the primaries and caucuses starting this coming February.

""The DNC is using polling to winnow the field even further, when it's voters and caucus-goers who should be determining our nominee,"" said Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's presidential campaign.

And, Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, told Fox News that ""as the DNC continues to make the rules up as they go along, Governor Bullock will remain focused on bringing his message of a fair shot for every American directly to voters on the ground.""

Both Bennet and Bullock were on the debate stage in July for the third round but failed to qualify for this month's showdown and it appears unlikely either will make the cut for October's debate.

The new thresholds shouldn’t be much of a problem for many of the leading contenders – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

2020 DEMOCRATS FUME AT DNC OVER DEBATE THRESHOLDS

Some of the other six candidates likely to make the October debate are not sure bets to qualify for November’s showdown. That group consists of Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

As he has in the past, Yang praised the DNC, tweeting, ""Kudos to the DNC for raising the thresholds in a fair and transparent manner as well.""

Some of the candidates, including Booker and Buttigieg, quickly used news of the new thresholds to reach out to supporters with fundraising emails.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer – who've also made the cut for October’s showdown – have yet to hit 3 percent in any polls since the November qualifying period kicked off earlier this month. And, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who's just one poll away from making the October debate, also has yet to reach 3 percent in any approved surveys.

Pelosi made the announcement following a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol, saying that ""the president must be held accountable"" for what she called the ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

The only Democratic hopeful to explicitly come out against impeachment was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business' “Kennedy” on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very ""divisive"" for a country that is already divided.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

“Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,” tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “I agree with @SpeakerPelosi— no one is above the law. He must be impeached.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Special Counsel Robert Mueller spoke publicly about the findings of his Russia investigation, tweeted on Tuesday evening, “In 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.""

Mueller’s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Booker added, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry—it’s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.”

Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.”

Following Pelosi’s announcement, Biden tweeted, “Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.”

Earlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump’s alleged actions “an abuse of power.”

“They undermine our national security,” Biden tweeted. “They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: ""Billionaires should not be able to control our political system.""

During a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, “If you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.”

In a statement, former Texas rep. Beto O’Rourke said he is “grateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump” and called her announcement “a defining moment for our country.”

“For more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in Texas, I have been clear that I support impeachment,” O’Rourke said. “We all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted on Tuesday, “Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.”

Yang added: “Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.”

In a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, “A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.”

He added that he still agrees that moving forward “is for the best,” saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation “that may unearth new details.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., tweeted simply, “The House did the right thing.”

Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi’s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that “she deserves our support.”

""The President’s behavior, combined with the administration’s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,"" Delaney added. ""Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement ""an overdue but important step.”

""Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,"" she said. ""The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.”

Billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump’s alleged criminal behavior.

“Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what’s right, not what’s politically convenient,” Steyer said. “We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.”

Earlier this month, Steyer told Fox News' Bret Baier during an interview on “Special Report” that he thinks President Trump is “the most corrupt president in American history” and that he has “more than met the criteria for impeachment.”

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is “a moment of truth for the country,” adding that “sooner or later it had to come.”

He went on to say that the announcement is also “a moment of truth for the Republican Party.""

A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office.

Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States.

READ THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO

Scrutiny of Trump's conversation with the President of Ukraine was sparked by an unidentified whistleblower, who reportedly accused the President of making a ""promise"" to a foreign leader. Subsequent reporting raised new questions after it was revealed the White House had withheld millions of dollars of aid for Ukraine and allegedly pressured the Ukranian President to launch an investigation of Joe Biden's son.

""The phone call is kind of a world away from what we were told it was going to be,"" said Bruce. ""We were told it was a quid-pro-quo...but, in reality, it seems very different than that...We're all kind of smiling here with some of these developments.""

""We're all kind of smiling here with these developments"" — Tammy Bruce, Fox Nation host

Wall Street Journal editorial board member Bill McGurn agreed with Bruce, calling the phone call a ""nothing burger,"" and he slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for falsely declaring the opening of an ""official impeachment investigation,"" which technically requires a House vote.

Assistant editor of the Wall Street Journal editorial page and Fox News contributor James Freeman believes the Democrats may have fallen into a trap.

""You read the transcript...you almost wonder if this whistleblower--instead of being an anti-Trump guy, secretly has a red hat at home,"" he joked, referring to the famous red MAGA caps associated with the support of President Trump.

""Was it Ivanka with a mustache calling them up?"" Bruce chimed in, suggesting that speculation about the call may have worked in Trump's favor.

Mary Anastasia O'Grady, who is also a Wall Street Journal editorial board member, stressed that Pelosi did not open an official investigation as she said, but ""expanded the number of committees that are going to investigate.""

""So you're going to have a lot of hearings, people might get the sense that there's an inquiry going on...and yet there hasn't been a vote for that,"" she explained. ""I think they're going to drag that on for a long time, and you know, tarnish the president, even if in the end they don't actually take it to the floor.""

McGurn said the Democrats' impeachment tactics represent something deeper, and that if they truly believed America supported the President's impeachment, they would bring it to a House vote.

MEDIA MOVED THE GOALPOSTS AFTER RELEASE OF TRUMP UKRAINE PHONE CALL

""This is a reflection of the Democrats' lack of confidence in their candidates in 2020. They think Biden might be too old and weak to beat Trump, and they worry Warren might be too left-wing,"" he said.

""Otherwise why would you -- so close to an election -- not... take your case to the American people that Donald Trump is unfit and vote him out. It's a reflection that they don't have confidence that they can persuade the American people of the rightness of their cause.""

Trump responded to calls for impeachment Wednesday with an early-morning tweet decrying the probe.

“There has been no President in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt,"" he tweeted.

But Pelosi argued that she needed to protect the most vulnerable Democratic members of Congress – the ones who in 2018 won 40 Republican House seats, including many in districts where most voters solidly supported Trump in 2016 and likely still do.

Pelosi finally came around Tuesday. She did so after the most recent evidence of Trump asking the Ukrainian president to “look into” former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter regarding the younger Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine and Joe Biden’s role in the dismissal of a prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian company on whose board Hunter Biden served.

Pelosi spoke not long after several potentially vulnerable freshmen Democratic representatives announced their support for an impeachment investigation.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, DESCRIBE CALL AS MAFIA-STYLE ‘SHAKEDOWN’

Pelosi has – not surprisingly – behaved very much as the daughter of a politician (her father was a congressman and later mayor of Baltimore) would be expected to. She has stayed close to her base and shown she knows how to count votes. These are the same political skills she used to regain the speakership, even after presiding over the loss of a Democratic majority in the House.

But the impeachment target, President Trump, has historic political skills of his own. For all the talk of him being a first-time politician, he has skills honed from years of New York tabloid wars and reality television. That’s no “diss.” This is a man who knows how to create suspense and navigate a career doing summersaults on a trapeze without a net.

Don’t underestimate a resume that reads: a hotshot real estate developer, a tabloid celebrity and casino operator who declared corporate bankruptcy and recovered; a reality TV star; a Democrat turned leading Republican; and now someone who rides in Air Force One and sits in the Oval Office.

Many have enjoyed laughing at Donald Trump, but few have made money betting against him.

Pelosi knows how to play the inside political game – but Trump remains a master at the public art of politics.

To date, Trump has been effective at convincing enough Americans to oppose impeachment. A Fox News poll in July – just before now-former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress – showed that 45 percent of registered voters believed Trump should not be impeached, while 42 percent believed he should be impeached and removed from office. Another 5 percent believed Trump should be impeached but not removed.

Many have enjoyed laughing at Donald Trump, but few have made money betting against him.

The recent revelation that Trump sought to get the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden – the president’s potential 2020 reelection opponent – may change that, as could the House Democrats’ decision to open an impeachment investigation. But it’s equally likely that Americans will just move ever closer to their current polarized positions.

My advice on polls about impeachment: start paying attention next week, after this current news cycle has played out and we can gauge public reaction.

In the face of all this, here’s a look at the strategy that each side is likely to play.

Pelosi and House Democrats have three goals in mind: keep their majority in the House, win the presidency, and see a Democratic majority in the Senate. They believe there is evidence against Trump – some of which the Trump administration has not been sharing – that either rises to the level of impeachment or at the least casts Trump in a very negative light.

While some people argue that there is no way that a Republican-controlled Senate will find a two-thirds majority to convict and remove Trump from office, many Democrats may not care. They will find it strategically useful to have nonstop television news coverage of impeachment hearings about what they believe is evidence that will reflect negatively on the president.

And while some Democrats say an impeachment investigation shouldn’t interfere with the 2020 election, others will welcome the chance to have the investigation play out just as the election campaign is in full swing.

An alternative viewpoint is that Trump – in a way – welcomes the impeachment investigation. Those who hold this view believe it plays into the president’s theme that he is fighting against a “Deep State” in order to “drain the swamp.”

Like President Bill Clinton (yes, Bill Clinton) and a champion bullfighter, Trump has shown himself to be most effective when his back is against the wall and everyone thinks he’s about to fail.

Despite six corporate bankruptcies, multiple accusations of wrongdoing against him, a special counsel’s investigation and daily attacks by Democrats and the media, Trump is still able to go thumbs-up behind the Resolute desk.

For those of us who refuse to underestimate Trump, the fact that he released a summary Wednesday of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and spoke to reporters with Zelensky after the two met at the United Nations suggests Trump might have something up his sleeve.

TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT

The summary shows that while Trump sought an investigation of Biden family dealings in Ukraine, there isn’t a direct quote explicitly linking the request to U.S. aid.

Speaking to reporters alongside Trump, Zelensky said Wednesday that Trump did not pressure him to investigate the Biden family in the July 25 call.

“Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said. “We had a great phone call.”

Republican senators – especially those up for reelection in 2020 – face a double bind. Polls universally show Trump with strong support among Republicans. As a result, if GOP senators attack Trump they open themselves to a threat of a Republican primary from that solid Trump base, or reduced turnout among Republicans in the general election.

However, if Republican senators are too strongly associated with Trump and are seen as ignoring what many non-Republican voters see as his misconduct, the senators may find it difficult to win reelection in the battleground states of Arizona, Colorado, Maine, North Carolina and even Georgia. Republican senators seeking reelection in those states and others want the support of some independents and even moderate Democrats in November 2020.

Interestingly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., came out in support of getting to the whistleblower complaint against President Trump regarding the call with Zelensky and apparently other issues released to Congress. McConnell’s reasoning appears to be that if the news is going to be bad, get it out quickly so it can fade in the public mind by November 2020.

For the Democratic presidential hopefuls, the controversy over Ukraine and Biden is a bit of minefield.

For Biden, the whole affair seems to cast him the way he wants: he’s the Democrat’s best chance to be elected president because he’s the guy Trump appears to fear most.

On the other hand, even though there doesn’t appear to be anything to the accusation of improper conduct by the former vice president, it would not be the first time that Trump has forced the media to ask one of his adversaries the equivalent of “When did you stop beating your wife?”

Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was the first to come out in favor of the impeachment of Trump, may see some traction with her core message: See, I told you. And as with other things, you can trust me that I know what we need to do.

For the other Democratic presidential contenders – especially those whose campaigns are still struggling for attention – recent developments are actually bad news: the developments shift attention from their campaign and onto the battle over impeachment.

One thing is certain: the center ring of the political circus is going to be the outcome of the impeachment investigation of the president. And it’s a fight between a master of outsized public spectacle and a master of hidden vote counting.

If you did, hold on to those memories. It might be the last relaxing moment you'll have for a while. We're about to wreck your peace of mind.

It turns out that all is not well on this blue planet of ours, far from it. Indeed, it appears that the Earth itself is facing what we're going to call tonight, an existential threat from climate change.

Now, what does the term ""existential threat"" actually mean, you ask? Honestly, we don't know. But it sounds absolutely terrifying.

CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS SNARL DC TRAFFIC AS BIZARRE SCENES UNFOLD IN CAPITAL

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., presidential candidate: The climate change is real. It is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., presidential candidate: If NATO is about the common defense, the biggest existential threat is climate change.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, presidential candidate: This is climate change. It really is the existential threat.

Julian Castro, presidential candidate: We're going to have to address the most existential threat to our nation and the world, climate change.

Beto O'Rourke, presidential candidate: On climate change, the greatest existential threat that we face.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., presidential candidate: We are facing a climate crisis, it represents an existential threat to who we are as human beings.

""A threat to who we are as humans."" Well, there are a number of questions here. Let's see if we can unpack them.

The first one: is climate change real? That's an easy one. Of course, it's real. Climate always changes.

If you're in the United States, for example, the ground that you're standing on right now was not so long ago really covered with glacial ice a mile thick. Now, it's not covered in glacial ice a mile thick. So what happened?

What happened is climate change. That's been happening since the Earth cooled. Is human activity accelerating climate change? Can we reverse or slow climate change? Despite what they tell you, no one really knows.

But the real question here has nothing to do with climate science. It has to do with people who pretend they understand climate science. Do those people actually believe what they're saying?

This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets.

Well, let's see. Here was Kamala Harris recently talking at a CNN town hall about how red meat contributes to the absolutely existential threat of climate change.

Harris: As a nation, we have actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating, because we have a problem in America.

Erin Burnett, CNN host: But would you support changing the Dietary Guidelines?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: You know, the food pyramid, what people are eating?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: So reduce red meat specifically.

Harris: Yes, I would.

Got that? Kamala Harris is a good person, and because she is a good person -- a much better person than you are -- she cares about the existential threat of climate change so much, that she is willing to forgo red meat. That's what she told CNN viewers recently.

But when she is in the pork producing state of Iowa, though, it's a very different story. Just this past weekend, Harris attended the Annual Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry. She took her turn working the grill posing for the cameras.

And by the way, so did all of the other Democratic candidates. Liz Warren was there, Beto O'Rourke, even Cory Booker, who says he is a vegan. Organizers grilled more than 10,000 steaks over the weekend. Tape of the event shows plumes of ozone destroying meat smoke rising heavenward. The candidates standing amidst all of this seemed wholly unconcerned.

Are you surprised? Don't be surprised. This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. No one says a word about it.

Last week, millions of concerned progressives took part in the so-called climate strike. In their wake, they left mountains of litter. On Monday in Washington, climate activists demanded change by blocking roads, causing gridlock, and throwing confetti on the ground.

Well, if you're under 40, you might be surprised to learn that people didn't use to express concern about the environment by littering. That used to seem weird, but then the point of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving it and protecting it.

The point now is very different. The point now is political power. You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submit to your will, or else. And as you do that, of course, you don't need to fight fair or acknowledge democracy or make a rational case for your position. You do whatever it takes. You'll even use children, if it helps.

Just today, for example, a 16-year-old Swedish girl named Greta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists. Here's part of what she said:

Thunberg, climate change activist: This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words.

We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.

You stole my childhood? Do what I want you to do, or else you're evil?

How do you respond to statements like that? The truth is you can't respond. And of course, that's the point.

When you use children to demand power, they become a kind of human shield. You can hide safely behind them, no one can criticize you.

But who would do something that unscrupulous? Anyone who would do that is someone who would literally do anything to seize control. And that's exactly what they're doing.

* Last year, former Republican Rep. Darrell Issa retired instead of seeking re-election in California’s 49th district. Today, he’s set to launch a new campaign in California’s 50th district, where incumbent Rep. Duncan Hunter (R) is facing multiple criminal indictments.

* Remember when Tom Price was forced to resign in disgrace from Donald Trump’s cabinet after repeatedly misusing public funds? Price is now reportedly hoping that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) will appoint him to the U.S. Senate after Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) steps down at the end of the year for health reasons.

* Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) wrote on Twitter this morning, “There is a lot in the whistleblower complaint that is concerning. We need to fully investigate all of the allegations addressed in the letter, and the first step is to talk to the whistleblower.” Hurd recently announced his retirement, which makes it easier for him to take positions like these,

* At a press conference yesterday, Donald Trump was asked, “Why should the American people then be comfortable with an American president asking a foreign leader for information about an American citizen?” His response included a reflection on the 2016 electoral college tally – Trump continues to get the numbers wrong – adding, “I can’t help it that my opponent didn’t go to Wisconsin.”

* On a related note, the president isn’t the only one thinking about 2016. The Washington Post reported this week, “A Facebook page called ‘I Love America’ that featured patriotic themes, rippling flags and pro-Trump memes was closed Monday after it turned out to be run by Ukrainians.”

* Despite a slow fundraising start, Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) presidential campaign has some money in the bank, and it’s poised to start spending it: Politico reported this week that Team Warren is launching “an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million.”

* A new national Quinnipiac poll shows Elizabeth Warren inching past Joe Biden, 27% to 25%, in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Bernie Sanders is third with 16%, and Pete Buttigieg, at 7%, was the only other candidate above 5%. In August, Quinnipiac showed Biden leading Warren by 13 points.

* Also of interest from the same poll: among African-American Democrats, Biden’s lead over Warren in July was 49 points. Now, it’s 21 points.

* To the surprise of no one, Donald Trump’s political operation is trying to raise money off the House Democrats’ impeachment effort.

* In New Hampshire, a Monmouth poll released yesterday showed Warren narrowly leading Biden, 27% to 25%. Sanders is third with 12%, followed by Buttigieg at 10%. No other candidate reached double digits.

* In California, a new UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll, conducted for the Los Angeles Times, found Warren leading Biden, 29% to 22%. Sanders was third with 19%, while Kamala Harris, in her home state, was fourth with 8%.

* The former vice president has not, however, lost his lead in all of the latest polls: a national Emerson poll released yesterday showed Biden narrowly leading Warren, 25% to 23%, with Sanders very close behind at 22%. As Rachel noted on last night’s show, this is the same poll that found Andrew Yang at 8%.

* Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, still struggling to break through in the Democratic presidential race, endorsed the impeachment process against Trump yesterday. Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang reached the same conclusion yesterday. Tulsi Gabbard, however, criticized impeachment as “divisive.”

* Speaking of the Hawaii congresswoman, Gabbard was at 2% support in New Hampshire in the aforementioned Monmouth poll, which appears to qualify her for next month’s presidential primary debate.

* And with just six weeks remaining before Kentucky’s gubernatorial election, incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) shook up his campaign leadership this week, shifting operational control to Michael Antonopoulos, a longtime GOP strategist."

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Sen. Warren, D-Mass., stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with former Vice President Joe Biden commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Trump told MacCallum she didn't know that many people who could ""stand to vote for her.""

Trump also weighed in on her father-in-law's latest controversy regarding a phone call with the leader of Ukraine saying ""nothing he did was wrong"" and that Democrats have ""backed themselves into a corner"" with impeachment.

Her comments came as Biden faced renewed scrutiny and many observers speculated that the Democratic primary season was narrowing down to a race between himself and Warren. A Monmouth poll released on Tuesday showed Warren leading Biden in New Hampshire, the first primary state of 2020.

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER - BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

On Wednesday, Trump released a transcript of a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in which the two discussed investigating Biden over corruption allegations.

Biden, who has been the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, attracted scrutiny for pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating a natural gas firm where his son, Hunter, served on the board of directors.

Republicans have used the opportunity to turn the tables on Biden, claiming that the Ukraine controversy highlighted how Biden abused his power while in office.

Warren also seemed to benefit from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to impeach Trump, something Pelosi, D-Calif., announced on Tuesday despite previous calls from Warren and others.

Pelosi resisted calls for impeachment surrounding the Russia investigation but seemed to face a tipping point after news surfaced about Trump's call with Zelensky. The speaker decried Trump's conduct while also accusing his administration of breaking the law by trying to suppress a whistleblower report on the president's comments.

Warren, on Saturday, was just one of many to pressure Pelosi after the initial news surfaced and before the speaker announced impeachment proceedings.

""Congress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” Warren said, apparently knocking Pelosi's previous reluctance on the issue."

The swipes signal what could be a newly aggressive phase for the Vermont senator's campaign, with a hitherto ""truce"" between him and Warren beginning to crack as his polling numbers suffer. One progressive strategist with ties to the independent senator’s campaign said that when it comes to negating Warren’s surge in the polls, the Sanders team has been “flailing around.”

WARREN SURGES IN LATEST POLLS, TIES BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT; SANDERS SLIPS TO DISTANT THIRD

Sanders and Warren met last December before they launched their presidential bids and agreed to not criticize each other while on the campaign trail. That non-aggression-style pact has largely held – with both teaming up at recent presidential debates to defend their ""Medicare-for-all"" proposals.

And both had refrained from attacking each other.

“Bernie and I have been friends for many, many years. Long before I ever got into politics. And I don’t see any reason that that should change,” Warren told reporters recently after being asked if she was going to start painting contrasts with Sanders.

Sanders – who’s making his second straight White House run – has repeatedly said when asked about Warren that “Elizabeth is a friend of mine” and noting that the two “have been friends for over 20 years.”

But that’s apparently not stopping some leading members of Sanders' team from taking aim at Warren.

The Sanders campaign’s national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray recently criticized Warren on Twitter for failing to support Sanders’ national rent control proposal. Warren has said she doesn’t think such a policy would be realistic across the country. Gray used Warren’s viral zinger from the July debate in targeting the senator from Massachusetts.

Gray also jabbed at Warren over her campaign's lack of a collective bargaining agreement with her staff since recognizing her campaign workers’ union in June.

Sanders also faced a bit of criticism as he met the demands from his own unionized campaign staff.

In another case, senior Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels took aim at Warren’s climate change plan. As Vox noted, Gunnels retweeted a tweet from a New York City councilman saying that Warren had “missed the mark.”

As they were battling for second place in the polls most of the summer, the Sanders campaign repeatedly insisted that former Vice President Joe Biden was the main target. The former vice president was the clear front-runner in nearly all polling from his entry into the race in late April until recent days, when a slew of new surveys suggested that Warren had tied Biden for the top spot.

WARREN LANDS BACKING OF PROGRESSIVE GROUP THAT ENDORSED SANDERS IN HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID

While Sanders kept his focus on Biden, Warren surged in polling and, in a well-publicized moment, she landed the endorsement of the progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid. Meanwhile, Sanders in recent weeks has replaced a couple of key staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar.

“They thought their opponent was Biden because they thought he was the next Hillary Clinton,” noted the progressive strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.

The strategist argued that the Sanders campaign failed to realize that Warren was the real threat, spotlighting that “their strategy was wrong. They were looking at Biden as the main opponent when it was really Warren.”"

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two populist standard-bearers in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The National Union of Healthcare Workers – which backed the independent senator from Vermont in his 2016 Democratic presidential primary bid – announced on Thursday that they’ll provide resources and grassroots support to both Sanders and Warren.

SANDERS CAMPAIGN SWIPES AT WARREN, TESTING TRUCE BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE 2020 CHAMPIONS

The union explained that the gap between Warren and Sanders in a vote by union members was close enough that the union’s executive board decided on Wednesday to endorse both candidates.

“This is not your typical union endorsement. We didn’t tell our members how to vote, they told us,” union president Sal Rosselli said. “We trust our members and their judgments and the outcome of this vote reflects the collective will of members from San Diego to the Oregon border. Our members clearly like both Senators Warren and Sanders.”

“After reviewing the vote totals, our executive board felt that an endorsement of both candidates was most fair due to the closeness of the vote,” he explained.

Union members voted from Sunday through Wednesday, with members able to cast a ballot for up to three candidates. Warren received the most votes, appearing on 61 percent of ballots, with Sanders showing up on 50 percent of ballots.

Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris appeared on 34 percent of ballots. She was endorsed by the union in her races for California attorney general and her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth in the voting, showing up on 32 percent of ballots.

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN IN LATEST POLLS, SANDERS SLIPS TO THIRD

The splitting of the endorsement comes as some in the Sanders campaign are starting to take aim at Warren. Both Sanders and Warren have – to date – refrained for criticizing each other.

But new national and early voting state polls released over the past week indicate Warren soaring into a tie with long-time front-runner Biden for the top spot in the 2020 Democratic battle, with Sanders dipping to third.

Earlier this month Warren landed the endorsement of the New York-based progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid."

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Warren – the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another – stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with the former vice president commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Sanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month.

""After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. ""We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind.""

Going beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way.""

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Many political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar.

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent.

A couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

And in Iowa, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

The release of the surveys come as Warren’s campaign on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary.

WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES

The release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics.

Warren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”

The pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, “I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.”

But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, “no.”

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT IN RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: “I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.”

The ""details"" to which Warren was referring are from the two ethics plans she's unveiled to tackle corruption in government. Her campaign later clarified to the Washington Post that the plans wouldn't prevent any child of a vice president from serving on such a board.

Warren’s comments came hours after the White House released a transcript of Trump’s call from this past July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The readout showed that the president asked Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations regarding the Biden family’s dealings with Ukraine. However, the transcript did not suggest Trump leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine to obtain a “promise” of an investigation.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country’s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama’s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor – who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

TRUMP TRIES TO TURN TABLES ON DEMOCRATS IN UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

Trump on Wednesday emphasized that there was no quid pro quo during his call with the Ukrainian president, saying, “I didn’t do it.” Trump spoke with reporters one day after House Democrats kicked off their formal impeachment inquiry. They’re investigating whether the Republican president broke the law by allegedly asking a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 election by asking for Ukraine’s assistance in investigating the Bidens.

Warren kicked off her event – in front of a crowd estimated at 900 people by her campaign – by emphasizing, “nobody’s above the law... not even the president.” And, she repeated her call that “it is time for impeachment now.”

The Massachusetts senator was one of the first 2020 Democrats to call for Trump’s impeachment. She did it this past spring, citing findings from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report.

Asked if she had any confidence that the GOP-controlled Senate would take action if the House impeached Trump, Warren told reporters, “I don’t know what the Senate will do under (Majority Leader) Mitch McConnel’s control, but right now we have to do what is right regardless of the politics.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

She continued, “Donald Trump had established he believed that he was above the law, and that’s what the Mueller report shows, that he obstructed justice, and he was not held accountable by our Congress. So, he came back in the summer and did it again, inviting a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election.”

Warren’s stop in New Hampshire came a day after a new poll indicated that she held a slight two-point advantage over Biden in the crucial primary state.

BIDEN HITS THE SKIDS IN NEW Q POLL

Politico: “A new national survey shows Elizabeth Warren now sitting atop the 2020 Democratic field… Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.”



Trump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters - NYT: “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.”



Warren ready for air war with $10 million buy - Politico: “Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.”



Buttigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy - CBS News: “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator John McCain's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President Barack Obama, Justin Timberlake and Tom Hanks, is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’”



Sanders touts dozen of union member endorsements - The Hill: “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.”

TIME OUT: WELL PACKAGED PEANUTS

New Yorker: “Timing is the life force of comics. Without a sensitivity to the rhythms and the music—a.k.a. the reality—of life, a comic strip will arrive D.O.A., nothing more than a bunch of dumb pictures. … The reader doesn’t just look at Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy but reads them as musical notes in a silently heard composition of hilarity, cruelty, and occasional melancholy. In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver. The strip was created out of four equally sized panels, which allowed it to run horizontally, vertically, or stacked two by two. … Who would’ve thought that such a hard-nosed commercial decision would catalyze one of the greatest works of popular art of the twentieth century?”

TRUMP LEANED ON UKRAINIAN LEADER FOR BIDEN DIRT

WSJ: “President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to ‘look into’ former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and said he would direct his personal lawyer and attorney general to reach out to Mr. Zelensky to ‘get to the bottom of it,’ according to a document released by the White House designed to memorialize a July phone call between the leaders. The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.”



Trump lawyer: State Department directed involvement - WashEx: “President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.”



Pelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.”



Poll shows reason for her caution - WaPo: “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”



Silver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? - FiveThirtyEight: “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas. Kris Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” – James Belany, Pittsburgh



[Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans.]

Chortle if you will at my Cubbies misfortune -- but just wait until next year!” – Stephen J. Tock, Dwight, Ill.



[Ed. note: I can’t go so far as to say that I felt “bad” for the Cubs, but I can say that I admire your determination, Mr. Tock. And we can all be proud to say that the National League Central continues to be the best, most competitive division in baseball. And with three games left against the Cards, I’m sure your squad will try hard to avenge the Wrigley sweep!]

HAPPY HUMP DAY

AP: “A veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics to a camel owned by a Louisiana truck stop petting zoo after a woman bit the 600-pound (272-kilogram) animal to free herself from under its weight. Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office documents obtained by The Advocate on Monday accuse Florida couple Gloria and Edmond Lancaster of throwing treats for their unleashed dog into Caspar the camel's enclosure at Tiger Truck Stop. The couple told deputies the camel attacked the dog, but the sheriff's office said the couple had provoked the animal before it sat on Gloria Lancaster. She'd crawled under barbed wire to retrieve her pet. Gloria Lancaster told officers she had to bite the camel to free herself. Truck stop manager Pamela Bossier said a veterinarian prescribed Caspar antibiotics as a precaution.”

‘DESERVE’S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT’

Let’s start with the precondition that we don’t care whether you think the investigation into President Trump’s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to prosecute his political rivals is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” grounds for immediate impeachment or something in between.



We care in the sense that we’re sure that you are sincere in your beliefs and we acknowledge your God-given right to feel and think the way you do. What we mean is that in order to discern what might happen next, such feelings are hindrances. It’s hard to clearly consider such outcomes when you think in terms of your own beliefs.



This note, for example, would be a poor source for Major League Baseball forecasting since it is our position that the St. Louis Cardinals not only will win it all but deserve to win it all.



As William Munny told Little Bill Daggett right before he blew his head off with a Spencer repeating rifle on a saloon floor: “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”



There are plenty of people who think that Bill Clinton unfairly beat the rap, and even some who still think Richard Nixon got a raw deal. If you flipped through the back pages of enough bibliographies, you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old Andy Johnson.



Woodrow Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke in his second term, with his wife acting as a kind of regent for his last 17 months in office but Congress took no action. Warren Harding’s administration – in particular his Interior and Justice departments – was a quagmire of corruption, but he was dead and buried before any of it came to light. Lyndon Johnson grievously abused the powers of office for political advantage but he never faced any repercussions.



The rightness or wrongness of a president’s actions are all but immaterial in these matters. Whether the supporters or detractors of the aforementioned men were correct or not was of no consequence.

Now, that’s not to say that the passionate partisan bawling that we’re all now being subjected to won’t have an effect on what eventually does happen.



Studies suggest that home field advantage in sports is not only real but quite possibly the result of referees showing favoritism because of “the social atmosphere in the stadium.” The same is true with allegations of presidential misconduct.



We’ve said it many times before, but it bears repeating: Impeachment is a political proposition, not a legal one. And the referees here are the undecided or persuadable voters not yet sure what to make of what’s happening.



But even if you want to be part of working the refs – screaming into the orc-filled chasms of Twitter or annoying friends and loved ones with forwarded emails and Facebook posts – you probably still want to be able to think clearly about where it goes from here.



And that’s what we intend to help you do in the days ahead. You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.



For the sake of everybody who is going to be out there fighting passionately for their side, whatever it is, we’ll do our best to not pick one.

TIME OUT: ONCE UPON A TIME…

NatGeo: “The brothers Grimm published what would become one of the most influential and famous collections of folklore in the world. Children’s and Household Tales (Kinder und Hausmärchen), later titled Grimm’s Fairy Tales, are childhood-defining stories. The Grimms, however, had curated the collection as an academic anthology for scholars of German culture, not as a collection of bedtime stories for young readers. Amid the political and social turbulence of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), as France conquered Germanic lands, Jacob and Wilhelm were driven by nationalism to highlight their homeland and heritage. They were inspired by German Romantic authors and philosophers who believed that the purest forms of culture, those that bonded a community, could be found in stories shared from generation to generation.

WARREN SLIPS AND SWIPES BIDEN ON ETHICS

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, ‘I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.’ But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, ‘no.’ When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: ‘I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.’”



More family woes for Biden - Politico: “Joe Biden’s brother told executives at a healthcare firm that the former vice president’s cancer initiative would promote their business, according to a participant in the conversation, who said the promise came as part of a pitch on behalf of potential investors in the firm. The allegation is the latest of many times Biden’s relatives have invoked the former vice president and his political clout to further their private business dealings. It is the first that involves the Biden Cancer Initiative, a project Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his post-White House life following the death of his son Beau. Biden’s brother, James, made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden’s business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records.”



Sanders gives supporters the stage in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “As a Democratic candidate for president, [Bernie] Sanders frequently pushes his policies pugnaciously, framing them as moral imperatives as much as practical matters. But in his recent four-day swing through Iowa, he balanced his high-volume sermons with stories from his supporters. … Respondents who watched the September televised debate, where Sanders — who approached the debate stage with his typical fervor, but with a hoarse rasp — were more likely to have an unfavorable view of him. The debate-stage Sanders, whose style is described by some, including one of his 2020 rivals, as ""yelling"", was less present in his late September Iowa swing, Instead, Sanders often gave up the microphone to let others speak. … At his Iowa events, some of the personal stories are arranged in advance. But others are organic — hearing the stories of others inspires Sanders supporters to tell their own.”



Biden leads the pack in Maryland - Goucher College: “The Goucher College Poll asked Maryland Democratic likely voters who they are currently planning to vote for in the Maryland Democratic presidential primary… Thirty-three percent of Maryland Democratic likely voters say they will vote for Joe Biden and 21 percent for Elizabeth Warren. Ten percent would vote for Bernie Sanders, 6 percent for Kamala Harris, and 5 percent for Pete Buttigieg. All other candidates earn support from 1 percent or fewer of voters. Fifteen percent have no preference or are undecided. …Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College [said,] ‘Democrats in Maryland are divided over whether they want a more moderate or progressive nominee and whether nominating a candidate who can defeat Trump or match their policy preferences is their top priority.’”



ISSA TO CHALLENGE DUNCAN HUNTER

NYT: “Darrell Issa, the former nine-term congressman from California, will try to return to Congress by challenging Representative Duncan Hunter, who was indicted last year, setting up a clash among two Trump allies for one of Republicans’ most endangered seats. Mr. Issa is expected to announce his challenge at a news conference on Thursday morning in the San Diego County district, according to two sources familiar with his decision. He had been publicly mulling for months whether to make a bid to return to Congress, and started an exploratory committee in August. ‘I have received such a tremendous outpouring of encouragement from supporters inside the district, and around the state and across the nation,’ Mr. Issa said in August in a statement posted to the committee’s website. Mr. Issa will likely bill himself to Republicans as a safer alternative than the incumbent.”



Michigan announces new automatic voter registration - MLive: “Michigan took a leap forward into the modern era by announcing new voter registration policies on National Voter Registration Day. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced [Tuesday] that automatic voter registration has officially launched in Michigan and online voter registration will be available following the November 2019 election. “Making voter registration automatic for eligible citizens means more Michigan residents will have access to participating in our democracy,” Benson said in a release. … Michigan joins 17 other states and the District of Columbia in enacting automatic voter registration.”

*AHEM* THEY GOT TRASHED

News24: “A South Korean mayor who dumped a ton of trash on a clean beach to give environmental campaigners something to pick up has said sorry for his deception. Officials trucked in litter and waste that had already been collected from rubbish-strewn coasts, and scattered it all over the pristine sand of southwest Jindo. The following day hundreds of volunteers scoured the shores and bagged up the garbage as part of an event to mark International Coastal Cleanup Day, a global event aimed at countering the scourge of sea-borne waste. ‘We brought in waste styrofoam and other coastal trash gathered from nearby areas so the 600 participants could carry out clean-up activities,’ said Lee Dong-jin, Jindo county mayor, in a statement. His office apologised for causing trouble and said the event was meant to ‘raise awareness about the seriousness of coastal waste.’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“One day, we shall all have to account for what we did and what we said in this scoundrel year. For now, we each have our conscience to attend to.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on June 9, 2016.

Rosenhaus explained on Warren Sapp’s “99 Problems” podcast that Brown’s abrupt “retirement” from the league was premature and that he believes Brown still wants to play in the league.

ANTONIO BROWN ATTENDS DEPOSITION IN CONDO-TRASHING CASE; FOOTAGE SHOWS FURNITURE RAINING DOWN ON COMPLEX POOL

“I believe that Antonio wants to continue his career in the NFL and I’ve mentioned that. I have had discussions with a few teams that are very interested in him and want to know about his future and what’s going on with the NFL,” Rosenhaus said. “Hopefully, when that is all resolved, Antonio will be able to continue his Hall of Fame career. That’s really where our focus is.”

Brown was released by the New England Patriots after one game and just 11 days with the team. He was accused of sexual assault and rape in a civil lawsuit filed in Florida, and a separate sexual assault and allegation surfaced in a report in Sports Illustrated last week. Brown was released after that report.

ANTONIO BROWN BACK TO SCHOOL AT CENTRAL MICHIGAN AFTER PATRIOTS RELEASE

Meanwhile, Brown announced he was taking classes at Central Michigan University and appeared at a deposition hearing over a furniture-throwing case. Rosenhaus said he encourages all his clients to finish their degrees or receive a post-graduate degree and that Brown taking the classes doesn’t mean the wide receiver is finished with football completely.

“I know there’s been a lot of speculation as to whether or not that means he’s not going to proceed with the NFL but taking online college courses to get your degree or your post-graduate degree is something that I would recommend to every client. I wouldn’t read too much into that,” he said.

He added: “Obviously, it’s a very difficult time for him not playing. We expected him to be playing against the Jets on Sunday. So it’s tough. It’s tough for someone who loves the game not to be playing right now and the hope is that we will cooperate with the NFL and their investigation and get him back with a team to continue this tremendous career that he’s had.”

Rosenhaus didn’t specify how many teams have shown interest in Brown since his release. A source told Pro Football Talk that at least three teams had shown interest."

Pelosi made the announcement following a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol, saying that ""the president must be held accountable"" for what she called the ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

The only Democratic hopeful to explicitly come out against impeachment was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business' “Kennedy” on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very ""divisive"" for a country that is already divided.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

“Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,” tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “I agree with @SpeakerPelosi— no one is above the law. He must be impeached.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Special Counsel Robert Mueller spoke publicly about the findings of his Russia investigation, tweeted on Tuesday evening, “In 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.""

Mueller’s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Booker added, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry—it’s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.”

Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.”

Following Pelosi’s announcement, Biden tweeted, “Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.”

Earlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump’s alleged actions “an abuse of power.”

“They undermine our national security,” Biden tweeted. “They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: ""Billionaires should not be able to control our political system.""

During a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, “If you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.”

In a statement, former Texas rep. Beto O’Rourke said he is “grateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump” and called her announcement “a defining moment for our country.”

“For more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in Texas, I have been clear that I support impeachment,” O’Rourke said. “We all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted on Tuesday, “Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.”

Yang added: “Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.”

In a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, “A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.”

He added that he still agrees that moving forward “is for the best,” saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation “that may unearth new details.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., tweeted simply, “The House did the right thing.”

Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi’s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that “she deserves our support.”

""The President’s behavior, combined with the administration’s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,"" Delaney added. ""Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement ""an overdue but important step.”

""Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,"" she said. ""The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.”

Billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump’s alleged criminal behavior.

“Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what’s right, not what’s politically convenient,” Steyer said. “We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.”

Earlier this month, Steyer told Fox News' Bret Baier during an interview on “Special Report” that he thinks President Trump is “the most corrupt president in American history” and that he has “more than met the criteria for impeachment.”

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is “a moment of truth for the country,” adding that “sooner or later it had to come.”

He went on to say that the announcement is also “a moment of truth for the Republican Party.""

A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office.

Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States.

READ THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO

Scrutiny of Trump's conversation with the President of Ukraine was sparked by an unidentified whistleblower, who reportedly accused the President of making a ""promise"" to a foreign leader. Subsequent reporting raised new questions after it was revealed the White House had withheld millions of dollars of aid for Ukraine and allegedly pressured the Ukranian President to launch an investigation of Joe Biden's son.

""The phone call is kind of a world away from what we were told it was going to be,"" said Bruce. ""We were told it was a quid-pro-quo...but, in reality, it seems very different than that...We're all kind of smiling here with some of these developments.""

""We're all kind of smiling here with these developments"" — Tammy Bruce, Fox Nation host

Wall Street Journal editorial board member Bill McGurn agreed with Bruce, calling the phone call a ""nothing burger,"" and he slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for falsely declaring the opening of an ""official impeachment investigation,"" which technically requires a House vote.

Assistant editor of the Wall Street Journal editorial page and Fox News contributor James Freeman believes the Democrats may have fallen into a trap.

WH TO RELEASE DOCUMENT SHOWING INTEL COMMUNITY IG FOUND WHISTLEBLOWER HAD 'POLITICAL BIAS', SOURCE SAYS

""You read the transcript...you almost wonder if this whistleblower--instead of being an anti-Trump guy, secretly has a red hat at home,"" he joked, referring to the famous red MAGA caps associated with the support of President Trump.

""Was it Ivanka with a mustache calling them up?"" Bruce chimed in, suggesting that speculation about the call may have worked in Trump's favor.

Mary Anastasia O'Grady, who is also a Wall Street Journal editorial board member, stressed that Pelosi did not open an official investigation as she said, but ""expanded the number of committees that are going to investigate.""

UKRAINE CALL MEMO SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, BUT DID NOT MENTION AID

""So you're going to have a lot of hearings, people might get the sense that there's an inquiry going on...and yet there hasn't been a vote for that,"" she explained. ""I think they're going to drag that on for a long time, and you know, tarnish the president, even if in the end they don't actually take it to the floor.""

McGurn said the Democrats' impeachment tactics represent something deeper, and that if they truly believed America supported the President's impeachment, they would bring it to a House vote.

MEDIA MOVED THE GOALPOSTS AFTER RELEASE OF TRUMP UKRAINE PHONE CALL

""This is a reflection of the Democrats' lack of confidence in their candidates in 2020. They think Biden might be too old and weak to beat Trump, and they worry Warren might be too left-wing,"" he said.

""Otherwise why would you -- so close to an election -- not... take your case to the American people that Donald Trump is unfit and vote him out. It's a reflection that they don't have confidence that they can persuade the American people of the rightness of their cause.""

Trump responded to calls for impeachment Wednesday with an early-morning tweet decrying the probe.

“There has been no President in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt,"" he tweeted.

But Pelosi argued that she needed to protect the most vulnerable Democratic members of Congress – the ones who in 2018 won 40 Republican House seats, including many in districts where most voters solidly supported Trump in 2016 and likely still do.

Pelosi finally came around Tuesday. She did so after the most recent evidence of Trump asking the Ukrainian president to “look into” former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter regarding the younger Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine and Joe Biden’s role in the dismissal of a prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian company on whose board Hunter Biden served.

Pelosi spoke not long after several potentially vulnerable freshmen Democratic representatives announced their support for an impeachment investigation.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, DESCRIBE CALL AS MAFIA-STYLE ‘SHAKEDOWN’

Pelosi has – not surprisingly – behaved very much as the daughter of a politician (her father was a congressman and later mayor of Baltimore) would be expected to. She has stayed close to her base and shown she knows how to count votes. These are the same political skills she used to regain the speakership, even after presiding over the loss of a Democratic majority in the House.

But the impeachment target, President Trump, has historic political skills of his own. For all the talk of him being a first-time politician, he has skills honed from years of New York tabloid wars and reality television. That’s no “diss.” This is a man who knows how to create suspense and navigate a career doing summersaults on a trapeze without a net.

Don’t underestimate a resume that reads: a hotshot real estate developer, a tabloid celebrity and casino operator who declared corporate bankruptcy and recovered; a reality TV star; a Democrat turned leading Republican; and now someone who rides in Air Force One and sits in the Oval Office.

Many have enjoyed laughing at Donald Trump, but few have made money betting against him.

Pelosi knows how to play the inside political game – but Trump remains a master at the public art of politics.

To date, Trump has been effective at convincing enough Americans to oppose impeachment. A Fox News poll in July – just before now-former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress – showed that 45 percent of registered voters believed Trump should not be impeached, while 42 percent believed he should be impeached and removed from office. Another 5 percent believed Trump should be impeached but not removed.

Many have enjoyed laughing at Donald Trump, but few have made money betting against him.

The recent revelation that Trump sought to get the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden – the president’s potential 2020 reelection opponent – may change that, as could the House Democrats’ decision to open an impeachment investigation. But it’s equally likely that Americans will just move ever closer to their current polarized positions.

My advice on polls about impeachment: start paying attention next week, after this current news cycle has played out and we can gauge public reaction.

In the face of all this, here’s a look at the strategy that each side is likely to play.

Pelosi and House Democrats have three goals in mind: keep their majority in the House, win the presidency, and see a Democratic majority in the Senate. They believe there is evidence against Trump – some of which the Trump administration has not been sharing – that either rises to the level of impeachment or at the least casts Trump in a very negative light.

While some people argue that there is no way that a Republican-controlled Senate will find a two-thirds majority to convict and remove Trump from office, many Democrats may not care. They will find it strategically useful to have nonstop television news coverage of impeachment hearings about what they believe is evidence that will reflect negatively on the president.

And while some Democrats say an impeachment investigation shouldn’t interfere with the 2020 election, others will welcome the chance to have the investigation play out just as the election campaign is in full swing.

An alternative viewpoint is that Trump – in a way – welcomes the impeachment investigation. Those who hold this view believe it plays into the president’s theme that he is fighting against a “Deep State” in order to “drain the swamp.”

Like President Bill Clinton (yes, Bill Clinton) and a champion bullfighter, Trump has shown himself to be most effective when his back is against the wall and everyone thinks he’s about to fail.

Despite six corporate bankruptcies, multiple accusations of wrongdoing against him, a special counsel’s investigation and daily attacks by Democrats and the media, Trump is still able to go thumbs-up behind the Resolute desk.

For those of us who refuse to underestimate Trump, the fact that he released a summary Wednesday of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and spoke to reporters with Zelensky after the two met at the United Nations suggests Trump might have something up his sleeve.

TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT

The summary shows that while Trump sought an investigation of Biden family dealings in Ukraine, there isn’t a direct quote explicitly linking the request to U.S. aid.

Speaking to reporters alongside Trump, Zelensky said Wednesday that Trump did not pressure him to investigate the Biden family in the July 25 call.

“Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said. “We had a great phone call.”

Republican senators – especially those up for reelection in 2020 – face a double bind. Polls universally show Trump with strong support among Republicans. As a result, if GOP senators attack Trump they open themselves to a threat of a Republican primary from that solid Trump base, or reduced turnout among Republicans in the general election.

However, if Republican senators are too strongly associated with Trump and are seen as ignoring what many non-Republican voters see as his misconduct, the senators may find it difficult to win reelection in the battleground states of Arizona, Colorado, Maine, North Carolina and even Georgia. Republican senators seeking reelection in those states and others want the support of some independents and even moderate Democrats in November 2020.

Interestingly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., came out in support of getting to the whistleblower complaint against President Trump regarding the call with Zelensky and apparently other issues released to Congress. McConnell’s reasoning appears to be that if the news is going to be bad, get it out quickly so it can fade in the public mind by November 2020.

For the Democratic presidential hopefuls, the controversy over Ukraine and Biden is a bit of minefield.

For Biden, the whole affair seems to cast him the way he wants: he’s the Democrat’s best chance to be elected president because he’s the guy Trump appears to fear most.

On the other hand, even though there doesn’t appear to be anything to the accusation of improper conduct by the former vice president, it would not be the first time that Trump has forced the media to ask one of his adversaries the equivalent of “When did you stop beating your wife?”

Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was the first to come out in favor of the impeachment of Trump, may see some traction with her core message: See, I told you. And as with other things, you can trust me that I know what we need to do.

For the other Democratic presidential contenders – especially those whose campaigns are still struggling for attention – recent developments are actually bad news: the developments shift attention from their campaign and onto the battle over impeachment.

One thing is certain: the center ring of the political circus is going to be the outcome of the impeachment investigation of the president. And it’s a fight between a master of outsized public spectacle and a master of hidden vote counting.

* Last year, former Republican Rep. Darrell Issa retired instead of seeking re-election in California’s 49th district. Today, he’s set to launch a new campaign in California’s 50th district, where incumbent Rep. Duncan Hunter (R) is facing multiple criminal indictments.

* Remember when Tom Price was forced to resign in disgrace from Donald Trump’s cabinet after repeatedly misusing public funds? Price is now reportedly hoping that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) will appoint him to the U.S. Senate after Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) steps down at the end of the year for health reasons.

* Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) wrote on Twitter this morning, “There is a lot in the whistleblower complaint that is concerning. We need to fully investigate all of the allegations addressed in the letter, and the first step is to talk to the whistleblower.” Hurd recently announced his retirement, which makes it easier for him to take positions like these,

* At a press conference yesterday, Donald Trump was asked, “Why should the American people then be comfortable with an American president asking a foreign leader for information about an American citizen?” His response included a reflection on the 2016 electoral college tally – Trump continues to get the numbers wrong – adding, “I can’t help it that my opponent didn’t go to Wisconsin.”

* On a related note, the president isn’t the only one thinking about 2016. The Washington Post reported this week, “A Facebook page called ‘I Love America’ that featured patriotic themes, rippling flags and pro-Trump memes was closed Monday after it turned out to be run by Ukrainians.”

* Despite a slow fundraising start, Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) presidential campaign has some money in the bank, and it’s poised to start spending it: Politico reported this week that Team Warren is launching “an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million.”

* And in Wisconsin, where Rep. Sean Duffy (R) is resigning for family reasons, Gov. Tony Evers (D) announced this week that there will be a congressional special election to fill the vacancy on Jan. 27, following a Dec. 30 primary."

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Sen. Warren, D-Mass., stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with former Vice President Joe Biden commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Trump told MacCallum she didn't know that many people who could ""stand to vote for her.""

Trump also weighed in on her father-in-law's latest controversy regarding a phone call with the leader of Ukraine saying ""nothing he did was wrong"" and that Democrats have ""backed themselves into a corner"" with impeachment.

""Stopped for a quick drink at a lemonade stand in Harlan, Iowa. When life gives you lemons, make big structural change!"" Warren said on Twitter.

The two kids were excited about meeting a presidential candidate in person. The Michels girl urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020 after the photo op. The parents instead explained Warren's stance on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to donate to the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, a non-profit that supports pro-life legislation.

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two populist standard-bearers in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The National Union of Healthcare Workers – which backed the independent senator from Vermont in his 2016 Democratic presidential primary bid – announced on Thursday that they’ll provide resources and grassroots support to both Sanders and Warren.

SANDERS CAMPAIGN SWIPES AT WARREN, TESTING TRUCE BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE 2020 CHAMPIONS

The union explained that the gap between Warren and Sanders in a vote by union members was close enough that the union’s executive board decided on Wednesday to endorse both candidates.

“This is not your typical union endorsement. We didn’t tell our members how to vote, they told us,” union president Sal Rosselli said. “We trust our members and their judgments and the outcome of this vote reflects the collective will of members from San Diego to the Oregon border. Our members clearly like both Senators Warren and Sanders.”

“After reviewing the vote totals, our executive board felt that an endorsement of both candidates was most fair due to the closeness of the vote,” he explained.

Union members voted from Sunday through Wednesday, with members able to cast a ballot for up to three candidates. Warren received the most votes, appearing on 61 percent of ballots, with Sanders showing up on 50 percent of ballots.

Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris appeared on 34 percent of ballots. She was endorsed by the union in her races for California attorney general and her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth in the voting, showing up on 32 percent of ballots.

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN IN LATEST POLLS, SANDERS SLIPS TO THIRD

The splitting of the endorsement comes as some in the Sanders campaign are starting to take aim at Warren. Both Sanders and Warren have – to date – refrained for criticizing each other.

But new national and early voting state polls released over the past week indicate Warren soaring into a tie with long-time front-runner Biden for the top spot in the 2020 Democratic battle, with Sanders dipping to third.

Earlier this month Warren landed the endorsement of the New York-based progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the hot seat on Thursday night and quizzed him on whether the middle class will face tax hikes to fund Medicare-for-all similarly to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

""Senator Warren was on here last week and I asked her about her plans for Medicare-for-all and I'm going to ask you the question that I asked her... at the risk of being accused of trumpeting Republican talking points,"" Colbert warned Sanders. ""Is there an increase in taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare-for-all, or rather, where would the tax burden go to pay for that?""

""Under my legislation... nobody in America will pay any more premiums,"" Sanders responded. ""No more co-payments, gone. No more out-of-pocket expenses, gone. Nobody will go bankrupt... because of medical bills, that is gone. Nobody in America under my bill will pay more than $200 a year in total for their prescription drugs.""

""Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not,"" the 2020 hopeful continued. ""So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person's income... Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes.""

ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS SHE WOULDN'T ALLOW THE CHILD OF HER VP TO SIT ON FOREIGN COMPANY BOARD

Last week, Colbert attempted to ask Warren the same question, but struggled to get a direct answer from her.

“You keep being asked in the debates how are you going to pay for it, are you going to be raising the middle-class taxes… How are you going to pay for it? Are you going to be raising the middle-class taxes?” Colbert asked.

“So, here’s how we’re going to do this,” Warren responded. “Costs are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations… and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down.”

“But will their taxes go up?” Colbert pressed.

“But, here’s the thing,” Warren said.

“But, here’s the thing,” Colbert grinningly interrupted. “I’ve listened to these answers a few times before and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence.”

He continued by sharing his “parallel suggestion”: “Isn’t Medicare-for-all like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren’t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?”"

Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, “I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.”

But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, “no.”

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT IN RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: “I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.”

The ""details"" to which Warren was referring are from the two ethics plans she's unveiled to tackle corruption in government. Her campaign later clarified to the Washington Post that the plans wouldn't prevent any child of a vice president from serving on such a board.

Warren’s comments came hours after the White House released a transcript of Trump’s call from this past July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The readout showed that the president asked Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations regarding the Biden family’s dealings with Ukraine. However, the transcript did not suggest Trump leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine to obtain a “promise” of an investigation.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country’s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama’s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor – who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

TRUMP TRIES TO TURN TABLES ON DEMOCRATS IN UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

Trump on Wednesday emphasized that there was no quid pro quo during his call with the Ukrainian president, saying, “I didn’t do it.” Trump spoke with reporters one day after House Democrats kicked off their formal impeachment inquiry. They’re investigating whether the Republican president broke the law by allegedly asking a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 election by asking for Ukraine’s assistance in investigating the Bidens.

Warren kicked off her event – in front of a crowd estimated at 900 people by her campaign – by emphasizing, “nobody’s above the law... not even the president.” And, she repeated her call that “it is time for impeachment now.”

The Massachusetts senator was one of the first 2020 Democrats to call for Trump’s impeachment. She did it this past spring, citing findings from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report.

Asked if she had any confidence that the GOP-controlled Senate would take action if the House impeached Trump, Warren told reporters, “I don’t know what the Senate will do under (Majority Leader) Mitch McConnel’s control, but right now we have to do what is right regardless of the politics.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

She continued, “Donald Trump had established he believed that he was above the law, and that’s what the Mueller report shows, that he obstructed justice, and he was not held accountable by our Congress. So, he came back in the summer and did it again, inviting a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election.”

Warren’s stop in New Hampshire came a day after a new poll indicated that she held a slight two-point advantage over Biden in the crucial primary state.

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: And that is the president of the United States talking about the push for impeachment, there's inquiry on it (ph) right now. The story's raging on all these channels. And Brad Parscale, the man in charge of taking this information, the current state of the economy and the country, and getting the president four more years.

He is in charge of the Trump 2020 reelection campaign and he's walking his dog. So we're going to hear a slice of Brad Parscale's life as well as his profession.

Brad, thanks so much for doing this.

BRAD PARSCALE, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN: Hey, Brian. How are you, bud?

KILMEADE: Good, good. So everyone's talking about the Democrats, they're energized because of this impeachment inquiry and what happened yesterday.

What has it done for Trump 2020?

PARSCALE: Well, I mean, I think one of the most amazing things is just the fundraising we've had in the last 48 hours. I mean, as soon as they -- they started this attack, I think Americans, and -- and Republicans, and supporters of the president all over the country, they started voting with their wallet.

And you know, this is the one thing they can do right now. They can donate. And we've had just thousands and thousands and nearly millions of dollars in donations come in (ph). Sometimes -- many first-time donors. To just see the hypocrisy and the things they're doing right now, and they're upset that their vote is being stolen.

KILMEADE: You know, there was a sense that the more you pushed on the -- if you pushed for impeachment after the Mueller probe, it was good for the president.

But this is something brand new, it's -- everything's happening quicker, maybe it's more understandable.

Does that worry you?

PARSCALE: No, I'm not worried at all. I'm actually -- if you -- if you saw my statements, I'm pretty confident.

Look, the president was sent there from the people to actually deal with this kind of, you know, corruption and to -- and to fight the swamp, and that's what he's doing.

He's doing exactly what the people sent him there to do. And I think -- I don't think one American is going punish him for that.

And the Democrats just know they can't beat him in 2020, so they want to try to use anything they can and lie and cheat to defeat it.

KILMEADE: And that is proof that you did tell the truth. You are walking your dog and he seemed to be startled by something.

PARSCALE: Yes.

(LAUGHTER)

KILMEADE: We'll cover that story, get a correspondent on it.

A couple other things, how close -- have you been in touch with the president?

I will tell you my observation. He had an unbelievably productive United Nations series of meetings.

I know international relations don't usually mean poll numbers, but I think he was really disheartened in his final press conference. He was as subdued as I've (ph) seen him.

I know you could easily say I'm wrong, but you know him as well as anybody. Could you give insight (ph) --

PARSCALE: Yes.

KILMEADE: Can you give me his mindset?

PARSCALE: So I think, first of all -- I mean, like -- you know, I think, like, Merkel and some of these people only did like two or three bilaterals.

I mean, this is how hard the president is working. He's, like, doing 10 -- 11, I think in one day. I mean, he -- he wants to do three times as much as anybody else, plus one.

And that's -- that's just his mindset. I've known him for so long. He always wants to do a little more. There's always more I can do today.

I talked about this from the last rallies, the last days of the 2016 election to U.N. meetings, he's a fighter and he wants to do more.

Look, I don't think he's -- I don't think he's stepped (ph) one step back from this.

He's -- as you saw yesterday in his -- in his -- in his press conference -- hey, sorry -- in his press conference that he's ready to fight.

And he wants to -- he wants to -- he wants to support the American people. Sorry. We're walking by a dog.

KILMEADE: No, I understand. What kind of dog do you have?

PARSCALE: I have -- I have two Labradoodles. My wife picked them out. They're like -- but (ph) they're labs and they just -- they're funny dogs.

KILMEADE: Right. I mean, did you hear the creator of the Labradoodle feels as though they created Frankenstein and they regret doing it?

(LAUGHTER)

PARSCALE: No, they're good dogs. One of them is 9-months-old though, so he gets a little frisky when he walks by dogs.

KILMEADE: The president's got an agenda left.

Number one, the USMCA, he's looking at some type of gun legislation. He -- the White House reached out to Senator Murphy.

He also -- there's talk about doing something on the vaping with the new revelations, and the -- and the 12 deaths and the 400 who've been sickened.

What -- what do you want him -- just from a pure pollster perspective, what do you want to see him tackle?

PARSCALE: Yes, look, I think one thing everybody needs to understand with this president, he's about personal freedom. You know, like he's going to -- he's going to protect the Second Amendment. He's always going to do that.

He's going to protect the personal freedom of you to -- you know, to vape. I think those are things that he wants. He wants to make sure -- but he also cares about people's safety and children. And I think he's -- he's bothered personally by, you know, some of the young people that have been affected by this.

But overall, everything about him is about personal freedom. And we're the party of freedom. And the other party wants to take things away and control what you can and can't do, from -- even if that's a plastic straw in your -- in your drink.

They want to tell you how to live -- they want -- how much sugar you can have, everything else.

We believe that -- and I -- and I truly believe the Republican Party is the party of freedom.

KILMEADE: So you think cracking down with kids under 18, but letting people do what they want to do. Whether it's chewing tobacco, smoking, smoking cigars, you don't want to touch that. But you do -- you would -- you would like to see him maybe go into the education of the high schools and controlling these companies from advertising?

PARSCALE: Yes, look, I think -- I think we always as adults have to protect our children. But yes, I also don't think that -- you know, I think protecting personal freedom is very important.

And it's why -- you know when I -- when I got into this -- I was in politics before this, when I started seeing the Democrats just want to tell us how we live, what we do, everything -- they control it (ph) because they're smarter than us.

I just knew that President Trump was the right person was the right person to make sure that we're protected. And he's going to do that. He's going to protect our Second Amendment also.

KILMEADE: Brad Parscale in charge of Trump 2020 has been working extremely hard with some very unique, cutting-edge ways of doing it.

Number one is setting up a monster list of anyone who's ever gone to a rally or expressed interest. They're on his tweet list or his text list.

PARSCALE: Yes.

KILMEADE: So Brad, guns is a dicey issue, and I understand there's some friction in the House -- within the White House in that the suburban moms are now for the first time in favor of some type of legislation that might make their kids at school safer and their community safer. And we also know how much the NRA and gun rights Second Amendment means to Republicans.

Is there a sweet spot?

PARSCALE: Look, I mean that's something for the White House to talk about. I don't -- I'm not going to get into legislation with you.

But, like, I think that -- I think this electorate and the people who are going to come out and vote for Donald Trump just want to make sure that they don't start down a slippery slope of trying to remove their personal freedoms.

And I think the president's going to protect that at all costs. While at the same time --

KILMEADE: When you -- right.

PARSCALE: -- he wants to protect the -- I mean, he wants to protect children. He wants to do what's -- he wants to do it (ph) right.

KILMEADE: The emergence of Warren over Biden, does that make you happier?

PARSCALE: Look, I think -- I think Warren is -- I think Warren's continuing to rise. I think she's -- she will be the nominee, that -- I have said that for, I think, five months and people thought I was crazy.

And if you look at the trends, she continues to rise while he continues to fall. And I -- and I think this -- you know, the corruption of Hunter Biden and what happened with, you know, getting millions from China and Ukraine and everywhere else while his father is the vice president.

You know - the millions (ph) - the Biden's have made (ph) office is a corruptional -- take them down Democrat Party. I've always said he was never going to increase one point. He was only going to decrease.

Since -- since his announcement, he's never gone up one point. I think he's only gone down. And that's what Biden does every time he's ever run.

JIM CRAMER, CNBC: I don't what's going happen. Look, I've got to tell you, when you get off the desk and you talk to executives, they're more fearful of her winning.

I mean I've never heard anybody say look, she's got to be stopped, she's got to be stopped. I don't know. She's very - she keeps going up in the polls.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She's raised a ton of money.

PARSCALE: I 100 percent agree. Look, I think the president beats Warren handedly (ph).

But I think the progressive left, the Democrat Party, the establishment that's there -- whether that's in the actual votes or in the convention or whatever -- they want Warren to win.

This is what they want, they want a progressive woman to win, and I think that's where they're going. And I think that's what the party wants also.

I think Biden is being - he's going to be (ph) attacked from both sides.

KILMEADE: He is, and it looks like you want Warren to win too. Brad Parscale thanks for your dog walking time. We appreciate it.

""To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,"" the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

DNC RAISES THE BAR FOR CANDIDATES TO QUALIFY FOR NOVEMBER SHOWDOWN

The email, which was sent to the various presidential campaigns, was obtained by Fox News.

Twelve candidates in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls say they’ve reached the qualifying criteria to make the stage at the showdown, which will be held on the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. It is the fourth round of debates for Democrats this cycle.

Those candidates – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

WELD, WALSH, SWING AT TRUMP IN FIRST GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

No other presidential contenders appear likely to reach the thresholds to make the cut. To reach the stage, candidates need to hit at least 2 percent in four qualifying polls and contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors.

The debate is being hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – which had lower criteria to qualify – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. Ten candidates faced off on one night in this month’s third round debate, for which the thresholds were raised."

Asked Thursday night at a campaign event in New Hampshire whether the son or daughter of a vice president should have business dealings abroad, businessman Andrew Yang said, “It certainly has a bad look to it.”

“In my mind they can wait until the term is over before serving that term. And that's really the way it would be under my administration,” he added.

But Yang said Friday in an interview with Fox News that his comments the previous night were not an implicit criticism of Biden.

“If you look at when he was vice president, were there any rules against your family members being on the boards of foreign companies? I believe there were not. So nothing was amiss,” he said.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet – in a interview published Thursday by Politico – said, ""I think it’d be better not to have that kind of arrangement.”

But Bennet said the issue of Biden and his son Hunter paled in comparison to what Trump did in a July phone call with Ukraine’s president.

“I think it is distracting us from where we should be focused, which is on Donald Trump's calling up a foreign leader and tell him to investigate one of his political opponents. No matter what Hunter Biden did, it is hard for me to imagine that it's not 1 million times more benign than that,” Bennet emphasized.

WARREN SAYS SHE WOULDN'T LET THE CHILD OF HER VP SIT ON A FOREIGN COMPANY'S BOARD

On Wednesday, one of Biden's top rivals, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, quickly answered “no” when asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on a foreign firm's board.

Still, to date, none of the Democratic presidential candidates have played into the president’s playbook of trying to turn the tables on Biden over his son's work.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Questions have been raised by Republicans over how Biden pushed as vice president in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – as a matter of record, he had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office by other nations – was later dismissed.

Trump’s reelection campaign on Friday launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his actions.

GABBARD REVERSES COURSE, BACKS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Meanwhile, the entire field of Democratic presidential candidates is now fully supporting the House Democrats' move this week launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the Ukrainian scandal.

The final holdout in the record-setting roster of White House hopefuls – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – came on board on Friday."

On the roster: ‘Deserve’s got nothing to do with it’ - I’ll Tell You What: Not so impreachykeenment - Warren slips and swipes Biden on ethics - Issa to challenge Duncan Hunter - *ahem* They got trashed



‘DESERVE’S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT’

Let’s start with the precondition that we don’t care whether you think the investigation into President Trump’s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to prosecute his political rivals is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” grounds for immediate impeachment or something in between.



We care in the sense that we’re sure that you are sincere in your beliefs and we acknowledge your God-given right to feel and think the way you do. What we mean is that in order to discern what might happen next, such feelings are hindrances. It’s hard to clearly consider such outcomes when you think in terms of your own beliefs.



This note, for example, would be a poor source for Major League Baseball forecasting since it is our position that the St. Louis Cardinals not only will win it all but deserve to win it all.



As William Munny told Little Bill Daggett right before he blew his head off with a Spencer repeating rifle on a saloon floor: “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”



There are plenty of people who think that Bill Clinton unfairly beat the rap, and even some who still think Richard Nixon got a raw deal. If you flipped through the back pages of enough bibliographies, you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old Andy Johnson.



Woodrow Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke in his second term, with his wife acting as a kind of regent for his last 17 months in office but Congress took no action. Warren Harding’s administration – in particular his Interior and Justice departments – was a quagmire of corruption, but he was dead and buried before any of it came to light. Lyndon Johnson grievously abused the powers of office for political advantage but he never faced any repercussions.



The rightness or wrongness of a president’s actions are all but immaterial in these matters. Whether the supporters or detractors of the aforementioned men were correct or not was of no consequence.

Now, that’s not to say that the passionate partisan bawling that we’re all now being subjected to won’t have an effect on what eventually does happen.



Studies suggest that home field advantage in sports is not only real but quite possibly the result of referees showing favoritism because of “the social atmosphere in the stadium.” The same is true with allegations of presidential misconduct.



We’ve said it many times before, but it bears repeating: Impeachment is a political proposition, not a legal one. And the referees here are the undecided or persuadable voters not yet sure what to make of what’s happening.



But even if you want to be part of working the refs – screaming into the orc-filled chasms of Twitter or annoying friends and loved ones with forwarded emails and Facebook posts – you probably still want to be able to think clearly about where it goes from here.



And that’s what we intend to help you do in the days ahead. You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.



For the sake of everybody who is going to be out there fighting passionately for their side, whatever it is, we’ll do our best to not pick one.

TIME OUT: ONCE UPON A TIME…

NatGeo: “The brothers Grimm published what would become one of the most influential and famous collections of folklore in the world. Children’s and Household Tales (Kinder und Hausmärchen), later titled Grimm’s Fairy Tales, are childhood-defining stories. The Grimms, however, had curated the collection as an academic anthology for scholars of German culture, not as a collection of bedtime stories for young readers. Amid the political and social turbulence of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), as France conquered Germanic lands, Jacob and Wilhelm were driven by nationalism to highlight their homeland and heritage. They were inspired by German Romantic authors and philosophers who believed that the purest forms of culture, those that bonded a community, could be found in stories shared from generation to generation. Storytelling expressed the essence of German culture and recalled the spirit and basic values of its people. By excavating Germany’s oral traditions, the brothers urgently sought to ‘preserve them from vanishing . . . to be forever silent in the tumult of our times.’”

WARREN SLIPS AND SWIPES BIDEN ON ETHICS

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, ‘I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.’ But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, ‘no.’ When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: ‘I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.’”



More family woes for Biden - Politico: “Joe Biden’s brother told executives at a healthcare firm that the former vice president’s cancer initiative would promote their business, according to a participant in the conversation, who said the promise came as part of a pitch on behalf of potential investors in the firm. The allegation is the latest of many times Biden’s relatives have invoked the former vice president and his political clout to further their private business dealings. It is the first that involves the Biden Cancer Initiative, a project Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his post-White House life following the death of his son Beau. Biden’s brother, James, made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden’s business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records.”



Sanders gives supporters the stage in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “As a Democratic candidate for president, [Bernie] Sanders frequently pushes his policies pugnaciously, framing them as moral imperatives as much as practical matters. But in his recent four-day swing through Iowa, he balanced his high-volume sermons with stories from his supporters. … Respondents who watched the September televised debate, where Sanders — who approached the debate stage with his typical fervor, but with a hoarse rasp — were more likely to have an unfavorable view of him. The debate-stage Sanders, whose style is described by some, including one of his 2020 rivals, as ""yelling"", was less present in his late September Iowa swing, Instead, Sanders often gave up the microphone to let others speak. … At his Iowa events, some of the personal stories are arranged in advance. But others are organic — hearing the stories of others inspires Sanders supporters to tell their own.”



Biden leads the pack in Maryland - Goucher College: “The Goucher College Poll asked Maryland Democratic likely voters who they are currently planning to vote for in the Maryland Democratic presidential primary… Thirty-three percent of Maryland Democratic likely voters say they will vote for Joe Biden and 21 percent for Elizabeth Warren. Ten percent would vote for Bernie Sanders, 6 percent for Kamala Harris, and 5 percent for Pete Buttigieg. All other candidates earn support from 1 percent or fewer of voters. Fifteen percent have no preference or are undecided. …Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College [said,] ‘Democrats in Maryland are divided over whether they want a more moderate or progressive nominee and whether nominating a candidate who can defeat Trump or match their policy preferences is their top priority.’”



ISSA TO CHALLENGE DUNCAN HUNTER

NYT: “Darrell Issa, the former nine-term congressman from California, will try to return to Congress by challenging Representative Duncan Hunter, who was indicted last year, setting up a clash among two Trump allies for one of Republicans’ most endangered seats. Mr. Issa is expected to announce his challenge at a news conference on Thursday morning in the San Diego County district, according to two sources familiar with his decision. He had been publicly mulling for months whether to make a bid to return to Congress, and started an exploratory committee in August. ‘I have received such a tremendous outpouring of encouragement from supporters inside the district, and around the state and across the nation,’ Mr. Issa said in August in a statement posted to the committee’s website. Mr. Issa will likely bill himself to Republicans as a safer alternative than the incumbent.”



Michigan announces new automatic voter registration - MLive: “Michigan took a leap forward into the modern era by announcing new voter registration policies on National Voter Registration Day. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced [Tuesday] that automatic voter registration has officially launched in Michigan and online voter registration will be available following the November 2019 election. “Making voter registration automatic for eligible citizens means more Michigan residents will have access to participating in our democracy,” Benson said in a release. … Michigan joins 17 other states and the District of Columbia in enacting automatic voter registration.”

*AHEM* THEY GOT TRASHED

News24: “A South Korean mayor who dumped a ton of trash on a clean beach to give environmental campaigners something to pick up has said sorry for his deception. Officials trucked in litter and waste that had already been collected from rubbish-strewn coasts, and scattered it all over the pristine sand of southwest Jindo. The following day hundreds of volunteers scoured the shores and bagged up the garbage as part of an event to mark International Coastal Cleanup Day, a global event aimed at countering the scourge of sea-borne waste. ‘We brought in waste styrofoam and other coastal trash gathered from nearby areas so the 600 participants could carry out clean-up activities,’ said Lee Dong-jin, Jindo county mayor, in a statement. His office apologised for causing trouble and said the event was meant to ‘raise awareness about the seriousness of coastal waste.’”

DEMS LOOK TO STREAMLINE IMPEACHMENT PROBE

WaPo: “House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season. Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. The emerging strategy of a rapid investigation focused mainly on the accusation that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt about a political rival comes as lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a two-week recess. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-liner’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’”



Tim Alberta: Will impeachment shatter a badly broken Congress? - Politico: “On Monday, [Rep. Abigail Spanberger] joined with six like-minded freshman colleagues in penning a Washington Post op-ed calling for an impeachment inquiry—stunning the Democratic caucus and effectively forcing Pelosi’s hand. It would be the unlikeliest bunch of members, legislative pacifists who had labored not to be defined by opposition to Trump, leading Congress into an era-defining clash. How the impeachment proceedings affect an increasingly polarized nation is anyone’s guess. But it’s hard to imagine the coming showdown doing any more damage to an institution that, lawmakers in both parties will agree, was broken long before Donald Trump came to town.”



Snap poll shows impeachment supporters outnumber opponents - PBS: “Americans are split over whether they support an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Forty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, while 46 percent of Americans said they disapproved, and 5 percent remained unsure, according to the poll. … Eighty-eight percent of Democrats agreed with the inquiry, along with 44 percent of independent voters, but among Republicans, support was drastically lower, at 6 percent. … This latest poll was conducted the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry…”



Kraushaar: Politics of impeachment now favor Democrats - National Journal: “The politics of impeachment is changing, rapidly. No one knows how this will end, but all signs are pointing to growing trouble for Republicans. The whistleblower’s well-documented allegation that Trump extorted Ukraine, an ally, for political gain is damning and direct. House Democrats are narrowly focused on digging deeper into the explosive evidence as the basis for impeachment. Administration officials connected to the alleged cover-up will be subpoenaed under oath before Congress as part of the impeachment hearings. If the White House thinks things will get better for them, they’re fooling themselves. … The larger reality is that public opinion is more fluid than anyone expected last week. Many anti-Trump pundits, expecting a repeat of our predictable tribal political realities, assumed that nothing has changed. But our politics has become so partisan that even rapid short-term movement suggests something is happening.”



Andrew Cuomo mocks ‘leftist,’ ‘unproductive’ impeachment effort - New York Daily News: “Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized ‘leftist’ Democrats for pushing Congress into launching an impeachment inquiry of President Trump and predicted the probe would lead to government gridlock. The governor derided the ‘quote unquote inquiry’ as the work of angry radicals who forced the hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to mount what he suggested would ultimately be an exercise in futility. ‘There is a heightened leftist component of the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure from,’ Cuomo said. The governor ticked off a list of legislative priorities that would likely languish until after the 2020 elections now that he said Democrats will be focused on removing Trump from power. ‘It’s a long and unproductive road,’ Cuomo said. ‘Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere.’”



TEAM TRUMP LEANS ON MUELLER MOVES

AP: “The White House is dusting off its playbook from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Caught off guard by the speed at which a whistleblower’s claims have morphed into an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and his team are scrambling to respond. They’re turning, at least for now, to some of the same strategies they used to counter special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The basic tactics deployed by the short-staffed White House: Attempt to discredit government officials at the heart of the story. Dispatch Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies to muddy the picture. Lean on Republicans in Congress to provide cover.”



Amy Walter: Impeachment won’t change the game - Cook Political Report: “We are a deeply divided, deeply polarized country. Almost everything we do — from choosing where to eat lunch (Chick-fil-A vs. Whole Foods), to picking where to live (urban/suburban vs. rural/small town) is filtered through the lens of how we identify politically. As such, we shouldn't expect views of impeachment to be any different. Opinions won't swing wildly from day to day or week to week. We also shouldn't expect to see Americans overwhelming support or overwhelmingly oppose impeachment. Like everything in this era, the final verdict on impeachment is likely to be decided on the margins by voters who are holding conflicting views on the president and the process of impeachment. It will be decided by those who may dislike Trump, but are also frustrated by the paralysis in Washington, or those who may like the agenda of the president, but are troubled by his behavior.”



Romney’s narrow road - NYT: “Mr. [Mitt] Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side. It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Mr. Trump’s re-election and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.”



First GOP governors come out in support of impeachment inquiry - WaPo: “For the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.”

TIME OUT: MAN, HOLES

USA Today: “NASA has given us another historic glimpse into the wonders of space after releasing a video that shows a star-shredding black hole in a galaxy millions of light-years away. The amazing footage of the ‘cataclysmic phenomenon’ was taken by NASA’s planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Astronomers think the supermassive black hole weighs around 6 million times the sun’s mass and is located about 375 million light-years away in a galaxy of similar size to the Milky Way, NASA said. The incredible event, called a tidal disruption, is very rare and occurs once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in galaxies like the Milky Way. When a star gets too close, the intense tides of a black hole break apart the star into a stream of gas, according to NASA. As shown in the video, the tail of that stream breaks away from the black hole while other parts of it swing back around and create a halo of debris.”

JOE = JEB? BIDEN BENEFACTORS READY TO MOBILIZE MEGA PAC

NYT: “Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act.”



Under fire, Biden looks to scamper left - WaPo: “Advisers to presidential candidate Joe Biden are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the discussions, as the former vice president now stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a multitrillion-dollar ‘wealth tax’ on the richest Americans. The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each unveiled their own plans to impose a ‘wealth tax’ on multimillionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates. Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.”



Wall Street Democratic donors lay down the law on Warren - CNBC: “Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders.”



A dozen candidates, one night for next Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee intends to hold its fourth presidential primary debate on one night in October, packing the stage with as many as 12 qualified candidates. ‘To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,’ the DNC wrote in an email to campaigns on Friday.”

A LITTLE ON THE NOSE, DON’T YOU THINK?

WABC: “Officials in New Jersey are looking into multiple complaints of a mystery odor that smells like rotten fish. The Hudson Regional Health Commission said they received two complaints in Jersey City and several complaints in Bayonne on Tuesday night. The HRHC confirmed a presence of an odor, but said the source could not be traced. Inspectors went into Newark - specifically to Raymound Boulevard and Doremus Avenue, because winds were coming from that direction. They were not successful in locating the origin. ‘It's not anything were used to around here. Being a peninsula, we have water on three sides and sometimes at low tide that you can smell the bay. It was really nothing like that. It was a very nasty, almost like a foul meat type of smell,’ OEM Coordinator Edoardo Ferrante said. The New Jersey DEP has been investigating the same odor since the beginning of summer.”

“But there is one area in which as a father I do feel a great weight of responsibility, a need to measure every word. It is not in the realm of character building, but in the realm of truth imparting.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, 1990.

Rosenhaus explained on Warren Sapp’s “99 Problems” podcast that Brown’s abrupt “retirement” from the league was premature and that he believes Brown still wants to play in the league.

ANTONIO BROWN ATTENDS DEPOSITION IN CONDO-TRASHING CASE; FOOTAGE SHOWS FURNITURE RAINING DOWN ON COMPLEX POOL

“I believe that Antonio wants to continue his career in the NFL and I’ve mentioned that. I have had discussions with a few teams that are very interested in him and want to know about his future and what’s going on with the NFL,” Rosenhaus said. “Hopefully, when that is all resolved, Antonio will be able to continue his Hall of Fame career. That’s really where our focus is.”

Brown was released by the New England Patriots after one game and just 11 days with the team. He was accused of sexual assault and rape in a civil lawsuit filed in Florida, and a separate sexual assault and allegation surfaced in a report in Sports Illustrated last week. Brown was released after that report.

ANTONIO BROWN BACK TO SCHOOL AT CENTRAL MICHIGAN AFTER PATRIOTS RELEASE

Meanwhile, Brown announced he was taking classes at Central Michigan University and appeared at a deposition hearing over a furniture-throwing case. Rosenhaus said he encourages all his clients to finish their degrees or receive a post-graduate degree and that Brown taking the classes doesn’t mean the wide receiver is finished with football completely.

“I know there’s been a lot of speculation as to whether or not that means he’s not going to proceed with the NFL but taking online college courses to get your degree or your post-graduate degree is something that I would recommend to every client. I wouldn’t read too much into that,” he said.

He added: “Obviously, it’s a very difficult time for him not playing. We expected him to be playing against the Jets on Sunday. So it’s tough. It’s tough for someone who loves the game not to be playing right now and the hope is that we will cooperate with the NFL and their investigation and get him back with a team to continue this tremendous career that he’s had.”

Rosenhaus didn’t specify how many teams have shown interest in Brown since his release. A source told Pro Football Talk that at least three teams had shown interest."

As manager Scott Servais took the ball from Hernandez, the fireballer received a standing ovation from the fans he dazzled for more than a decade. Servais told Hernandez before he left the bump: “You will always be the king in this town.”

Hernadez’s emotions got the better of him as he got back to the dugout.

“I didn't want to just give up five runs in five innings. I wanted to go out there and do my job and just give the team a chance to win,” he said after the game. “That was a fun night.”

Aside from Hall of Famers like Ken Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martinez, Hernandez has been one of the most recognizable and notable Mariners to play for the club.

“I was walking to the bullpen and my eyes started to [get] wet and I was like, 'Not right now.' It's hard to do it,” he said. “There were a lot of emotions out there. I've been here for 15 years, and there is a lot of stuff going on.”

Hernandez, 33, celebrated with fans in the “King’s Court” cheering section after the game.

While Hernandez intends to retire from baseball, he said will depend on whether he gets an acceptable offer.

“Law & Order: SVU” star Ice-T, who plays the fan-favorite Fin Tutula on the legendary ""ripped from the headlines"" crime drama, said that this season, fans will see an allusion to the saga of former “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett that played out in the news earlier this year.

ICE-T CALLS OUT AMAZON AFTER HE 'ALMOST SHOT' ONE OF THE COMPANY'S DELIVERY DRIVERS

“I mean, I don’t know what I can say,” the 61-year-old actor told Us Weekly on Wednesday at “History Is Made: Law & Order: SVU Celebrates a Milestone” at the Paley Center for Media. “I can give you some hints.”

The rapper said an “Empire-ish drama” would somehow seep into a Season 21 episode, but not before the gang adjusts to new roles within the district attorney’s office.

Smollett made national and world headlines in January when he filed a police report alleging that two masked men attacked him, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him. Smollett, who is black and openly gay, claimed the men made racist and homophobic comments and yelled, “This is MAGA country,"" a pointed reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

After an intense investigation, police said Smollett had staged the entire episode to drum up publicity for his career. Smollett, who was dropped from ""Empire,"" has strongly denied the accusations.

ICE-T SAYS HE'S NEVER EATEN A BAGEL IN HIS LIFE

Showrunners said the entire cast will be making major adjustments following the season premiere.

IN CROWDED DEMOCRATIC 2020 FIELD, CANDIDATES ARE MEETING WITH GROUPS WHO HOLD CLOUT

“My roommate didn’t know that I was anything besides an active-duty lieutenant,"" the candidate recalled as his bus made its way to Boone, Iowa during a four-day tour of central and eastern Iowa.

But once his fellow service members found out, he said, ""they would start calling me the honorable lieutenant.""

Five years ago, Buttigieg was among the rank and file of the United States military. Now he’s on a bus in Iowa trying to win over voters and distinguish himself in a crowded field of Democrats running for president.

“I think of a lot of them think it’s funny that someone they know is running for president,” Buttigieg said of those he served with in Afghanistan. “They’ve been encouraging.""

He added: ""I mean a lot of them are more politically conservative than I am, but they are supportive.”

Buttigieg decided to take a page from former Republican presidential candidate John McCain’s playbook by emulating the Arizona senator's famous “Straight Talk Express” bus tours -- in which he traveled with members of the media and opened himself up to questions on any topic.

It was Buttigieg’s first cup of coffee Sunday morning when he began comparing politics to football.

“I think football provides the most analogies for politics, he said. ""You’re protecting the quarterback but it’s not all about the quarterback -- because if you forget the importance of the line ,you’re in trouble.""

The campaign and reporters traveled to nine cities in four days on the Premiere Transportation coach that former President Barack Obama, legendary director Steven Spielberg, Sen. Mitt Romney, and entertainers Steve Harvey and Justin Timberlake have used. President Trump also rode on the bus at one point, according to Premiere Transportation staff.

It wasn’t typical bus seating.

The furniture allowed Buttigieg to look reporters in the eye. The bus was equipped with Wi-Fi for the press to file stories, and a flat-screen television, which allowed Buttigieg to keep an eye on football and the news. Also installed: a counter full of snacks, including chocolate chip cookies, protein bars, chips, gummy bears and coffee.

“I like sliced pickles, but other than that, my snack choices are pretty basic. I like beef jerky,” he said.

When he wasn't talking to reporters, Buttigieg was trying to make contact with Iowa voters.

“I looked at all the presidential [candidates] and I put a chart out,"" Amani Latimer, a Wisconsin voter and founder of Mamas 4 Pete, said after Buttigieg’s meet-and-greet in Dubuque. “I was, like, all over analytics, and I said this guy gets it.”

“I think he would make a great president, I mean he so’s smart,” Iowa caucusgoer Lindra Bicksler said after a campaign rally in Clinton. “He speaks seven languages and would be able to talk to leaders of other countries himself.”

While the yellow and blue bus rolled through rural Iowa, Buttigieg took a moment from talking with reporters to pull out his phone and look at the latest polls from The Des Moines Register and CNN. They put him fourth behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Oh, it’s a four-way race,” Buttigieg said.

Buttigieg said the bus tour is just one part of his strategy of connecting with voters in smaller communities, who he says are key to the Dem nomination.

“I’m not too worried about a variation like that, especially in a moment when only one in five people say they’ve made up their mind,” he said. “I think the important thing is that people know you, know what you’re about, do they like what they see -- and we’re seeing a lot of encouragement on that front.”

As voters prepare for the first-in-the-nation caucus and the first primary in New Hampshire, Buttigieg said his campaign has plans to step up outreach to voters. The bus may next head for the Granite State."

'The Contract' was a plank of popular proposals that the Republicans pledged to pursue if the voters put them in power. Plus, it came with a caveat -- if the new Republican majority didn't follow through, then the voters should kick them out of office.

NEWT GINGRICH: SPEAKER PELOSI: THIS IS THE INVESTIGATION CONGRESS NEEDS TO DO RIGHT NOW

""The Contract gave people something worth voting for. We pledged that if you voted Republican in the 1994 election we would bring 10 points of supporting legislation to the House floor. If these legislative policies appeal to you the only way to get them is to vote Republican,"" said Gingrich in Fox Nation's new series ""Inside the Contract With America.""

A few weeks after Gingrich's gamble, Republicans won enough seats in the 1994 midterm elections to secure a majority in the House of Representatives -- overturning 40 years of Democratic-control.

'The Contract' was a revolutionary idea and it is credited with contributing to one of the most dramatic political events in American history -- the Republican Revolution. It included some proposals that were realized such as welfare reform -- and to an extent -- term limits, and others than were not such as the balanced budget.

EXPERTS SAYS CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT WAS POLITICAL BLUNDER FOR REPUBLICANS

Liberal criticism of 'The Contract' started almost immediately.

""The Democrats played into it, they attacked it. They helped us make it a news story,"" former Republican National Committee chairman and 2017 Virginia gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie told Fox Nation.

In fact, shortly after the 1994 midterm election, Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., went on CSPAN to offer a progressive response.

""The Contract is a fraud. We think that the more the American people understand what is in the contract, which essentially amounts to very large tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country, the eventual destruction of social security, major slashes in Medicare and Medicaid, increasing military spending and cutting back on nutrition programs for hungry children and for needy senior citizens, I think as people understand what is in the contract I think they will begin to reject it,"" said Sen. Sanders.

Gingrich came up with the idea of reaching around the media to communicate directly with the American electorate and that plan included putting an advertisement in the TV Guide.

""We're in Annapolis, I think in the Spring of '94. [Former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour] and I go to an old bar that's in a Federalist era building right across from the state capital. Down in the basement. And we're sitting there talking,"" remembered Gingrich in the Fox Nation show.

Barbour recalled that he walked into this meeting without being clear on what it was all about.

""Newt's big idea was we're gonna put an ad in TV Guide. The idea was we're gonna put an insert in there about 'Contract with America'. And the message is, if you elect Republicans to run the House of Representatives if we win the House of Representative this is what we pledge we'll do,"" Barbour said.

The advertisment was printed on a page of the TV Guide that was designed to be torn out and used as a checklist to hold their elected representatives accountable.

""Here's our 10 things, tear this out of your TV Guide, post it up on your refrigerator, and as we do 'em check 'em off, done, done, done. And within a hundred days, if you don't have 10 check marks we don't deserve to be reelected,"" said Barry Johnson, former Executive Director of 'Contract with America.'

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Fox News contributor Liz Peek said that lawmakers should learn from the history of the 'Republican Revolution.'

""The American people are commonsensical... I actually think that in our political world today we underestimate the value of promising good governence and those aren't policies -- that's values,"" she said.

FOX NEWS HOSTS ON DEMS' IMPEACHMENT PUSH

Wall Street Journal Editorial Page member Bill McGurn agreed, ""They picked issues -- unlike Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren picking some of these issues that have no support -- they looked and said 'Where are the American people aligned most strongly with Republican principals.'""

Reflecting back on the selling of the 'Contract with America', Johnson told Fox Nation that it was a smashing success, ""[I]t got to the point where one of the industry magazines, 'Advertising Age' puts out an annual issue naming their top marketing campaigns of the year. 'The Contract with America' was the top marketing campaign of the year, and the front cover of Advertising Age had this picture of Newt and I standing on the Speaker's balcony and they did an interview with us and everything. That's just one of those little weird things that happened out of 'The Contract.'""

Researchers from security firm Cisco Talos reported this week that the website, Hire Military Heroes, was distributing malware that allows hackers to gain control of the victim’s computer, as reported by Bleeping Computer.

An interesting twist is that the hackers may also be targeting active servicemen and not just veterans, according to ZDNet, which cites that Iran may be behind the attack.

BEWARE OF CREEPY 'SIM SWAP' FRAUD THAT LETS HACKERS TAKE OVER YOUR PHONE AND STEAL YOUR MONEY

A cybersecurity analyst from the Department of Homeland Security, speaking on background, told ZDNet that the attackers are aiming at military networks.

""They [the hackers] are hoping that one of their targets would use a DOD system to download and run the malware,"" the analyst told the news outlet. ""Chances are low, but it's worth a shot…Pretty clever approach, if I can say so,” the analyst added, referring to the Department of Defense.

Fox News has reached out to Cisco regarding Iran's reported involvement with the hack.

The bad actor had been previously identified by Symantec as Tortoiseshell, a group behind a previous attack on an IT provider in Saudi Arabia, according to Cisco Talos.

The fake veterans website has three links to download a desktop app for free — but the app is actually a fake installer. When the fake installer starts, the progress bar almost fills up entirely and then displays an error message.

“The installer checks if Google is reachable. If not, the installation stops. If it is reachable, the installer downloads two binaries [files],” according to Cisco Talos.

CHINESE CYBER HACKERS HAVE BUILT A BACKDOOR IN US-CHINA TRADE WAR, REPORT SAYS

One of the binary files is used to perform “reconnaissance” on the system and the second is the Remote Administrative Tool.

“The attacker retrieves information such as the date, time and drivers,"" Cisco Talos researchers wrote in the report. ""The attacker can then see information on the system, the patch level, the number of processors, the network configuration, the hardware, firmware versions, the domain controller, the name of the admin, the list of the account, etc. This is a significant amount of information relating to a machine and makes the attacker well-prepared to carry out additional attacks.”

Both the amount and the kind of information that is targeted makes the attacks particularly dangerous, Warren Mercer, a researcher at Cisco Talos, told Fox News.

“When you focus on the agenda of the attackers, it’s unlikely to be a garden variety attack…they certainly wanted something much more meaningful than your cat pictures,” Mercer said.

Mercer added that it’s difficult to assess the effectiveness of this attack since it was discovered before the operation went into high gear. “We did not identify any ‘in-the-wild’ activity associated and since our publication, the threat actor’s website is now unavailable.”

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., were sexist if they kept supporting him over Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

""I actually overheard someone saying -- that I thought was an interesting point -- that basically at this point if you are still supporting Sanders as opposed to Warren, it's kind of showing your sexism because she has more detailed plans and her plans have evolved,"" strategist Emily Tisch Sussman said on Monday.

""I thought it was an interesting point and I think there might be something to it,"" she added while speaking on ""MSNBC Live.""

Her comments came as new polls showed Warren beating both Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the Democratic primary calendar. Sanders and Warren have been portrayed as the standard-bearers for the Democrats' far-left wing.

SANDERS VS. WARREN: PROGRESSIVE CONTENDERS SPLIT ENDORSEMENT OF KEY CALIFORNIA UNION

Sussman indicated that Sanders' candidacy was a lost cause, telling MSNBC host Craig Melvin that Warren was taking voters from Sanders and that the Vermont senator had ""peaked"" in the race.

""What we're seeing of his supporters -- there's a ceiling. There is nowhere to go -- there is no up to go,"" she added.

Nina Turner, who co-chairs Sanders' campaign, called Sussman's comments ""foolishness."" ""I’m truly trying to wrap my mind around this foolishness,"" she tweeted early Saturday, alongside an annoyed emoji.

Other women responded on Twitter Saturday, citing Sanders' support for various economic policies -- many of which Warren herself has backed.

""Not here to be vote shamed by the 1 [percent],"" Amy Vilela, the Nevada co-chair for Sanders' campaign, said. ""I am supporting the only candidate who will always put the needs of people first.""

Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) purchased drinks from two girls running a lemonade stand in August, she may not have been aware that her $10 purchase would be donated to a pro-life charity.

""Our daughters thought [Warren] was nice,"" Dan Michels, a Trump supporter and a father to one of the girls, told the Washington Free Beacon. ""She came by and told us we should vote for her. And our daughters told us she was a nice person, but we don't align with her politically and … because she's pro-choice, we said we should donate her money to a pro-life [cause].""

On August 8, Warren stopped by a lemonade stand staffed by two 11-year-old children, Sienna Michels and Audrey Billings, during a campaign bus tour across Iowa.

""Stopped for a quick drink at a lemonade stand in Harlan, Iowa. When life gives you lemons, make big structural change!"" Warren said on Twitter.

The two kids were excited about meeting a presidential candidate in person. The Michels girl urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020 after the photo op. The parents instead explained Warren's stance on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to donate to the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, a non-profit that supports pro-life legislation.

""My daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her,"" Michels said. ""We talked about the abortion part of things and said maybe we should donate money to stop abortion, and my daughter was all for that.""

""Senator Warren was on here last week and I asked her about her plans for Medicare-for-all and I'm going to ask you the question that I asked her... at the risk of being accused of trumpeting Republican talking points,"" Colbert warned Sanders. ""Is there an increase in taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare-for-all, or rather, where would the tax burden go to pay for that?""

""Under my legislation... nobody in America will pay any more premiums,"" Sanders responded. ""No more co-payments, gone. No more out-of-pocket expenses, gone. Nobody will go bankrupt... because of medical bills, that is gone. Nobody in America under my bill will pay more than $200 a year in total for their prescription drugs.""

""Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not,"" the 2020 hopeful continued. ""So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person's income... Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes.""

ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS SHE WOULDN'T ALLOW THE CHILD OF HER VP TO SIT ON FOREIGN COMPANY BOARD

Last week, Colbert attempted to ask Warren the same question, but struggled to get a direct answer from her.

“You keep being asked in the debates how are you going to pay for it, are you going to be raising the middle-class taxes… How are you going to pay for it? Are you going to be raising the middle-class taxes?” Colbert asked.

“So, here’s how we’re going to do this,” Warren responded. “Costs are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations… and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down.”

“But will their taxes go up?” Colbert pressed.

“But, here’s the thing,” Warren said.

“But, here’s the thing,” Colbert grinningly interrupted. “I’ve listened to these answers a few times before and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence.”

He continued by sharing his “parallel suggestion”: “Isn’t Medicare-for-all like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren’t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?”"

Full transcript below

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: And that is the president of the United States talking about the push for impeachment, there's inquiry on it (ph) right now. The story's raging on all these channels. And Brad Parscale, the man in charge of taking this information, the current state of the economy and the country, and getting the president four more years.

He is in charge of the Trump 2020 reelection campaign and he's walking his dog. So we're going to hear a slice of Brad Parscale's life as well as his profession.

Brad, thanks so much for doing this.

BRAD PARSCALE, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN: Hey, Brian. How are you, bud?

KILMEADE: Good, good. So everyone's talking about the Democrats, they're energized because of this impeachment inquiry and what happened yesterday.

What has it done for Trump 2020?

PARSCALE: Well, I mean, I think one of the most amazing things is just the fundraising we've had in the last 48 hours. I mean, as soon as they -- they started this attack, I think Americans, and -- and Republicans, and supporters of the president all over the country, they started voting with their wallet.

And you know, this is the one thing they can do right now. They can donate. And we've had just thousands and thousands and nearly millions of dollars in donations come in (ph). Sometimes -- many first-time donors. To just see the hypocrisy and the things they're doing right now, and they're upset that their vote is being stolen.

KILMEADE: You know, there was a sense that the more you pushed on the -- if you pushed for impeachment after the Mueller probe, it was good for the president.

But this is something brand new, it's -- everything's happening quicker, maybe it's more understandable.

Does that worry you?

PARSCALE: No, I'm not worried at all. I'm actually -- if you -- if you saw my statements, I'm pretty confident.

Look, the president was sent there from the people to actually deal with this kind of, you know, corruption and to -- and to fight the swamp, and that's what he's doing.

He's doing exactly what the people sent him there to do. And I think -- I don't think one American is going punish him for that.

And the Democrats just know they can't beat him in 2020, so they want to try to use anything they can and lie and cheat to defeat it.

KILMEADE: And that is proof that you did tell the truth. You are walking your dog and he seemed to be startled by something.

PARSCALE: Yes.

(LAUGHTER)

KILMEADE: We'll cover that story, get a correspondent on it.

A couple other things, how close -- have you been in touch with the president?

I will tell you my observation. He had an unbelievably productive United Nations series of meetings.

I know international relations don't usually mean poll numbers, but I think he was really disheartened in his final press conference. He was as subdued as I've (ph) seen him.

I know you could easily say I'm wrong, but you know him as well as anybody. Could you give insight (ph) --

PARSCALE: Yes.

KILMEADE: Can you give me his mindset?

PARSCALE: So I think, first of all -- I mean, like -- you know, I think, like, Merkel and some of these people only did like two or three bilaterals.

I mean, this is how hard the president is working. He's, like, doing 10 -- 11, I think in one day. I mean, he -- he wants to do three times as much as anybody else, plus one.

And that's -- that's just his mindset. I've known him for so long. He always wants to do a little more. There's always more I can do today.

I talked about this from the last rallies, the last days of the 2016 election to U.N. meetings, he's a fighter and he wants to do more.

Look, I don't think he's -- I don't think he's stepped (ph) one step back from this.

He's -- as you saw yesterday in his -- in his -- in his press conference -- hey, sorry -- in his press conference that he's ready to fight.

And he wants to -- he wants to -- he wants to support the American people. Sorry. We're walking by a dog.

KILMEADE: No, I understand. What kind of dog do you have?

PARSCALE: I have -- I have two Labradoodles. My wife picked them out. They're like -- but (ph) they're labs and they just -- they're funny dogs.

KILMEADE: Right. I mean, did you hear the creator of the Labradoodle feels as though they created Frankenstein and they regret doing it?

(LAUGHTER)

PARSCALE: No, they're good dogs. One of them is 9-months-old though, so he gets a little frisky when he walks by dogs.

KILMEADE: The president's got an agenda left.

Number one, the USMCA, he's looking at some type of gun legislation. He -- the White House reached out to Senator Murphy.

He also -- there's talk about doing something on the vaping with the new revelations, and the -- and the 12 deaths and the 400 who've been sickened.

What -- what do you want him -- just from a pure pollster perspective, what do you want to see him tackle?

PARSCALE: Yes, look, I think one thing everybody needs to understand with this president, he's about personal freedom. You know, like he's going to -- he's going to protect the Second Amendment. He's always going to do that.

He's going to protect the personal freedom of you to -- you know, to vape. I think those are things that he wants. He wants to make sure -- but he also cares about people's safety and children. And I think he's -- he's bothered personally by, you know, some of the young people that have been affected by this.

But overall, everything about him is about personal freedom. And we're the party of freedom. And the other party wants to take things away and control what you can and can't do, from -- even if that's a plastic straw in your -- in your drink.

They want to tell you how to live -- they want -- how much sugar you can have, everything else.

We believe that -- and I -- and I truly believe the Republican Party is the party of freedom.

KILMEADE: So you think cracking down with kids under 18, but letting people do what they want to do. Whether it's chewing tobacco, smoking, smoking cigars, you don't want to touch that. But you do -- you would -- you would like to see him maybe go into the education of the high schools and controlling these companies from advertising?

PARSCALE: Yes, look, I think -- I think we always as adults have to protect our children. But yes, I also don't think that -- you know, I think protecting personal freedom is very important.

And it's why -- you know when I -- when I got into this -- I was in politics before this, when I started seeing the Democrats just want to tell us how we live, what we do, everything -- they control it (ph) because they're smarter than us.

I just knew that President Trump was the right person was the right person to make sure that we're protected. And he's going to do that. He's going to protect our Second Amendment also.

KILMEADE: Brad Parscale in charge of Trump 2020 has been working extremely hard with some very unique, cutting-edge ways of doing it.

Number one is setting up a monster list of anyone who's ever gone to a rally or expressed interest. They're on his tweet list or his text list.

PARSCALE: Yes.

KILMEADE: So Brad, guns is a dicey issue, and I understand there's some friction in the House -- within the White House in that the suburban moms are now for the first time in favor of some type of legislation that might make their kids at school safer and their community safer. And we also know how much the NRA and gun rights Second Amendment means to Republicans.

Is there a sweet spot?

PARSCALE: Look, I mean that's something for the White House to talk about. I don't -- I'm not going to get into legislation with you.

But, like, I think that -- I think this electorate and the people who are going to come out and vote for Donald Trump just want to make sure that they don't start down a slippery slope of trying to remove their personal freedoms.

And I think the president's going to protect that at all costs. While at the same time --

KILMEADE: When you -- right.

PARSCALE: -- he wants to protect the -- I mean, he wants to protect children. He wants to do what's -- he wants to do it (ph) right.

And doing what Beto wants to do and come take guns is the craziest thing ever. And that's not how we make our -- our world safer. That's just -- that's just psychotic talk.

KILMEADE: The emergence of Warren over Biden, does that make you happier?

PARSCALE: Look, I think -- I think Warren is -- I think Warren's continuing to rise. I think she's -- she will be the nominee, that -- I have said that for, I think, five months and people thought I was crazy.

And if you look at the trends, she continues to rise while he continues to fall. And I -- and I think this -- you know, the corruption of Hunter Biden and what happened with, you know, getting millions from China and Ukraine and everywhere else while his father is the vice president.

You know - the millions (ph) - the Biden's have made (ph) office is a corruptional -- take them down Democrat Party. I've always said he was never going to increase one point. He was only going to decrease.

Since -- since his announcement, he's never gone up one point. I think he's only gone down. And that's what Biden does every time he's ever run.

(CROSSTALK)

KILMEADE: I want you to hear what Jim Cramer said yesterday on CNBC about Elizabeth Warren, cut 41.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think Elizabeth Warren pushes banks into - they were already down 20 percent from behind (ph).

JIM CRAMER, CNBC: I don't what's going happen. Look, I've got to tell you, when you get off the desk and you talk to executives, they're more fearful of her winning.

I mean I've never heard anybody say look, she's got to be stopped, she's got to be stopped. I don't know. She's very - she keeps going up in the polls.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She's raised a ton of money.

CRAMER: She's going to win Iowa I believe. She's a very compelling figure on the stump (ph).

(END AUDIO CLIP)

KILMEADE: And she (ph) -- said he went on to say that if he wins he has people that (ph) go to - they're going to vote Trump that normally would not. That's how much --

PARSCALE: I 100 percent agree. Look, I think the president beats Warren handedly (ph).

But I think the progressive left, the Democrat Party, the establishment that's there -- whether that's in the actual votes or in the convention or whatever -- they want Warren to win.

This is what they want, they want a progressive woman to win, and I think that's where they're going. And I think that's what the party wants also.

I think Biden is being - he's going to be (ph) attacked from both sides.

KILMEADE: He is, and it looks like you want Warren to win too. Brad Parscale thanks for your dog walking time. We appreciate it.

PARSCALE: Thank you buddy (ph).

DNC RAISES THE BAR FOR CANDIDATES TO QUALIFY FOR NOVEMBER SHOWDOWN

The email, which was sent to the various presidential campaigns, was obtained by Fox News.

Twelve candidates in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls say they’ve reached the qualifying criteria to make the stage at the showdown, which will be held on the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. It is the fourth round of debates for Democrats this cycle.

Those candidates – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

WELD, WALSH, SWING AT TRUMP IN FIRST GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

No other presidential contenders appear likely to reach the thresholds to make the cut. To reach the stage, candidates need to hit at least 2 percent in four qualifying polls and contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors.

The debate is being hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – which had lower criteria to qualify – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. Ten candidates faced off on one night in this month’s third round debate, for which the thresholds were raised."

Asked Thursday night at a campaign event in New Hampshire whether the son or daughter of a vice president should have business dealings abroad, businessman Andrew Yang said, “It certainly has a bad look to it.”

“In my mind they can wait until the term is over before serving that term. And that's really the way it would be under my administration,” he added.

But Yang said Friday in an interview with Fox News that his comments the previous night were not an implicit criticism of Biden.

“If you look at when he was vice president, were there any rules against your family members being on the boards of foreign companies? I believe there were not. So nothing was amiss,” he said.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet – in a interview published Thursday by Politico – said, ""I think it’d be better not to have that kind of arrangement.”

But Bennet said the issue of Biden and his son Hunter paled in comparison to what Trump did in a July phone call with Ukraine’s president.

“I think it is distracting us from where we should be focused, which is on Donald Trump's calling up a foreign leader and tell him to investigate one of his political opponents. No matter what Hunter Biden did, it is hard for me to imagine that it's not 1 million times more benign than that,” Bennet emphasized.

WARREN SAYS SHE WOULDN'T LET THE CHILD OF HER VP SIT ON A FOREIGN COMPANY'S BOARD

On Wednesday, one of Biden's top rivals, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, quickly answered “no” when asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on a foreign firm's board.

Still, to date, none of the Democratic presidential candidates have played into the president’s playbook of trying to turn the tables on Biden over his son's work.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Questions have been raised by Republicans over how Biden pushed as vice president in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – as a matter of record, he had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office by other nations – was later dismissed.

Trump’s reelection campaign on Friday launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his actions.

GABBARD REVERSES COURSE, BACKS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Meanwhile, the entire field of Democratic presidential candidates is now fully supporting the House Democrats' move this week launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the Ukrainian scandal.

The final holdout in the record-setting roster of White House hopefuls – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – came on board on Friday."

On the roster: Dems look to streamline impeachment probe - Team Trump leans on Mueller moves - Joe = Jeb? Biden benefactors ready to mobilize mega PAC - A little on the nose, don’t you think?



DEMS LOOK TO STREAMLINE IMPEACHMENT PROBE

WaPo: “House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season. Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. The emerging strategy of a rapid investigation focused mainly on the accusation that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt about a political rival comes as lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a two-week recess. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-liner’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’”



Tim Alberta: Will impeachment shatter a badly broken Congress? - Politico: “On Monday, [Rep. Abigail Spanberger] joined with six like-minded freshman colleagues in penning a Washington Post op-ed calling for an impeachment inquiry—stunning the Democratic caucus and effectively forcing Pelosi’s hand. It would be the unlikeliest bunch of members, legislative pacifists who had labored not to be defined by opposition to Trump, leading Congress into an era-defining clash. How the impeachment proceedings affect an increasingly polarized nation is anyone’s guess. But it’s hard to imagine the coming showdown doing any more damage to an institution that, lawmakers in both parties will agree, was broken long before Donald Trump came to town.”



Snap poll shows impeachment supporters outnumber opponents - PBS: “Americans are split over whether they support an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Forty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, while 46 percent of Americans said they disapproved, and 5 percent remained unsure, according to the poll. … Eighty-eight percent of Democrats agreed with the inquiry, along with 44 percent of independent voters, but among Republicans, support was drastically lower, at 6 percent. … This latest poll was conducted the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry…”



Kraushaar: Politics of impeachment now favor Democrats - National Journal: “The politics of impeachment is changing, rapidly. No one knows how this will end, but all signs are pointing to growing trouble for Republicans. The whistleblower’s well-documented allegation that Trump extorted Ukraine, an ally, for political gain is damning and direct. House Democrats are narrowly focused on digging deeper into the explosive evidence as the basis for impeachment. Administration officials connected to the alleged cover-up will be subpoenaed under oath before Congress as part of the impeachment hearings. If the White House thinks things will get better for them, they’re fooling themselves. … The larger reality is that public opinion is more fluid than anyone expected last week. Many anti-Trump pundits, expecting a repeat of our predictable tribal political realities, assumed that nothing has changed. But our politics has become so partisan that even rapid short-term movement suggests something is happening.”



Andrew Cuomo mocks ‘leftist,’ ‘unproductive’ impeachment effort - New York Daily News: “Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized ‘leftist’ Democrats for pushing Congress into launching an impeachment inquiry of President Trump and predicted the probe would lead to government gridlock. The governor derided the ‘quote unquote inquiry’ as the work of angry radicals who forced the hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to mount what he suggested would ultimately be an exercise in futility. ‘There is a heightened leftist component of the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure from,’ Cuomo said. The governor ticked off a list of legislative priorities that would likely languish until after the 2020 elections now that he said Democrats will be focused on removing Trump from power. ‘It’s a long and unproductive road,’ Cuomo said. ‘Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere.’”



TEAM TRUMP LEANS ON MUELLER MOVES

AP: “The White House is dusting off its playbook from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Caught off guard by the speed at which a whistleblower’s claims have morphed into an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and his team are scrambling to respond. They’re turning, at least for now, to some of the same strategies they used to counter special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The basic tactics deployed by the short-staffed White House: Attempt to discredit government officials at the heart of the story. Dispatch Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies to muddy the picture. Lean on Republicans in Congress to provide cover.”



Amy Walter: Impeachment won’t change the game - Cook Political Report: “We are a deeply divided, deeply polarized country. Almost everything we do — from choosing where to eat lunch (Chick-fil-A vs. Whole Foods), to picking where to live (urban/suburban vs. rural/small town) is filtered through the lens of how we identify politically. As such, we shouldn't expect views of impeachment to be any different. Opinions won't swing wildly from day to day or week to week. We also shouldn't expect to see Americans overwhelming support or overwhelmingly oppose impeachment. Like everything in this era, the final verdict on impeachment is likely to be decided on the margins by voters who are holding conflicting views on the president and the process of impeachment. It will be decided by those who may dislike Trump, but are also frustrated by the paralysis in Washington, or those who may like the agenda of the president, but are troubled by his behavior.”



Romney’s narrow road - NYT: “Mr. [Mitt] Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side. It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Mr. Trump’s re-election and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.”



First GOP governors come out in support of impeachment inquiry - WaPo: “For the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.”



THE RULEBOOK: *STANDING OVATION*

TIME OUT: MAN, HOLES

USA Today: “NASA has given us another historic glimpse into the wonders of space after releasing a video that shows a star-shredding black hole in a galaxy millions of light-years away. The amazing footage of the ‘cataclysmic phenomenon’ was taken by NASA’s planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Astronomers think the supermassive black hole weighs around 6 million times the sun’s mass and is located about 375 million light-years away in a galaxy of similar size to the Milky Way, NASA said. The incredible event, called a tidal disruption, is very rare and occurs once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in galaxies like the Milky Way. When a star gets too close, the intense tides of a black hole break apart the star into a stream of gas, according to NASA. As shown in the video, the tail of that stream breaks away from the black hole while other parts of it swing back around and create a halo of debris.”

JOE = JEB? BIDEN BENEFACTORS READY TO MOBILIZE MEGA PAC

NYT: “Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act.”



Under fire, Biden looks to scamper left - WaPo: “Advisers to presidential candidate Joe Biden are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the discussions, as the former vice president now stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a multitrillion-dollar ‘wealth tax’ on the richest Americans. The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each unveiled their own plans to impose a ‘wealth tax’ on multimillionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates. Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.”



Wall Street Democratic donors lay down the law on Warren - CNBC: “Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders.”



A dozen candidates, one night for next Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee intends to hold its fourth presidential primary debate on one night in October, packing the stage with as many as 12 qualified candidates. ‘To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,’ the DNC wrote in an email to campaigns on Friday.”

A LITTLE ON THE NOSE, DON’T YOU THINK?

WABC: “Officials in New Jersey are looking into multiple complaints of a mystery odor that smells like rotten fish. The Hudson Regional Health Commission said they received two complaints in Jersey City and several complaints in Bayonne on Tuesday night. The HRHC confirmed a presence of an odor, but said the source could not be traced. Inspectors went into Newark - specifically to Raymound Boulevard and Doremus Avenue, because winds were coming from that direction. They were not successful in locating the origin. ‘It's not anything were used to around here. Being a peninsula, we have water on three sides and sometimes at low tide that you can smell the bay. It was really nothing like that. It was a very nasty, almost like a foul meat type of smell,’ OEM Coordinator Edoardo Ferrante said. The New Jersey DEP has been investigating the same odor since the beginning of summer.”

“Law & Order: SVU” star Ice-T, who plays the fan-favorite Fin Tutula on the legendary ""ripped from the headlines"" crime drama, said that this season, fans will see an allusion to the saga of former “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett that played out in the news earlier this year.

ICE-T CALLS OUT AMAZON AFTER HE 'ALMOST SHOT' ONE OF THE COMPANY'S DELIVERY DRIVERS

“I mean, I don’t know what I can say,” the 61-year-old actor told Us Weekly on Wednesday at “History Is Made: Law & Order: SVU Celebrates a Milestone” at the Paley Center for Media. “I can give you some hints.”

The rapper said an “Empire-ish drama” would somehow seep into a Season 21 episode, but not before the gang adjusts to new roles within the district attorney’s office.

Smollett made national and world headlines in January when he filed a police report alleging that two masked men attacked him, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him. Smollett, who is black and openly gay, claimed the men made racist and homophobic comments and yelled, “This is MAGA country,"" a pointed reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

After an intense investigation, police said Smollett had staged the entire episode to drum up publicity for his career. Smollett, who was dropped from ""Empire,"" has strongly denied the accusations.

ICE-T SAYS HE'S NEVER EATEN A BAGEL IN HIS LIFE

Showrunners said the entire cast will be making major adjustments following the season premiere.

“Welcome to the DA’s office, District Attorney Sonny Carisi,” showrunner Warren Leight told the magazine on Wednesday. “We’ll be looking out for some new blood in the squadron over time, and I think a lot of changes in the dynamic. It’s one thing when you work for lieutenant, now Captain Benson at the end of this episode. It’s another thing when you now go to the DA’s office and technically you are in charge of her in some ways.”

ICE-T ARRESTED FOR DRIVING THROUGH A TOLL WITHOUT PAYING

Of course, it's hardly the first time an “SVU” episode has drawn parallels to real-world events. In November 2016, NBC chose to pull a Donald Trump-inspired episode from its scheduled airing, which was slated to run eight days after the presidential election.

Hernadez’s emotions got the better of him as he got back to the dugout.

IN CROWDED DEMOCRATIC 2020 FIELD, CANDIDATES ARE MEETING WITH GROUPS WHO HOLD CLOUT

“My roommate didn’t know that I was anything besides an active-duty lieutenant,"" the candidate recalled as his bus made its way to Boone, Iowa during a four-day tour of central and eastern Iowa.

But once his fellow service members found out, he said, ""they would start calling me the honorable lieutenant.""

Five years ago, Buttigieg was among the rank and file of the United States military. Now he’s on a bus in Iowa trying to win over voters and distinguish himself in a crowded field of Democrats running for president.

“I think of a lot of them think it’s funny that someone they know is running for president,” Buttigieg said of those he served with in Afghanistan. “They’ve been encouraging.""

He added: ""I mean a lot of them are more politically conservative than I am, but they are supportive.”

Buttigieg decided to take a page from former Republican presidential candidate John McCain’s playbook by emulating the Arizona senator's famous “Straight Talk Express” bus tours -- in which he traveled with members of the media and opened himself up to questions on any topic.

It was Buttigieg’s first cup of coffee Sunday morning when he began comparing politics to football.

“I think football provides the most analogies for politics, he said. ""You’re protecting the quarterback but it’s not all about the quarterback -- because if you forget the importance of the line ,you’re in trouble.""

The campaign and reporters traveled to nine cities in four days on the Premiere Transportation coach that former President Barack Obama, legendary director Steven Spielberg, Sen. Mitt Romney, and entertainers Steve Harvey and Justin Timberlake have used. President Trump also rode on the bus at one point, according to Premiere Transportation staff.

It wasn’t typical bus seating.

The furniture allowed Buttigieg to look reporters in the eye. The bus was equipped with Wi-Fi for the press to file stories, and a flat-screen television, which allowed Buttigieg to keep an eye on football and the news. Also installed: a counter full of snacks, including chocolate chip cookies, protein bars, chips, gummy bears and coffee.

“I like sliced pickles, but other than that, my snack choices are pretty basic. I like beef jerky,” he said.

When he wasn't talking to reporters, Buttigieg was trying to make contact with Iowa voters.

“I looked at all the presidential [candidates] and I put a chart out,"" Amani Latimer, a Wisconsin voter and founder of Mamas 4 Pete, said after Buttigieg’s meet-and-greet in Dubuque. “I was, like, all over analytics, and I said this guy gets it.”

“I think he would make a great president, I mean he so’s smart,” Iowa caucusgoer Lindra Bicksler said after a campaign rally in Clinton. “He speaks seven languages and would be able to talk to leaders of other countries himself.”

While the yellow and blue bus rolled through rural Iowa, Buttigieg took a moment from talking with reporters to pull out his phone and look at the latest polls from The Des Moines Register and CNN. They put him fourth behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Oh, it’s a four-way race,” Buttigieg said.

Buttigieg said the bus tour is just one part of his strategy of connecting with voters in smaller communities, who he says are key to the Dem nomination.

“I’m not too worried about a variation like that, especially in a moment when only one in five people say they’ve made up their mind,” he said. “I think the important thing is that people know you, know what you’re about, do they like what they see -- and we’re seeing a lot of encouragement on that front.”

As voters prepare for the first-in-the-nation caucus and the first primary in New Hampshire, Buttigieg said his campaign has plans to step up outreach to voters. The bus may next head for the Granite State."

Dangerous leaks like this must end,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/douglas-mackinnon-ukraine-scandal-whistleblowers-reported-cia-post-raises-troubling-questions,"Several news organizations have reported that the whistleblower behind the “Ukraine impeachment” feeding frenzy is a CIA officer who was detailed to the White House.

If accurate, that raises some very troubling questions and scenarios.

Not for President Trump. But rather, for the CIA and others in the Deep State who may be leaking confidential and top secret information for personal or partisan reasons.

HOUSE COMMITTEES SUBPOENA POMPEO FOR UKRAINE DOCUMENTS AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The Trump White House and CIA have a history. Part of it has been adversarial from the very beginning of the Trump administration.

Over two years ago, new organizations reported that career officials within the CIA were doing everything in their power to remove Ezra Cohen-Watnick, Trump’s then-senior director for intelligence on the National Security Council.

The CIA officials were reportedly outraged that Cohen-Watnick, along with his previous boss, Michael Flynn, saw eye-to-eye about what they believed to be the failings of CIA human intelligence operations.

In a news report at the time, an intelligence community insider said CIA officials viewed Cohen-Watnick as a ""threat,"" so they tried to replace him with an ""agency loyalist.""

An agency loyalist. One can and should read a lot into that particular description.

In theory and by law, all intelligence operatives should be loyal to the United States of America, and not an agency, ideology, political party or even a past president.

But that is where human nature steps into the equation. Human nature dictates that we all have biases.

As we have seen during the course of these politically polarized three years, some people are overly influenced or even blinded by liberal bias. Others by conservative bias.

Human nature and bias do not cease to exist once one enters the intelligence community. But it must be seen for what it is and then controlled.

It can certainly be argued that before the election of Donald Trump, President Obama spent eight years stacking the intelligence community deck with political and professional operatives who strongly agreed with his ideological view of the world.

It can also be argued that many of those Obama holdovers were horrified by the election of Trump, and suddenly saw it as their “duty” to do anything in their power to delegitimize him and his administration.

There is no doubt that since Day One of the Trump presidency, the “duty” of some of these intelligence operatives was to open a direct pipeline to certain members of the media to leak classified or secret information with the sole intention of harming the president personally and professionally.

As I have stressed in the past, I don’t believe there is any government agency more critical to the welfare of our national security than the Central Intelligence Agency. Its field operatives anonymously put their lives on the line every single day to protect us all. With Gina Haspel as director, the agency could not be in more capable hands.

'The Contract' was a plank of popular proposals that the Republicans pledged to pursue if the voters put them in power. Plus, it came with a caveat -- if the new Republican majority didn't follow through, then the voters should kick them out of office.

NEWT GINGRICH: SPEAKER PELOSI: THIS IS THE INVESTIGATION CONGRESS NEEDS TO DO RIGHT NOW

""The Contract gave people something worth voting for. We pledged that if you voted Republican in the 1994 election we would bring 10 points of supporting legislation to the House floor. If these legislative policies appeal to you the only way to get them is to vote Republican,"" said Gingrich in Fox Nation's new series ""Inside the Contract With America.""

A few weeks after Gingrich's gamble, Republicans won enough seats in the 1994 midterm elections to secure a majority in the House of Representatives -- overturning 40 years of Democratic-control.

'The Contract' was a revolutionary idea and it is credited with contributing to one of the most dramatic political events in American history -- the Republican Revolution. It included some proposals that were realized such as welfare reform -- and to an extent -- term limits, and others than were not such as the balanced budget.

EXPERTS SAYS CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT WAS POLITICAL BLUNDER FOR REPUBLICANS

Liberal criticism of 'The Contract' started almost immediately.

""The Democrats played into it, they attacked it. They helped us make it a news story,"" former Republican National Committee chairman and 2017 Virginia gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie told Fox Nation.

In fact, shortly after the 1994 midterm election, Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., went on CSPAN to offer a progressive response.

""The Contract is a fraud. We think that the more the American people understand what is in the contract, which essentially amounts to very large tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country, the eventual destruction of social security, major slashes in Medicare and Medicaid, increasing military spending and cutting back on nutrition programs for hungry children and for needy senior citizens, I think as people understand what is in the contract I think they will begin to reject it,"" said Sen. Sanders.

Gingrich came up with the idea of reaching around the media to communicate directly with the American electorate and that plan included putting an advertisement in the TV Guide.

""We're in Annapolis, I think in the Spring of '94. [Former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour] and I go to an old bar that's in a Federalist era building right across from the state capital. Down in the basement. And we're sitting there talking,"" remembered Gingrich in the Fox Nation show.

Barbour recalled that he walked into this meeting without being clear on what it was all about.

""Newt's big idea was we're gonna put an ad in TV Guide. The idea was we're gonna put an insert in there about 'Contract with America'. And the message is, if you elect Republicans to run the House of Representatives if we win the House of Representative this is what we pledge we'll do,"" Barbour said.

The advertisment was printed on a page of the TV Guide that was designed to be torn out and used as a checklist to hold their elected representatives accountable.

""Here's our 10 things, tear this out of your TV Guide, post it up on your refrigerator, and as we do 'em check 'em off, done, done, done. And within a hundred days, if you don't have 10 check marks we don't deserve to be reelected,"" said Barry Johnson, former Executive Director of 'Contract with America.'

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Fox News contributor Liz Peek said that lawmakers should learn from the history of the 'Republican Revolution.'

""The American people are commonsensical... I actually think that in our political world today we underestimate the value of promising good governence and those aren't policies -- that's values,"" she said.

FOX NEWS HOSTS ON DEMS' IMPEACHMENT PUSH

Wall Street Journal Editorial Page member Bill McGurn agreed, ""They picked issues -- unlike Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren picking some of these issues that have no support -- they looked and said 'Where are the American people aligned most strongly with Republican principals.'""

Reflecting back on the selling of the 'Contract with America', Johnson told Fox Nation that it was a smashing success, ""[I]t got to the point where one of the industry magazines, 'Advertising Age' puts out an annual issue naming their top marketing campaigns of the year. 'The Contract with America' was the top marketing campaign of the year, and the front cover of Advertising Age had this picture of Newt and I standing on the Speaker's balcony and they did an interview with us and everything. That's just one of those little weird things that happened out of 'The Contract.'""

Researchers from security firm Cisco Talos reported this week that the website, Hire Military Heroes, was distributing malware that allows hackers to gain control of the victim’s computer, as reported by Bleeping Computer.

An interesting twist is that the hackers may also be targeting active servicemen and not just veterans, according to ZDNet, which cites that Iran may be behind the attack.

BEWARE OF CREEPY 'SIM SWAP' FRAUD THAT LETS HACKERS TAKE OVER YOUR PHONE AND STEAL YOUR MONEY

A cybersecurity analyst from the Department of Homeland Security, speaking on background, told ZDNet that the attackers are aiming at military networks.

""They [the hackers] are hoping that one of their targets would use a DOD system to download and run the malware,"" the analyst told the news outlet. ""Chances are low, but it's worth a shot…Pretty clever approach, if I can say so,” the analyst added, referring to the Department of Defense.

Fox News has reached out to Cisco regarding Iran's reported involvement with the hack.

The bad actor had been previously identified by Symantec as Tortoiseshell, a group behind a previous attack on an IT provider in Saudi Arabia, according to Cisco Talos.

The fake veterans website has three links to download a desktop app for free — but the app is actually a fake installer. When the fake installer starts, the progress bar almost fills up entirely and then displays an error message.

“The installer checks if Google is reachable. If not, the installation stops. If it is reachable, the installer downloads two binaries [files],” according to Cisco Talos.

CHINESE CYBER HACKERS HAVE BUILT A BACKDOOR IN US-CHINA TRADE WAR, REPORT SAYS

One of the binary files is used to perform “reconnaissance” on the system and the second is the Remote Administrative Tool.

“The attacker retrieves information such as the date, time and drivers,"" Cisco Talos researchers wrote in the report. ""The attacker can then see information on the system, the patch level, the number of processors, the network configuration, the hardware, firmware versions, the domain controller, the name of the admin, the list of the account, etc. This is a significant amount of information relating to a machine and makes the attacker well-prepared to carry out additional attacks.”

Both the amount and the kind of information that is targeted makes the attacks particularly dangerous, Warren Mercer, a researcher at Cisco Talos, told Fox News.

“When you focus on the agenda of the attackers, it’s unlikely to be a garden variety attack…they certainly wanted something much more meaningful than your cat pictures,” Mercer said.

Mercer added that it’s difficult to assess the effectiveness of this attack since it was discovered before the operation went into high gear. “We did not identify any ‘in-the-wild’ activity associated and since our publication, the threat actor’s website is now unavailable.”

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., were sexist if they kept supporting him over Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

""I actually overheard someone saying -- that I thought was an interesting point -- that basically at this point if you are still supporting Sanders as opposed to Warren, it's kind of showing your sexism because she has more detailed plans and her plans have evolved,"" strategist Emily Tisch Sussman said on Monday.

""I thought it was an interesting point and I think there might be something to it,"" she added while speaking on ""MSNBC Live.""

Her comments came as new polls showed Warren beating both Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the Democratic primary calendar. Sanders and Warren have been portrayed as the standard-bearers for the Democrats' far-left wing.

Sussman indicated that Sanders' candidacy was a lost cause, telling MSNBC host Craig Melvin that Warren was taking voters from Sanders and that the Vermont senator had ""peaked"" in the race.

""What we're seeing of his supporters -- there's a ceiling. There is nowhere to go -- there is no up to go,"" she added.

Nina Turner, who co-chairs Sanders' campaign, called Sussman's comments ""foolishness."" ""I’m truly trying to wrap my mind around this foolishness,"" she tweeted early Saturday, alongside an annoyed emoji.

Other women responded on Twitter Saturday, citing Sanders' support for various economic policies -- many of which Warren herself has backed.

NYPD USES TECH TO GAUGE CITIZENS' SENSE OF SAFETY: IT'S A 'SHARED RESPONSIBILITY'

After a shootout and standoff in Philadelphia, several people near the scene in the Nicetown neighborhood taunted and laughed at the officers whose fellow officers had just been wounded.

NYPD officers have been doused with water, soaked with milk, pelted with Chinese takeout, cursed at and assaulted in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Harlem. NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill vowed recently that “These incidents of disrespect, we cannot tolerate them. There has to be consequences for them, and it has to stop.”

While hundreds of thousands protested climate change around the world and in Portland, Oregon, a faction of masked Antifa militants dressed in black harassed police officers.

As U.S. Attorney William McSwain of Pennsylvania’s Eastern District pointed out in a recent statement, we have a “new culture of disrespect for law enforcement.”

This breaks my heart. When a police officer or sheriff’s deputy approaches a car at night or knocks on a door for a welfare check or to serve a warrant, that officer or deputy hopes for the best and fears the worst. Their family is often left holding their breath until they return home after their shift is over.

And yet, it’s disturbing that three of the Democratic Party’s presidential candidates (Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Tom Steyer) still say that Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson committed murder in shooting criminal suspect Michael Brown. Their position is completely at odds with the findings of the Department of Justice’s investigation of that incident.

Obama’s Justice Department, led by then-Attorney General Eric Holder, issued its own report, ruling it self-defense. This was despite that department’s repeated friction with local and state law enforcement throughout Obama’s presidency.

On the other side is President Trump, who has been an unwavering supporter of law enforcement. The motto of the Fraternal Order of Police is ""Jus, fidus, libertatum."" Translated, it means, ""Law is the safeguard of freedom."" President Trump has been steadfast in backing the blue and the Department of Justice under his leadership continues to fulfill his commitment to law enforcement.

No matter what your political persuasion, we should all agree that public safety is a high priority for all Americans. Every American child should be able to play in their front yard, free from the fear of neighborhood violence.

If accurate, that raises some very troubling questions and scenarios.

Not for President Trump. But rather, for the CIA and others in the Deep State who may be leaking confidential and top secret information for personal or partisan reasons.

HOUSE COMMITTEES SUBPOENA POMPEO FOR UKRAINE DOCUMENTS AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The Trump White House and CIA have a history. Part of it has been adversarial from the very beginning of the Trump administration.

Over two years ago, new organizations reported that career officials within the CIA were doing everything in their power to remove Ezra Cohen-Watnick, Trump’s then-senior director for intelligence on the National Security Council.

The CIA officials were reportedly outraged that Cohen-Watnick, along with his previous boss, Michael Flynn, saw eye-to-eye about what they believed to be the failings of CIA human intelligence operations.

In a news report at the time, an intelligence community insider said CIA officials viewed Cohen-Watnick as a ""threat,"" so they tried to replace him with an ""agency loyalist.""

An agency loyalist. One can and should read a lot into that particular description.

In theory and by law, all intelligence operatives should be loyal to the United States of America, and not an agency, ideology, political party or even a past president.

But that is where human nature steps into the equation. Human nature dictates that we all have biases.

As we have seen during the course of these politically polarized three years, some people are overly influenced or even blinded by liberal bias. Others by conservative bias.

Human nature and bias do not cease to exist once one enters the intelligence community. But it must be seen for what it is and then controlled.

It can certainly be argued that before the election of Donald Trump, President Obama spent eight years stacking the intelligence community deck with political and professional operatives who strongly agreed with his ideological view of the world.

It can also be argued that many of those Obama holdovers were horrified by the election of Trump, and suddenly saw it as their “duty” to do anything in their power to delegitimize him and his administration.

There is no doubt that since Day One of the Trump presidency, the “duty” of some of these intelligence operatives was to open a direct pipeline to certain members of the media to leak classified or secret information with the sole intention of harming the president personally and professionally.

The crypto whiz kid who paid $4.6 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett, only to postpone at the last minute, will endorse Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie's shoes this season.

Tron and BitTorrent CEO Justin Sun will pay 8.2 bitcoins — worth about $66,000 at the time of writing — that the basketball player has pledged to donate to his charity. Dinwiddie wears a fresh set of custom sneakers each game — past pairs have honored Stan Lee, Colin Kaepernick, and Barack Obama — then auctions them and gives a portion of the proceeds to the Dinwiddie Family Foundation, according to the LA Times.

""This year Id like to announce an endorsement with @Tronfoundation and @justinsuntron. 8.2btc (.1btc/game) for my 2019/2020 game worn shoes. And in the essence of transparency I pledge that same 8.2btc to charity! This will allow us to continue to expand our mission to help youth!"" Dinwiddie tweeted.

Twitter/Spencer Dinwiddie

Dinwiddie has previously invested in Tron's cryptocurrency, according to Bleacher Report. He was planning to launch a digital token giving investors a piece of his $34.4 million contract, but the National Basketball Association has smacked the idea down, according to the New York Times.

After the NBA rejected his idea, Dinwiddie confirmed his deal with Sun was still on. ""Also, in case you were worried I'm still going to give the 8.2btc to charity from my shoes lol,"" he tweeted.

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang expressed disappointment at the NBA's decision. ""I think @SDinwiddie_25 selling interests in his professional earnings is genius and am disappointed the NBA is disallowing it,"" he tweeted.

The pair have exchanged friendly tweets in the past, with Dinwiddie saying ""you may have gained a vote"" after Yang tweeted about the Brooklyn Nets, leading them to make plans to meet at a game this fall.

Sun has also expressed support for Yang's policies. After the candidate pledged to give $1,000 a month to 10 American families over the next year, Sun tweeted he would give the same amount to 100 families — a total of $1.2 million —next year. On a livestream last week, Sun said he would message Yang about a potential partnership.

Dinwiddie isn't Sun's first basketball connection. Kobe Bryant, the former Los Angeles Lakers star, was the guest speaker at Tron's Nitron Summit in January.

Sun, a protégé of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, invited high-profile crypto personalities including Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Huobi CEO Livio Weng — as well as President Donald Trump — to his charity lunch with Buffett. However, he postponed the meal three days before it was scheduled, blaming a bout of kidney stones.

Sun apologized on Chinese social media for overhyping himself, and Tron employees were briefly detained by officials in China, according to Bloomberg, fueling conspiracies he was in trouble with the Chinese government. He expects to reschedule the Buffett lunch ""very soon,"" he said on the livestream."

The crypto whiz kid who paid $4.6 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett, only to postpone at the last minute, will endorse Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie's shoes this season.

Tron and BitTorrent CEO Justin Sun will pay 8.2 bitcoins — worth about $66,000 at the time of writing — that the basketball player has pledged to donate to his charity. Dinwiddie wears a fresh set of custom sneakers each game — past pairs have honored Stan Lee, Colin Kaepernick, and Barack Obama — then auctions them and gives a portion of the proceeds to the Dinwiddie Family Foundation, according to the LA Times.

""This year Id like to announce an endorsement with @Tronfoundation and @justinsuntron. 8.2btc (.1btc/game) for my 2019/2020 game worn shoes. And in the essence of transparency I pledge that same 8.2btc to charity! This will allow us to continue to expand our mission to help youth!"" Dinwiddie tweeted.

Twitter/Spencer Dinwiddie

Dinwiddie has previously invested in Tron's cryptocurrency, according to Bleacher Report. He was planning to launch a digital token giving investors a piece of his $34.4 million contract, but the National Basketball Association has smacked the idea down, according to the New York Times.

After the NBA rejected his idea, Dinwiddie confirmed his deal with Sun was still on. ""Also, in case you were worried I'm still going to give the 8.2btc to charity from my shoes lol,"" he tweeted.

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang expressed disappointment at the NBA's decision. ""I think @SDinwiddie_25 selling interests in his professional earnings is genius and am disappointed the NBA is disallowing it,"" he tweeted.

The pair have exchanged friendly tweets in the past, with Dinwiddie saying ""you may have gained a vote"" after Yang tweeted about the Brooklyn Nets, leading them to make plans to meet at a game this fall.

Sun has also expressed support for Yang's policies. After the candidate pledged to give $1,000 a month to 10 American families over the next year, Sun tweeted he would give the same amount to 100 families — a total of $1.2 million —next year. On a livestream last week, Sun said he would message Yang about a potential partnership.

Dinwiddie isn't Sun's first basketball connection. Kobe Bryant, the former Los Angeles Lakers star, was the guest speaker at Tron's Nitron Summit in January.

Sun, a protégé of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, invited high-profile crypto personalities including Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Huobi CEO Livio Weng — as well as President Donald Trump — to his charity lunch with Buffett. However, he postponed the meal three days before it was scheduled, blaming a bout of kidney stones.

Sun apologized on Chinese social media for overhyping himself, and Tron employees were briefly detained by officials in China, according to Bloomberg, fueling conspiracies he was in trouble with the Chinese government. He expects to reschedule the Buffett lunch ""very soon,"" he said on the livestream."

One option that was reported: removing Chinese companies from American stock exchanges.

Such steps would open a new front in a more than yearlong trade dispute between the largest economies.

The Trump administration has pushed back against reports that officials are looking into ways to curb US investment in China, a development that would open a new front in a more than yearlong trade dispute between the largest economies.

Bloomberg News reported last week that administration officials had held internal discussions about the potential to remove Chinese companies from American stock exchanges, as well as several other actions that would restrict American portfolio flows into China. Several other news outlets including the New York Times confirmed the report.

The White House declined to comment on Monday. Bloomberg News could not immediately be reached.

""That story, which appeared in Bloomberg: I've read it far more carefully than it was written,"" White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday. ""Over half of it was highly inaccurate or simply flat-out false.""

Navarro did not specify which parts of the report he disputed. Treasury spokesperson Monica Crowley said over the weekend the administration was not ""contemplating blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges at this time.""

China warned the Trump administration against such actions Monday, days before officials were set to meet for high-level trade negotiations in Washington. The two sides have seen tensions escalate dramatically in recent weeks, with further tariff hikes scheduled to take place in October and December.

""To exert extreme pressure and even attempt to force the decoupling of China-US relations will definitely damage the interests of US and Chinese enterprises and people, cause financial market turmoil and endanger international trade and the world economic growth,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said.

Hopes for a deal to defuse tensions dimmed this summer, even as businesses and consumers warned of damage to both economies. President Donald Trump has long vacillated between apparent optimism toward China and threats that the dispute could last into 2020 and beyond.

Democrats did something even stupider.

By jumping so eagerly on the impeachment bandwagon, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues have taken Biden, Democrats' most credible candidate, out of contention. The former vice president’s campaign was already on the downslope, but widespread speculation about his possible abuse of office will only accelerate his demise.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: TRUMP COULD FACE DEATH PENALTY FOR TREASON, HOPELESS CHALLENGER BILL WELD FOOLISHLY CLAIMS

Almost certainly, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will become the new frontrunner, and will win the Democratic nomination. And, almost certainly, she will lose.

There is no disputing that Hunter Biden accepted a lucrative job in Ukraine at a time when his father, who was vice president at the time, became the point person for the U.S. in that notoriously corrupt country. That he allowed his son to do so demonstrates extreme bad judgement on the part of Joe Biden. That he pushed the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor reputed to be investigating his son’s employer smells bad.

Most Americans will not read beyond the headlines. What they have learned, courtesy of the newest attacks on President Trump, is that good old Joe Biden, the likeable and loyal Obama sidekick who somehow has not secured the former president’s endorsement, cannot be trusted.

Voters will experience a whiff of déjà vu, remembering that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s clan also profited mightily from her position in the Obama administration. They may recall that, according to The New York Times, ""While the State Department was involved in securing a uranium mining deal with Russia, investors in the company involved in the deal, Uranium One, gave millions to the Clinton Foundation.""

The NYT report added, ""Shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.""

Voters rejected Clinton for many reasons in 2016, but one of the most enduring throughout her run was that people didn’t trust her. On the cusp of the Democratic nomination, a CNN poll found that 68 percent of the country didn’t think she was ""honest and trustworthy."" Despite being awarded innumerable ""Pinocchios"" on the campaign trail, Trump’s score on that front was much better than Hillary's.

Joe Biden is not Hillary, of course. He is more popular, but as he has campaigned, his star has fallen. In two recent polls, according to RealClearPolitics, Warren has grabbed the lead nationally, and in Iowa, Biden’s position has fallen precipitously; he is now clearly in second place. Moreover, a recent Quinnipiac poll shows, Biden's personal favorability rating among registered voters split 45-45 percent, down from last December, when his favorability was 53-33.

Assuming that Warren’s surge continues, and that she becomes the Democratic Party’s nominee, most analysts reckon she will have to pivot to the political middle to win the voters lost to Democrats in 2016. That includes blue-collar workers in crucial states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, who defected to Trump.

Almost certainly, Elizabeth Warren will become the new frontrunner, and will win the Democratic nomination. And, almost certainly, she will lose.

So when Warren promises to ban fracking, voters in gas-rich Pennsylvania, where the Marcellus shale boom has added tens of thousands of jobs, will wonder, is this good for me? When she advocates ""Medicare-for-all,"" United Automobile Workers in Michigan will ask, why do I have to give up my hard-won Cadillac health benefits? When she argues for decriminalizing illegal immigration and vows to give federal benefits to people in the country illegally, Americans will complain — what about us?

Warren is determined to eliminate the Electoral College, so that New York and California will run the country. She wants to break up big farms and also big tech, undermining two of our most productive and competitive industries, legalize marijuana, ban assault weapons and won't say if she is opposed to abortions in the third trimester.

She also wants to punish our most successful entrepreneurs and inventors by confiscating their wealth, which will drive many out of the country. Though she’s eager to take more money out of the hands of our private citizens in order to build up the powerful state, she is determined to slash defense spending.

There are many people who will agree with some of these policies, but the majority of Americans will stumble on issues like open borders or third-trimester abortions. And, as she is asked how we will pay for all her grandiose plans, it will occur to some that their taxes will go up.

Indeed, when pressed by Stephen Colbert on whether she’ll hike middle-class taxes, she danced around the question. It will come up again.

More important, it will become obvious as she campaigns on higher taxes and increased regulations, that Warren will undo the good that has occurred under President Trump. People who have seen the income gap between rich and poor narrow and job opportunities multiply for all workers, will decide they are better off today that they were four years ago, and decide there is risk in turning our entire economy upside down. They will be right.

Meanwhile, Trump supporters will not be moved by the most recent charges. They have become inured to the constant attacks; consequently, the Republican-led Senate will not throw him out of office. Not even close.

Warren will try, but ultimately fail, to shift ground. She is an uncompromising zealot, who totally believes her rants about corporations being corrupt and greedy, and about everything in the United States being rigged. That’s why she claimed to have Native American ancestry; she knew that the lie would help her get a job in this rigged system.

Bernie Sanders gets his way, companies with top executives who earn at least 50 times what their average workers do will see significant tax increases.

“The American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the health care and pension benefits of their employees,” the progressive senator from Vermont stressed Monday as he introduced his Inequality Tax Plan.

SANDERS UPS THE ANTE, PROPOSING BIGGER WEALTH TAX THAN WARREN'S PLAN

Sanders, who’s running a second campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, has made erasing income and wealth inequality central components of his White House bid. His new plan would raise taxes on companies with what he calls “exorbitant” pay gaps between their executives and workers.”

“It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you,” he said emphatically.

If Sanders is elected and his plan enacted, tax penalties will begin at 0.5 percent for companies paying their top executives from 50 to 100 times more than their typical workers. The penalties scale up all the way to 5 percent for companies paying their top executives more than 500 times what their average workers earn.

“Some corporations where workers are making terrible wages, the CEO is making 500 or a thousand times more than their employee,” Sanders said Monday at a campaign event in New Hampshire. “Over the last 30 years, the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth, while the bottom half of America has seen a decline in their wealth.”

The Sanders campaign said that if the senator’s campaign was in effect last year, banking giant J.P. Morgan Chase would have paid up to $991.6 million more in taxes, and Walmart $793.8 million more.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Sanders released his new tax proposal a week after he unveiled a plan to tax the wealthiest Americans to diminish income inequality and to begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing.

“There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders wrote on Twitter last week. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist.""

The senator’s plan followed a similar proposal earlier this year from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The Sanders and Warren plans to boost taxes on the ultrawealthy were criticized last week by 2020 Democratic rival Andrew Yang.

The tech entrepreneur, who’s seen his campaign surge in recent months said on Twitter: “I understand the spirit and appeal of a wealth tax. It makes sense that those who enjoy vast fortunes should pay back into the system, particularly given the concentrations of wealth in our winner-take-all economy.""

But, he added, ""implementation would be impractical and problematic.”

Sanders' return to New Hampshire came days after the most recent poll in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state – from Monmouth University -- indicated the senator fading to a distant third behind longtime frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden and Warren.

Sanders downplayed that poll during an interview Monday with NHTalkRadio.com. “We’re feeling great,” he said. The turnouts are great… I think we have a great organization here in New Hampshire.”

And he repeated he was confident that he would once again win the state that four years ago made him a household name across the country when he crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire presidential primary.

Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday announced a new income-inequality plan that would tax companies that pay CEOs more than 50 times the pay of the median worker.

Sanders' campaign said the plan would raise $150 billion in a decade, which would be used to pay for his plan to eliminate existing medical debt.

Companies like McDonald's, JPMorgan, and Walmart would have paid hundreds of millions more in taxes if the plan had been in effect last year, the Sanders campaign said.

On Monday, the Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders announced a new tax plan aimed at bridging the pay gap between the highest-paid top executives and their employees.

Sanders' Income Inequality Tax Plan would tax ""companies with exorbitant pay gaps between their executives and typical workers.""

""The American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the healthcare and pension benefits of their employees,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""They want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.""

The plan comes on the heels of Sanders' separate wealth-tax plan to tax the nation's ultrarich.

CEO pay has become a hot topic, especially as it has been increasingly called out by economists, politicians, and even activists such as Abigail Disney, who described the former Disney CEO Bob Iger's pay as a ""moral issue"" when she testified before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year.

Sanders' campaign said the inequality tax would raise an estimated $150 billion over the next decade. The revenue generated from the tax would be used to pay for Sanders' plan to eliminate existing medical debt.

The inequality-tax plan would increase the tax rate of companies where the CEO makes at least 50 times what the median worker does. If the CEO is not the highest-paid executive at the firm, the 50-1 ratio will be calculated using the highest-paid employee.

The plan would increase the tax rate by 0.5 percentage points for companies whose ratio falls between 50-to-1 and 100-to-1, up to a 5-point increase for companies whose pay ratio is more than 500-to-1. The tax would apply to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million, the campaign said.

Here's how much more companies would have paid in taxes if the tax plan had been in effect last year, according to the Sanders campaign:

McDonald's would have paid up to $110.9 million more.

Walmart would have paid up to $793.8 million more.

JPMorgan Chase would have paid up to $991.6 million more.

Home Depot would have paid up to $538.2 million more.

American Airlines would have paid up to $18.8 million more.

""At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,"" Sanders said. ""It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.""

Companies would not owe any additional taxes under the plan if they increased annual median worker pay to $60,000 and curbed CEO compensation to $3 million, the Sanders campaign said."

When I served as a prosecutor in Des Moines, Iowa and ultimately served as the acting attorney general of the United States, I viewed firsthand the professionalism and dedication of police officers and sheriffs’ deputies across the country. I repeatedly shared with them how the U.S. Department of Justice has their back and they have the thanks of a grateful nation.

Unfortunately, we have recently seen too many examples of a complete lack of disrespect for the men and women in blue.

NYPD USES TECH TO GAUGE CITIZENS' SENSE OF SAFETY: IT'S A 'SHARED RESPONSIBILITY'

After a shootout and standoff in Philadelphia, several people near the scene in the Nicetown neighborhood taunted and laughed at the officers whose fellow officers had just been wounded.

NYPD officers have been doused with water, soaked with milk, pelted with Chinese takeout, cursed at and assaulted in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Harlem. NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill vowed recently that “These incidents of disrespect, we cannot tolerate them. There has to be consequences for them, and it has to stop.”

While hundreds of thousands protested climate change around the world and in Portland, Oregon, a faction of masked Antifa militants dressed in black harassed police officers.

As U.S. Attorney William McSwain of Pennsylvania’s Eastern District pointed out in a recent statement, we have a “new culture of disrespect for law enforcement.”

This breaks my heart. When a police officer or sheriff’s deputy approaches a car at night or knocks on a door for a welfare check or to serve a warrant, that officer or deputy hopes for the best and fears the worst. Their family is often left holding their breath until they return home after their shift is over.

And yet, it’s disturbing that three of the Democratic Party’s presidential candidates (Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Tom Steyer) still say that Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson committed murder in shooting criminal suspect Michael Brown. Their position is completely at odds with the findings of the Department of Justice’s investigation of that incident.

Obama’s Justice Department, led by then-Attorney General Eric Holder, issued its own report, ruling it self-defense. This was despite that department’s repeated friction with local and state law enforcement throughout Obama’s presidency.

On the other side is President Trump, who has been an unwavering supporter of law enforcement. The motto of the Fraternal Order of Police is ""Jus, fidus, libertatum."" Translated, it means, ""Law is the safeguard of freedom."" President Trump has been steadfast in backing the blue and the Department of Justice under his leadership continues to fulfill his commitment to law enforcement.

No matter what your political persuasion, we should all agree that public safety is a high priority for all Americans. Every American child should be able to play in their front yard, free from the fear of neighborhood violence.

Cory Booker says he has reached his self-imposed fundraising goal to continue his White House bid.

“I have some incredible news, friend. Last night at 8:16 p.m., we reached our goal of $1.7 million -- a full day ahead of the deadline we set for ourselves,” the Democrat from New Jersey wrote in an email to supporters on Monday morning.

“Thanks to this outpouring of support, we see a viable path forward to continue growing a winning campaign. I’m staying in this race -- and I’m in it to win,” Booker said.

Nine days ago the senator from New Jersey announced that if he didn’t haul in $1.7 million by the end of the month – which marks the end of the July-September third quarter of fundraising – he would likely end his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

2020 DEMOCRATIC FIELD POISED FOR NEW PURGE, WITH CRUCIAL DEADLINES LOOMING

Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Top Booker advisers have warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand and compete with the top-tier Democratic nomination rivals.

Booker raised $4.5 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising, far behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

“We got to a point where we saw candidates that were raising multiples of what we were raising,” Booker told reporters on Thursday during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. “We were not going to be able to stay in competition with them unless we raise significant money, so I told the truth.”

With that in mind, Booker told his supporters on Monday that “this won’t be the last mountain we have to climb on our way to the nomination -- we have a lot more money to raise to continue being competitive with the better-funded campaigns in this race. I’ll be asking more of my supporters as we move forward in this campaign together.”

And he didn’t waste any time, setting another goal of raising an additional $217,000 by the end of Monday to put him over the $2 million mark since announcing his original pitch nine days ago.

Booker announced on Twitter late in the the afternoon on Monday that he reached the $2 million mark.

The Booker campaign has pushed back against descriptions of the fundraising goal as a kind of gimmick. But the candidate himself acknowledged one of his intentions was to pump up fundraising.

Asked last week by a reporter from New Hampshire Public Radio “if this is just a gambit to raise money or are you really on the cusp of not having enough money,” Booker answered “both.”

While Booker qualified for the third and fourth round Democratic presidential primary debates, he has struggled in polling, averaging in the low to mid-single digits, far behind the top-tier contenders.

The Booker campaign highlighted on Sunday that they’ve reached the higher donor threshold to qualify for November’s fifth-round debate. To make the stage, candidates receive contributions from at least 165,000 individual donors – including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

But Booker remains short of reaching the polling criteria."

""I think she was one of the greatest Americans in our history,"" Hillary Clinton said of Eleanor. She highlighted Eleanor's reaction to the affair in the book and discussed the personal parallels she saw between the two of them.

""Part of the reason that I admire Eleanor Roosevelt is the way she handled that, happening to her.

WARREN TALES VEILED SHOT AT HILLARY OVER 2016 DEBATE PERFORMANCE AGAINST TRUMP

The documented affair between FDR and Lucy Mercer, whom Eleanor Roosevelt had hired as a social secretary, supposedly lasted at least a couple of years beginning in 1916. Historians said Eleanor learned about the infidelity in 1918 but agreed to stay with him on two conditions: he had to end the affair and could no longer sleep with his wife.

Clinton also discussed her personal feelings about her upset loss to President Trump in 2016 and used the venue to bash her former opponent, while throwing her support behind House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry.

""I believe [Trump] knows he’s an illegitimate president,"" Clinton continued. ""There were a bunch of different reasons why the election turned out the way it did, and I take responsibility for those parts of it that I should -- but it was like applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado."""

On the roster: Dems try to stay on offense - Thornberry out as Texodus continues - Booker beats his benchmark - Don’t get sideways with this bear



DEMS TRY TO STAY ON OFFENSE

Politico: “House Democrats are plotting an all-out offensive against President Donald Trump as they pursue an impeachment inquiry, announcing plans on Sunday to streamline their messaging operation and aid vulnerable lawmakers as they face potential blowback in their districts. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies laid out the strategy during a private conference call Sunday afternoon. The plan reflects a deepening sentiment among Democrats that Trump’s latest scandal involving Ukraine could persuade the public to support impeachment. But it also underscores longstanding concerns that an impeachment push could jeopardize some of the toss-up seats in 2020 that helped the party win the majority last year. … Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, who leads House Democrats’ campaign arm, advised the caucus’ most vulnerable members to gauge support and test their message through polling in their respective districts…”



No recess from impeachment pressure for House Dems - NYT: “Orange County was the epicenter of the 2018 House Democratic takeover, where Republicans lost four seats in what was once the heart of Ronald Reagan conservatism in California. On Saturday night, as three of the victorious Democrats were honored at an annual political dinner, a new battle was on everyone’s minds: How to protect those gains in 2020 by selling voters on the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. At the dinner, Representative Harley Rouda warned Democrats not to ‘sit on our laurels.’ Representative Mike Levin solemnly said ‘the times have found us.’ And Representative Gil Cisneros, who came out for the inquiry only last week, plugged his campaign website twice to ask for donations and noted, ‘The Republicans are coming after me now.’ A tricky balancing act is now underway for House Democrats as they return to their districts for a two-week recess that will double as a crucial time to frame a coast-to-coast debate over impeachment and the nation’s priorities.”



Pergram: Meanwhile, back at the House - Fox News: “The House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees will continue to toil behind the scenes investigating and, eventually, crafting actual articles of impeachment. More on that in a moment. … The subpoenas are part of a two-pronged strategy by Democrats. Get the information to help tailor the articles of impeachment, or convert a refusal to comply into an impeachment article itself. House Democrats say the recess period is important to educate the public about the impeachment process and to gin up support for it.”



McConnell says ‘no choice’ but for Senate to take up impeachment - USA Today: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to put forward articles of impeachment. The Kentucky Republican told CNBC that the obligation to hold a trial is part of Senate rules and it would take a two-thirds vote of the chamber to change that. ‘I would have no choice but to take it up a based on a Senate rule on impeachment,’ McConnell said. … While the Constitution puts the responsibility of holding an impeachment trial in the hands of the Senate, there has been some speculation that McConnell might refuse to hold a trial.”



Biden wants a Giuliani ban - NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign contacted top television anchors and networks on Sunday to ‘demand’ that Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, be kept off the air because of what they called his misleading comments about the Biden family and Ukraine. ‘We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,’ a pair of top Biden campaign advisers, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, wrote in the letter. ‘Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,’ the advisers wrote. The note, which was obtained by The New York Times, was sent to executives and top political anchors at ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and NBC, including star interviewers like Jake Tapper, Chuck Todd and Chris Wallace.”



Trump’s scorched earth attacks turn off some on his side - WaPo: “Sunday started with President Trump’s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, saying he was ‘deeply disturbed’ by the implications of his call to the Ukrainian president and ended with a GOP congressman, Adam Kinzinger, calling one of Trump’s tweets ‘beyond repugnant.’ While key Republicans have rallied to the president’s defense since House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry last week, the bookends to the day underscore the riskiness of a scorched-earth defense strategy that is predicated on an insistence that Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. The president is running the smashmouth playbook he learned from Roy Cohn, his mentor and Joe McCarthy’s hatchet man. It’s worked repeatedly for Trump, from fighting the Justice Department’s investigation of racial discrimination at his family’s rental properties in the 1970s to overcoming Bob Mueller’s investigation the past two years.”



It's 1998 redux, but will the economy play along? - Politico: “The U.S. economy has sailed through a presidential impeachment before. In 1998, as the GOP-controlled House moved to impeach President Bill Clinton, the stock market soared and the economy grew nearly 5 percent. But economists and Wall Street analysts note that conditions are very different now as Democrats push toward a possible impeachment of President Donald Trump. During the Clinton impeachment, the dot com boom was making Americans exuberant about the economy. Today, the economy is slowing, consumer confidence is dipping and corporate America faces a gauntlet of worries including the trade war with China, the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement and slowing growth around the world. And now investors, consumers and corporate executives face the prospect of a Washington consumed for months by impeachment drama and the uncertain reactions of a volatile president with a penchant for lashing out under stress.”

TIME OUT: ‘JANUARY BELONGS TO KALE’

Atlantic: “January belongs to kale. This annual vegetable cycle shows up in the past decade of Google Trends data, which compiles how frequently Americans trawl the internet for information about certain terms. Since about 2011, when Gwyneth Paltrow taught the world how to make kale chips on the Ellen show, kale has entered into the cultural lexicon as a status symbol for a generation of young adults drawn to conspicuous health-consciousness. … But kale’s cultural ubiquity might not be exactly what it seems. After kale briefly overtook spinach as America’s favorite cooked green in mid-2014, Google’s measure of interest in kale has steadily declined. The green’s digital fortunes are currently back at about where they were in 2011… Search data aren’t the end-all-be-all measurement of popularity, but the more leads you follow, the more you begin to question the narrative of kale’s dominance. In fact, America might never have been that into kale in the first place.”

THORNBERRY OUT AS TEXODUS CONTINUES

Texas Tribune: “U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection in 2020, making him the sixth GOP congressman from Texas to say he's retiring in recent weeks. ‘It has been a great honor for me to represent the people of the 13th District of Texas for the last 25 years,’ he said in a statement. ‘We are reminded, however, that ‘for everything there is a season,’ and I believe that the time has come for a change. Therefore, I will not be a candidate for reelection in the 2020 election.’ Thornberry joins five other Texas Republicans in Congress who are not running for reelection — U.S. Reps. Kenny Marchant, Pete Olson, Mike Conaway, Will Hurd and Bill Flores. But Thornberry's exit is somewhat different from other Republicans' shocking retirements over the summer. The last remaining Texan from the class of 1994 and the dean of the GOP delegation, Thornberry was expected by many to retire soon. He will turn over his post leading the Republican side of the House Armed Services Committee in January 2021, thanks to Republican term limits for committee chairmanships.”

The Bern has lost its glow - Politico: “With just four months until the first-in-the-nation caucuses, [Bernie] Sanders is in trouble. As he delivered his populist gospel to large crowds of camouflage-clad high schoolers, liberal arts college students, and trade union members across Iowa last week, a problematic narrative was hardening around him: His campaign is in disarray and Elizabeth Warren has eclipsed him as the progressive standard-bearer of the primary. He’s sunk to third place nationally, behind Warren and Joe Biden, and some polls of early nomination states show him barely clinging to double digits. He’s shaken up his staffs in Iowa and New Hampshire. He’s lost the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a left-wing group that backed him in 2016, to Warren. … Sanders is still a top-tier candidate, and many voters haven’t made up their minds yet. But time is starting to run short.”



Biden dials back digital ads - NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms. In a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden’s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors who are especially engaged on social media. Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists.”



Biden looks for Hispanic Caucus to break his way - Politico: “The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has largely stayed out of the presidential primary so far — partly out of respect for Julián Castro, the only Latino in the race and the brother of CHC Chairman Joaquin Castro. But with Julián languishing at the bottom of polls with around 1 percent support, at least a handful of the group’s 38 members are on the verge of announcing their support for Joe Biden, according to sources familiar with the effort. Their impact could provide an adrenaline boost in a Democratic contest where most campaigns are struggling to win over Hispanic voters — a bloc that will play a key role in early-state Nevada and on Super Tuesday. … Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris currently lead the Democratic primary field in CHC endorsements with three apiece.”



Dems head to K Street to fund convention - Politico: “Two top operatives planning the Democratic Party’s 2020 convention in Milwaukee went to K Street last week to pitch lobbyists on their plans for the $70 million event. Against the backdrop of the Democratic primary, it was an awkward pairing — representatives for special interests meeting with top Democrats while the party’s leading presidential candidates reject corporate PAC and lobbyist cash. But Democratic National Committee officials explained during the meeting how corporations can help foot the bill for the convention, regardless of who the nominee is, addressing some lobbyists’ worries that a crusading left-wing nominee like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could try to reject corporate money, embarrassing convention sponsors. The DNC doesn’t plan to return any corporate money that is donated to the convention regardless of the nominee, convention CEO Joe Solmonese told POLITICO.”

DON’T GET SIDEWAYS WITH THIS BEAR

NY Post: “A black bear with a discerning palate was caught on camera munching on grapes in a California vineyard – but only picking out those used for Pinot Noir, according to a report. Video shows the refined mammal stomping around Navarro Vineyards in Philo, Calif., and stopping to pick at the Pinot Noir vines – ignoring the eight other grape varieties grown at the winery. ‘He will go for the premium fruit,’ Aaron Bennett, co-owner of the family business told the Los Angeles Times. The booze-loving beast has been using the vineyard as his personal snack bar for years, but the business only recently caught the fiend in the act on security footage. ‘Navarro’s taste-tester is back to ‘get it when the gettin’ is good,’’ the business posted on Facebook last week, along with security footage of the bear. … The bear may be drawn to the specific grapes because they are grown in a remote part of the vineyard. Or maybe he just has good taste, Bennett said.”

The crypto whiz kid who paid $4.6 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett, only to postpone at the last minute, will endorse Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie's shoes this season.

Tron and BitTorrent CEO Justin Sun will pay 8.2 bitcoins — worth about $66,000 at the time of writing — that the basketball player has pledged to donate to his charity. Dinwiddie wears a fresh set of custom sneakers each game — past pairs have honored Stan Lee, Colin Kaepernick, and Barack Obama — then auctions them and gives a portion of the proceeds to the Dinwiddie Family Foundation, according to the LA Times.

""This year Id like to announce an endorsement with @Tronfoundation and @justinsuntron. 8.2btc (.1btc/game) for my 2019/2020 game worn shoes. And in the essence of transparency I pledge that same 8.2btc to charity! This will allow us to continue to expand our mission to help youth!"" Dinwiddie tweeted.

Twitter/Spencer Dinwiddie

Dinwiddie has previously invested in Tron's cryptocurrency, according to Bleacher Report. He was planning to launch a digital token giving investors a piece of his $34.4 million contract, but the National Basketball Association has smacked the idea down, according to the New York Times.

After the NBA rejected his idea, Dinwiddie confirmed his deal with Sun was still on. ""Also, in case you were worried I'm still going to give the 8.2btc to charity from my shoes lol,"" he tweeted.

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang expressed disappointment at the NBA's decision. ""I think @SDinwiddie_25 selling interests in his professional earnings is genius and am disappointed the NBA is disallowing it,"" he tweeted.

The pair have exchanged friendly tweets in the past, with Dinwiddie saying ""you may have gained a vote"" after Yang tweeted about the Brooklyn Nets, leading them to make plans to meet at a game this fall.

Sun has also expressed support for Yang's policies. After the candidate pledged to give $1,000 a month to 10 American families over the next year, Sun tweeted he would give the same amount to 100 families — a total of $1.2 million —next year. On a livestream last week, Sun said he would message Yang about a potential partnership.

Dinwiddie isn't Sun's first basketball connection. Kobe Bryant, the former Los Angeles Lakers star, was the guest speaker at Tron's Nitron Summit in January.

Sun, a protégé of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, invited high-profile crypto personalities including Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Huobi CEO Livio Weng — as well as President Donald Trump — to his charity lunch with Buffett. However, he postponed the meal three days before it was scheduled, blaming a bout of kidney stones.

Sun apologized on Chinese social media for overhyping himself, and Tron employees were briefly detained by officials in China, according to Bloomberg, fueling conspiracies he was in trouble with the Chinese government. He expects to reschedule the Buffett lunch ""very soon,"" he said on the livestream."

Some investors and analysts are growing increasingly concerned about the prospect of democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren taking the White House in 2020.

Any hit to the stock market from a Warren presidency will likely be temporary, RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients on Monday.

Most of the concerns about a Warren presidency stem from the Senator's policy positions on regulating industries such as health care, banking, and energy.

Visit the Markets Insider homepage for more stories.

Wall Street is getting worried about the potential impact of an Elizabeth Warren presidency on the stock market.

But RBC Capital Markets says any pain will likely be short-lived.

Much of the concern surrounding a potential Warren presidency stems from the democratic senator's position on regulating industries such as health care, banking, and energy.

According to RBC, while the broader stock market seems expensive, the industries most vulnerable to Warren's policy plans are deeply undervalued.

""Ultimately we think corporate America and US equity investors would learn to adapt to new political leadership, as they always do,"" said Lori Calvasina, the head of US equity strategy, in a note to clients.

""The stock market tends to go up over time, regardless of who occupies the White House.""

RBC also said that if Warren secures the democratic nomination, the risk of her presidency will likely unravel in the market well before election day.

Warren has proposed a broad range of policies including stricter guidelines for Wall Street banks, a ban on fracking, and a dramatic transition away from private health care providers. While Warren's push for increased regulation could pose a threat to some industries, a democratic presidency could also present some positive themes for US equity investors, RBC added.

""The election of a progressive Democrat seems supportive of the already growing popularity of ESG as an investment approach, since issues like climate change and fair pay could be in the spotlight,"" the firm said in a note to clients on Monday.

Dividends could also become more popular as share buybacks typically lose political favor under democrats, RBC added.

* Late Friday afternoon, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign said the Vermonter was hospitalized following a heart attack in Las Vegas last week. There is no reason to believe this will derail the 78-year-old senator’s presidential campaign, though he is now at home recuperating.

* The latest Fox News poll in South Carolina shows Joe Biden with a sizable lead over his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. The results showed the former vice president with 41%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 12% and Bernie Sanders at 10%.

* Fox News yesterday also released its latest poll out of Wisconsin, where Biden leads Warren by a much narrower margin, 28% to 22%, with Sanders not far behind with 18%. The same survey showed each of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination leading Donald Trump in Wisconsin in hypothetical match-ups, with Biden enjoying the largest advantage (nine points) and Warren enjoying the smallest lead over the president (four points).

* The Warren presidential campaign announced late last week that it has fired its national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, after an investigation into “multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior.”

* As of this morning, it appears that Sen. Cory Booker and Tom Steyer have qualified to participate in the Democratic presidential primary debate in November, bringing the new total of participants to seven. In contrast, 12 candidates are slated to appear in next week’s debate.

* Biden wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post, responding to Trump’s offensive against him, and it concluded, “[T]o Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.”

* Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters on Friday that if Warren is elected president, Power isn’t ruling out the possibility of running for her seat.

* And in a curious tweet, later promoted by Donald Trump, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel suggested donor support is most important indicator of the president’s public standing, arguing, “Dollars are the real polls right now.”"

* In South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary, the latest CNN poll shows Joe Biden maintaining his lead with 37% support, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 16% and Bernie Sanders at 11%. No other candidate topped 5%.

* In Nevada, meanwhile, CNN’s poll found Biden and Sanders tied at 22% each, while Warren was third at 18%. Kamala Harris was fourth with 5%.

* Cory Booker’s team suggested the New Jersey senator would end his Democratic presidential campaign if it fell short of its quarterly fundraising goals, but Booker announced via Twitter that his operation reached its target.

* Though competitive presidential candidates from both parties have steered clear of accepting public financing in recent years, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock will apparently become the first Democratic contender to participate in the system.

* In South Carolina, CNN’s poll found 62% percent of Republican voters approve of their state party’s decision to cancel the GOP presidential primary. That’s an unflattering rebuke of Mark Sanford, the former governor and congressman from South Carolina, who’s challenging Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.

* For reasons I cannot explain, the National Republican Congressional Committee thought it’d be a good idea to publicly mock freshman Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.) for having been to marriage counseling with his wife.

* A day after saying he intended to scale back his campaign schedule in the wake of his heart attack, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told NBC News yesterday he “misspoke” and intends to “get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.”

* On a related note, the Vermont senator said he knew about the heart attack for a few days before it was disclosed to the public, but Sanders added that he’s nevertheless comfortable with the way his campaign handled the matter. “No apologies,” he said.

* Joe Biden yesterday made an unequivocal statement in support for Donald Trump’s impeachment, a step he’d previously been reluctant to take.

* On a related note, the former vice president’s campaign sent a written complaint to New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet yesterday, questioning the newspaper’s decision to publish an op-ed from Peter Schweizer and pointing to what Team Biden sees as a larger pattern of “journalistic malpractice.”

* And speaking of Biden’s campaign, it also reached out to Facebook about taking down a Trump campaign attack ad that includes demonstrably false claims. The social-media giant refused.

* Despite having qualified for next week’s Democratic presidential primary debate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is now saying she may boycott the event in order to protest a process she believes is “rigged” against her and candidates like her.

* Speaking of Minnesota, a new Star Tribune poll found Donald Trump trailing each of the top Democratic contenders in 2020 match-ups. Despite the president’s recent insistence that he expects to win Minnesota next year, the poll showed him trailing Warren by nine points, Biden by 12 points, and Klobuchar by 17 points.

I think Nate Silver makes a good point when he says that there are some candidates in the contest for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination who are doing better than expectations but only Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are actually doing well. They’re really the only ones who can be satisfied that they’re meeting their own expectations for progress. We’re almost to the point that we can begin to think of this as a two-person race.

In looking at national polls pre- and post-September 23 (the date Silver uses as the beginning of the impeachment process), there are a few interesting observations we can make. The first is that Biden is actually slightly up despite having his name dragged through the mud. It would probably be fairer to say that he’s holding steady, but there’s no sign in erosion. This appears to be the case for most of the candidates, too, as the majority of them, like Biden, are up or down less than a point.

But that doesn’t mean the polls have been static. Elizabeth Warren has gained a substantial 5.7 percent and is now nearing parity with Biden. Almost all of her gains appear to have come from Kamala Harris (down 2.6 percent), Cory Booker (down 1.3 percent) and Bernie Sanders (down 1.1 percent).

Sanders is actually weathering the fallout from his heart attack surprisingly well, but his campaign has been losing slow and steady ground to Warren for a couple of months now. He’s now looking like a second tier candidate, albeit the only second tier candidate in the race. The real news here is that Kamala Harris has fallen to 4.7 percent in the national polls. This appears to be fatal to her campaign hopes, as she really need to move upward into the teens to sustain a serious operation.

I suspect Harris doesn’t have much time to right her ship, but there is one small hopeful sign. She’s seems to have lost the battle with Warren for voters who were undecided between the two of them, but she’s also the logical landing point for these voters if Warren’s campaign badly falters in the coming months. I think her model was more reliant on Biden faltering so she could pick up some fleeing moderates, but at this point I think she’d need both Warren and Biden to collapse to get back into contention.

National polls only tell part of the story, of course. In Iowa, Warren has led in two of three recent polls and Sanders remains very much in the running. In New Hampshire, Warren had led in all three of the most recent polls and Sanders has slipped into a distant third place. Yet, Biden enjoys a narrow lead in Nevada (where Bernie Sanders looks competitive) and a massive lead in South Carolina.

Since there’s an advantage to winning the earliest contests, I think Warren looks like she’s in the best position right now. But she doesn’t have Iowa locked down by an means (RCP Avg. Warren 22.7, Biden 19.3, Sanders 16.0).

For both Biden and Sanders, it would be a very bad development if Warren were to win Iowa because it would probably solidify her advantage in New Hampshire and give her a sweep of the first two contests. Sanders would be effectively knocked out, I think, because it will kill his chances in Nevada and any chance of coming in second place in South Carolina. Biden is in a better position to recover from losing the first two (or even three) battles because of his strong lead in South Carolina. If he were to lose in Iowa and New Hampshire (and perhaps Nevada as well), I’m not sure that his lead in the Palmetto State would hold up, and it certainly would narrow.

While Sanders probably needs to win Iowa in order to survive, Biden would be in a decent position losing there provided that the winner were anybody other than Warren.

I suppose there is still plenty of time for the top three candidates to stumble or for a lower tier candidate to catch fire, but the eventual dynamics of the race seems to be coming into view. Iowa looks huge. As I wrote back on September 19, Kamala Harris has put all her chips on Iowa, so it will be decisive for her campaign. That appears to be the case for Sanders, too. Warren will be sitting pretty if she wins the Hawkeye State but in much more of a dogfight if she does not. And Biden really needs to avoid an outcome where Warren carries the first two states.

This is a very stupid way to decide a nomination. I’ve written that the Iowa caucuses are a fraud and should be doomed. It’s a subject that I will no doubt return to many times before Iowan Democrats turn out in the cold next winter to decide the fate of the country.

For now, I’ll just remind you of what happened in Iowa in 2012.

…an initial and preliminary count of the votes indicated that Mitt Romney had won the caucuses by eight votes. And that is how the media reported it. Yes, Rick Santorum had come out of nowhere to finish a shockingly strong second place, but he hadn’t won anything. Romney, who had suffered the indignity of lagging behind in the polls (at one time or another) to everyone in the race except Santorum, had managed to right his ship and avoid a bad stumble out of the gate. This was hugely helpful to him as the contest moved to Romney’s home turf in New Hampshire. Remember, not only had he served as governor in neighboring Massachusetts, but he owned a home in New Hampshire. Two weeks later, however, and after Romney romped to victory in the Granite State, the Iowa Republican Party had to make two embarrassing announcements. The first was that they had finalized counting the votes and that it turned out that Rick Santorum didn’t have an eight vote deficit but instead a 34-vote lead. The second announcement was that it was impossible to actually declare a winner [because results from eight of 1,774 precincts could not be located for certification] …In 2012, Iowa had 28 delegates at the convention, and according to the New York Times, Ron Paul got 22 of them, Romney got five, and Rick Santorum got zero. One vote is listed as undetermined but probably went for Romney… …you can justifiably say that Santorum won Iowa because he had the most votes in the certified count, or that Romney won because he benefited the most from the result, or that Ron Paul won because he actually got almost all the delegates, or that no one won because the party refused to declare a winner.

The Democratic caucuses operate with slightly different rules in Iowa, but it remains a beauty contest where the delegates are not decided or committed to any candidate regardless of results. It literally does not matter who wins in determining how the delegates will be awarded. Yet, the perception that someone won has a gigantic impact on the media coverage, and next year this looks to be truer and more consequential than ever."
192,Nancy LeTourneau,,A retreat from Medicare for All is no longer an option.,2019-10-17,Google News,Warren Has Boxed Herself in on Health Care,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/washingtonmonthly/rss/~3/1Gx1vlBJSUA/,"AFGE/Flickr

Elizabeth Warren has made a name for herself by being the candidate who has a plan for everything. That is precisely why people have taken notice of the fact that the one area where she hasn’t proposed a plan is health care. The speculation has been that, while she is vigorously supporting Medicare for All during the debates, she is leaving the door open to support other plans down the road if that position becomes a liability.

Immediately after Warren announced her candidacy, she stated that the goal was universal coverage and that there were many paths to get there. Following the September debate in which she defended Medicare for All, she said that she supported a lot of plans.

Asked if she will present her own health care plan, @senwarren says she already supports Medicare for All: ""This isn't some kind of contest"" #DemDebate https://t.co/Ffui0utwux pic.twitter.com/dIhqHZxGTK — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 13, 2019

But once again on Tuesday night, Warren repeated her vigorous defense of Medicare for All. Given that she has now done so in every debate, Walter Shapiro suggests that she might not be able to pivot.

In fact, the arena where Warren has been uncharacteristically vague is in failing to provide full details of her “I’m with Bernie” support for his Medicare for All. Her stance on the issue could be risky (particularly as she must win over upscale voters who might not want their private health insurance to be abolished). But, worse still, if Warren were to retreat now, it would seem like a patently political move rather than a principled one—which would undermine what makes her campaign so unique.

The candidate who has offered the best challenge to Medicare for All in the debates has consistently been Pete Buttigieg, with his “Medicare for All Who Want It” proposal. Here is how it is described on his web site.

Through Pete’s Medicare for All Who Want It plan, everyone will be able to opt in to an affordable, comprehensive public alternative. This affordable public plan will incentivize private insurers to compete on price and bring down costs. If private insurers are not able to offer something dramatically better, this public plan will create a natural glide-path to Medicare for All. The choice of a public plan empowers people to make their own decisions regarding the type of health care that makes sense for them by leveling the playing field between patients and the health care system. It gives the American people a choice and trusts them to set the pace at which our country moves in a better direction on health care.

Back in February, Warren said that “There are multiple bills on the floor in the United States Senate. I’ve signed onto Medicare for All. I’ve signed on to another one that gives an option for buying in to Medicaid. There are different ways we can get [to universal coverage].” But in Tuesday night’s debate, Warren referred to Buttigieg’s proposal as “Medicare for all who can afford it” and said that she would never support such a plan.

At this point, Warren is pretty much locked in to the Sanders Medicare for All plan. It grows increasingly difficult to imagine how she can back away from that position without destroying the image she wants to convey of herself as a “fighter.”"
193,Martin Longman,,"If Sanders or Warren were to become president, they'd struggle to pass the plans proposed by Biden and Buttigieg and be accused of Leninism for even trying.",2019-10-16,Google News,I Hate to Admit the Moderates are Right About Medicare-for-All,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/washingtonmonthly/rss/~3/YlsY_9EEgkw/,"Senate Democrats/Flickr

While there are some legitimate concerns that can be raised about Medicare-for-All on the merits—as opposed to on the politics—I am not convinced that it’s a problem that some people, like members of organized labor, have worked hard to negotiate good private health care plans. To me, this is a bit like arguing that we don’t need to eliminate Lyme disease because we can treat it with antibiotics. There is simply no value-added by having a profit or commercial basis to health insurance. If it is to exist at all, it should be strictly as a supplemental product.

But that’s an ideological opinion of mine and not a strategic analysis of what the Democrats should be pursuing on the health care front during the 2020 campaign. Watching the CNN debate on Tuesday night, I agreed with Warren and Sanders on the merits, but I thought the moderates had the better argument.

I have three concerns about pushing for Medicare-for-All right now. The first is that it’s obviously controversial and has big political vulnerabilities. Sanders freely admits that to pay for it will require taxes to go up on everybody who pays taxes, including the middle class. Warren is more reluctant to acknowledge this, although she doesn’t outright deny it. What they both argue, instead, is that overall costs will go down for the middle class because they will no longer have to pay premiums, co-pays, or out-of-pocket costs. This is most likely true in a general sense, although on an individual basis it might depend on how much health care someone uses in a given year. So, one problem lies in convincing people that a tax hike will benefit them, especially when it is not guaranteed that it will.

Another problem is the same one we see anytime health care reforms are proposed. People freak out about losing plans or access to doctors they like or having to wait in a queue to get treatment. This vulnerability isn’t avoidable or a good argument for not pursuing reforms but it does make it risky to propose something as disruptive as the abolishment of all private insurance. For me, this means that you should never propose something like this unless you’re serious about putting all your muscle behind it. And that gets to my third concern.

There is a basic cost-benefit error here. The chances of pushing a Medicare-for-All plan through the next Congress are almost nil. The Democrats would either have to overcome a Senate filibuster or they’d have to eliminate the legislative filibuster altogether. Let’s examine both of those scenarios.

The Democrats would need 60 votes to end a filibuster and they couldn’t get that many votes even if they won every competitive or semi-competitive Senate race next year. So, we can rule this out.

To end the legislative filibuster, they’d need 50 votes and the vice-president breaking a tie. But the Democrats will be lucky to have more than 51 or 52 seats even in a total landslide election. The problem here is that they’re unlikely to have enough unanimity in their caucus to end the legislative filibuster unless they can get closer to 55-57 seats. That’s both because senators are institutionally opposed to the change and because moderates get two valuable things out of the filibuster. First, it prevents radical legislation from passing which would endanger their political careers. Second, it puts them in the strongest negotiating position because they are the ones who can cut deals with Republicans (or so they like to think).

So, it’s not likely that the legislative filibuster will be eliminated by the next Congress. If it is, it will probably be after the first and most important year when even the moderates have to acknowledge that the rule is crippling their new president.

So, on a cost-benefit basis, there are easily identifiable downsides to proposing something that makes people apprehensive and that can be easily attacked and mischaracterized. What I can’t find is the upside. Where is the benefit in proposing something you won’t be able to enact?

And it’s not just the filibuster that makes it hard to enact. It’s also the lack of unanimity about it in the Democratic caucuses. I’m not at all certain that Nancy Pelosi could pass Medicare-for-All through the House. In the Senate, there could be a dozen or more Democratic senators who would never sign off on it. If the idea is to move the Overton Window to make Medicare-for-All more popular, that’s the job of a message candidate, not a candidate who plans on being the nominee.

This lack of unanimity was definitely on display during the debate last night when candidates like Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar all attacked Warren for proposing Medicare-for-All. That footage will be manna from heaven for Donald Trump or whoever runs in his stead next year. We can be angry about Democrats echoing Republican talking points, undermining support for Medicare-for-All, prattling about budget deficits, and giving ammunition to the GOP for the 2020 campaign. But we can also be angry that we have serious potential nominees who couldn’t predict these problems and avoid them.

What’s particularly annoying is that if Sanders or Warren were to become president, they’d probably struggle to pass the plans proposed by Biden and Buttigieg and be accused of Leninism for even trying. That’s the best they could hope to do, and they’d be exceeding my expectations if they succeeded. So, all this is is a big fat political weakness that has no discernible upside at all.

And I simply can’t understand why anyone would gift a person like Donald Trump something he can grab and beat them with. It’s dumb politics and for once the moderates have the better side of an argument."

The crypto whiz kid who paid $4.6 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett, only to postpone at the last minute, will endorse Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie's shoes this season.

Tron and BitTorrent CEO Justin Sun will pay 8.2 bitcoins — worth about $66,000 at the time of writing — that the basketball player has pledged to donate to his charity. Dinwiddie wears a fresh set of custom sneakers each game — past pairs have honored Stan Lee, Colin Kaepernick, and Barack Obama — then auctions them and gives a portion of the proceeds to the Dinwiddie Family Foundation, according to the LA Times.

""This year Id like to announce an endorsement with @Tronfoundation and @justinsuntron. 8.2btc (.1btc/game) for my 2019/2020 game worn shoes. And in the essence of transparency I pledge that same 8.2btc to charity! This will allow us to continue to expand our mission to help youth!"" Dinwiddie tweeted.

Twitter/Spencer Dinwiddie

Dinwiddie has previously invested in Tron's cryptocurrency, according to Bleacher Report. He was planning to launch a digital token giving investors a piece of his $34.4 million contract, but the National Basketball Association has smacked the idea down, according to the New York Times.

After the NBA rejected his idea, Dinwiddie confirmed his deal with Sun was still on. ""Also, in case you were worried I'm still going to give the 8.2btc to charity from my shoes lol,"" he tweeted.

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang expressed disappointment at the NBA's decision. ""I think @SDinwiddie_25 selling interests in his professional earnings is genius and am disappointed the NBA is disallowing it,"" he tweeted.

The pair have exchanged friendly tweets in the past, with Dinwiddie saying ""you may have gained a vote"" after Yang tweeted about the Brooklyn Nets, leading them to make plans to meet at a game this fall.

Sun has also expressed support for Yang's policies. After the candidate pledged to give $1,000 a month to 10 American families over the next year, Sun tweeted he would give the same amount to 100 families — a total of $1.2 million —next year. On a livestream last week, Sun said he would message Yang about a potential partnership.

Dinwiddie isn't Sun's first basketball connection. Kobe Bryant, the former Los Angeles Lakers star, was the guest speaker at Tron's Nitron Summit in January.

Sun, a protégé of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, invited high-profile crypto personalities including Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Huobi CEO Livio Weng — as well as President Donald Trump — to his charity lunch with Buffett. However, he postponed the meal three days before it was scheduled, blaming a bout of kidney stones.

Sun apologized on Chinese social media for overhyping himself, and Tron employees were briefly detained by officials in China, according to Bloomberg, fueling conspiracies he was in trouble with the Chinese government. He expects to reschedule the Buffett lunch ""very soon,"" he said on the livestream."

A longtime shareholder in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold his stake and published a laundry list of complaints about the legendary investor and his conglomerate.

David Rolfe, the investing chief of Wedgewood Partners, dumped his stock after more than 20 years, according to his third-quarter letter to clients. He blamed Buffett's failure to capitalize on gains in several stocks, bad investments, and reluctance to deploy his vast pile of cash.

""Thumb-sucking has not cut the Heinz mustard during the Great Bull Market of 2009 – 2019,"" Rolfe said in the letter. ""The Great Bull could have been one helluva of an astounding career denouement for Messrs. Buffett and Munger,"" he added, referring to Buffett's partner Charlie Munger.

Buffett missed out on multiple ""layups""

""A few stocks stand out to us as considerable head-scratcher errors that should have been in Buffett's wheelhouse, and should have been good for Berkshire shareholders,"" Rolfe said.

He highlighted Mastercard's 1,521% gain and Visa's 1,137% gain between the start of the bull market on March 9, 2009, and the end of last month. Then he bemoaned the fact those two stocks together make up just 1.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. ""The current combined weighting should be 15.00%!""

Rolfe also pointed to Costco and Microsoft as missed opportunities.

""Buffett has had at his disposal unrivaled expert tutelage on each company in his hind pocket for years — but to no shareholder avail,"" he said, spotlighting the fact that Munger has been a Costco director for 22 years. Yet Berkshire Hathaway only holds a ""whopping"" 0.55% stake, Rolfe added, meaning it's largely lost out on Costco's 522% gain during the bull market.

Rolfe also criticized the so-called Oracle of Omaha for not cashing in on Microsoft's 657% stock gain over the same period, despite his close relationship with Bill Gates, the technology titan's cofounder.

""Buffett probably spends more time talking with Gates (Gates Foundation and bridge playing too) each day than he does with key Berkshire vice-chairman employees Ajit Jain and Greg Abel,"" he said.

""If Buffett can endeavor to figure out the business models of both Apple and IBM enough to pour multi-billions in stock purchases, then figuring out Microsoft's business model under sensei Gates should have been Remedial Technology 101.""

Berkshire made several bad investments

""Recent billions in capital investments in notable mistakes such as IBM, Lubrizol, Precision Castparts and Kraft do not inspire confidence that Buffett & Co. are still at the top of their game,"" Rolfe said.

Buffett bought almost $11 billion worth of IBM stock at an average price of $170 in 2011, according to CNBC, only to sell his stake in the computing giant at a loss last year. He shelled out nearly $10 billion to buy Lubrizol in 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported, then later learned one of his lieutenants at the time bought a $10 million stake in the chemicals firm before recommending it to Buffett, according to the Guardian.

Berkshire Hathaway bought Precision Castparts at a $37 billion valuation in 2016, dwarfing the industrial manufacturer's $1.5 billion in annual earnings. The industrial manufacturer's profits have been lower than projected, Buffett said at his company's annual shareholder meeting in May. Buffett also admitted to CNBC he paid too much for Heinz to acquire Kraft, and the combined group's shares have plunged amid sales declines, accounting issues, and a $15 billion write-down this year.

Buffett hasn't put his cash to work

""Berkshire's current Breaking Bad-style cash hoard,"" Rolfe said, ""continues to be a considerable impediment of growth, rather than our previous hard expectation of a valuable call option on opportunity in the hands of one of the most elite capital allocators extant.""

He criticized Berkshire Hathaway for neither sharing its more than $120 billion in cash with investors nor plowing it into the market. ""Buffett seems to abhor returning 'capital paint' to shareholders while his Berkshire canvas is still 'in paint,'"" he said. Putting the cash to work ""will be paramount if Berkshire Hathaway is to once again regain their former status as a meaningful grower over just baseline US GDP growth.""

Rolfe ended by signaling his faith in Buffett could still be restored.

""Any future conviction of ours in Berkshire Hathaway shares will closely mirror that of Buffett's own conviction in Berkshire share buybacks.

Sun, a protégé of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, has invited crypto bosses such as Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire to the charity meal, as well as President Donald Trump. He dropped out three days before it was scheduled to take place, citing a bout of kidney stones.

However, Sun publicly apologized for overhyping himself on Chinese social media, and Bloomberg reported Tron employees were briefly detained by authorities in China, fueling conspiracies he was in trouble with the Chinese government.

Sun also discussed his proposed partnership with ""Andrew Yang and the Yang Gang"" on the stream.

During the last Democratic debate, the presidential candidate pledged to provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month to 10 Americans for the next year. Sun announced he would give the same amount to 100 people next year, invite one of the ""lucky 100"" to the Buffett lunch, and allow Yang to assist him in selecting the recipients.

* There was a lively Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio, last night. The next gathering will be in Georgia on Nov. 20.

* Bernie Sanders hasn’t picked up many congressional endorsements for his presidential campaign, but he’s now picking up two fairly high-profile backers: first-year Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

* Joe Biden’s campaign appears to have a rather serious financial problem: as the 2020 race enters the next stage, the former vice president only had about $9 million cash on hand as of two weeks ago. In contrast, Bernie Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank, Elizabeth Warren had $25.7 million, Pete Buttigieg had $23.3 million, and Kamala Harris had $10.5 million.

* With only three weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) tied with state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), with each garnering 46% support.

* On a related note, Bevin’s fate is reportedly of keen interest to the White House, and Team Trump is reportedly “planning an 11th-hour push to stave off an embarrassing defeat” for the far-right governor.

* And speaking of the Bluegrass State, a judge yesterday sided with the Kentucky Democratic Party and ordered State Board of Elections to keep 175,000 purged voters on the state’s voter rolls.

* In Maine., the latest survey from Public Policy Polling found Sen. Susan Collins (R) trailing a generic Democrat in next year’s U.S. Senate race, 41% to 44%. The incumbent Republican hasn’t yet officially declared whether she’ll run for another term.

* In a newly released audio recording, Texas state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) is heard telling a far-right activist that Donald Trump is “killing” the party “in the urban-suburban districts.”

* And though the president’s GOP primary rivals stand no realistic chance of success, it seemed notable that a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll found former Gov. Bill Weld with 14% support in New Hampshire, up from 3% in the same poll last month."

* A national Quinnipiac poll released yesterday found Elizabeth Warren holding onto her narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, 29% to 26%. Bernie Sanders was third with 16%, and no other candidate topped 5%.

* The same poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up by 11 points (51% to 40%), Warren leading Trump by eight points (49% to 41%), and Sanders leading him by seven points (49% to 42%).

* Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang was at 3% in the Quinnipiac poll, which means he’s now the eighth candidate to qualify for the Democrats’ presidential primary debate in November.

* On a related note, we learned yesterday that MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Nov. 20 in Georgia. As NBC News’ report on this added, “The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.”

* With just a few days remaining ahead of Louisiana’s first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, the latest Emerson poll found Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) leading the field with 48% – which is awfully close to the 50% threshold he’d need to avoid a runoff and serve a second term. Eddie Rispone (R) was second in the poll with 25%, followed by Ralph Abraham (R) at 19%.

* At home in Vermont yesterday, Bernie Sanders told reporters that in the wake of his heart attack that he’ll have to “change the nature of the campaign a bit.” The independent senator suggested the shift will mean holding fewer campaign events.

* Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is nothing if not shameless, his re-election campaign yesterday began promoting a Politico article pointing to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s alleged favoritism for Kentucky. Chao, of course, is McConnell’s wife. “Mitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset,” the senator’s team wrote in a tweet highlighting the report.

* Probate judge Steven Reed (D) made history yesterday, becoming the first African-American mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.

* And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) has thrown her endorsement to Joe Biden, looking past her fellow California senator, Kamala Harris. Feinstein had previously indicated support for Biden in January, but that was before most of the Democratic candidates had formally launched their campaigns. Biden now has five endorsements from sitting U.S. senators, more than any other Democratic candidate."

Kamala Harris, who had 4% support in the poll, was the only other candidate above 2%.

* Brad Parscale, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, yesterday described the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry as being “a seditious conspiracy to overthrow the people’s president.” He added that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is “attempting to overthrow our great Republic.” Parscale did not appear to be kidding.

* The New York Times published quite a report on the planned voter purge in Ohio’s Republican-led state government: “When Ohio released a list of people it planned to strike from its voting rolls, around 40,000 people shouldn’t have been on it. The state only found out because of volunteer sleuthing.” In all, Ohio intended to purge 235,000 Americans from the state voter rolls, and roughly one-in-five voters on the purge list weren’t supposed to be there.

Fox News Exclusive: Joe, Hunter Biden seen golfing with Ukraine gas company exec back in 2014, photo shows

A photo obtained by Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" shows former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings with Hunter. Earlier this month, Joe Biden told Fox News in Iowa that he never discussed his son’s foreign business dealings with him. “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden said, pointing the finger at President Trump. “I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader. You should be looking at Trump.”

Hunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken “just once” about his work in Ukraine. A source told Fox News the photo was taken in August 2014. News reports at the time indicated the vice president was in the Hamptons. Hunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma Holdings board in April 2014. Click here for more on our top story.

Giuliani blasts Biden camp for trying to 'silence' him; Pompeo listened in on Trump-Ukraine call: report

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president, a senior State Department official told the Wall Street Journal. The report would appear to support Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani's claims on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that Pompeo was aware of his efforts to encourage Ukraine’s government to investigate the Bidens. Over the weekend, the Democratic chairmen of three House committees subpoenaed Pompeo for documents related to Ukraine they said were critical to their probe.

House Democrats on Monday subpoenaed Giuliani's text messages, phone records, and other documents and communications as part of their formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump. In an interview on ""Hannity,"" Giuliani blasted the Biden camp for apparently trying to ""silence"" him by encouraging media outlets not to book him as a guest. The former New York City mayor said the Democrats are going to turn into the ""party of corruption."" Meanwhile, top Republicans are wondering whether Trump is a victim of a ""political setup"" by Democrats in the Ukraine call controversy, thanks to comments made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during her ""60 Minutes"" interview on Sunday.

Barr asked Trump to speak to other countries in probe of Russia investigation, official says; source pushes back on New York Times reporting

Separately, a Justice Department official told Fox News on Monday that Attorney General William Barr asked President Trump to make introductions to foreign countries that might have had information pertinent to U.S. Attorney John Durham's ongoing probe into the origins of the Russia collusion investigation and possible misconduct by the intelligence community. But, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News it would be wrong to say Trump ""pressed"" the Australian prime minister for information that could have discredited former Special Counsel Mueller's now-completed probe, as the New York Times reported earlier Monday.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., slammed the Times report on ""Hannity,"" calling it an ""effort"" to shut down Barr's investigation.

Fox News Exclusive: WinRed, new GOP donor platform, reaps impeachment windfall, rakes in millions

WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete with Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations, has raised over $28 million since launching three months ago, with top officials crediting the Democrats’ impeachment push for a big spike in fundraising over the last week, Fox News has learned. WinRed raised $28.1 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday. The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump’s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country.

Mega mall owners mull investing in Forever 21 after bankruptcy

Two mall titans may invest in the bankrupt teen retailer Forever 21. The retailer filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday morning and recently tried to cut a deal in which its two largest landlords, Brookfield Property and Simon Property, would take an ownership stake, according to the New York Post. The reason is Forever 21 uses a lot of mall space with its 541 stores. The nationwide closure of 178 locations would leave big holes at shopping malls. Negotiations between the retailer, Brookfield, and Simon reached an impasse over the weekend and are considered dead -- for now.

* With Donald Trump slated to hold a rally in Minneapolis this week, there’s apparently a brewing dispute between the president’s campaign team and local officials over security costs associated with the event.

* Speaking of Minnesota, Sen.

WALLACE: But is it a cease-fire or a surrender?

And --

MICK MULVANEY, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I have news for everybody. Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy.

WALLACE: Comments by the president's chief of staff trigger a firestorm over whether there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

We begin with breaking news. President Trump announced by tweet last night he's backing off his controversial decision to hold the G7 Summit next year at his own resort. He says the search will now begin for a new site.

But the president is still under fire even from a growing number of Republicans. GOP congressmen voted by more than 2-1 against his policy in Syria. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the president at a political quid pro quo from USA to Ukraine. Mulvaney later denied he said it, and more damaging testimony in the House impeachment investigation.

In a moment we will talk with the president chief of staff who just flinched when I said that.

But, first, let's bring in Kevin Corke with the latest from the White House -- Kevin.

KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, a precarious pause perhaps describes the tenuous nature of the circumstance on the ground in Syria as sporadic skirmishes continue to speckle the region, even as we learn much more about the U.S. strategy for American forces there.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARK ESPER, DEFENSE SECRETARY: The current game plan is for those forces to reposition into western Iraq, the ones coming out, right? That original 1,000. And then two missions -- one is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission.

Back in Washington, the impeachment drumbeat reached a fevered pitch as House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff interviewed a cascade of Trump administration officials but Ukraine and a possible quid pro quo tying USA aid to cooperation with a probe into the Biden's business dealings.

Incredibly, the gulf between House Democrats and the White House seem to grow, when Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stormed out of a White House meeting, accusing the president of having a meltdown over a bipartisan House vote rebuking his pullout in Syria. All as the president late Saturday rescinded his decision to host next year's G7 Summit at his resort in Miami, tweeting: Based on both media and Democrat crazed and irrational hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral Miami -- a reversal that came after withering criticism and accusations of self- dealing.

Can you at least understand and acknowledge that the -- just the appearance of impropriety makes us wince inducing and maybe this is something you maybe want to reconsider?

MULVANEY: He got over that a long time ago. We absolutely believe this is the best place to have it and we are going to have it there.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE: That was then, this is now. By the way, in that tweet, Chris, the president mentioned Camp David as a possible location for next year's G7 summit. It last hosted the G8 back in 2012 -- Chris.

WALLACE: Kevin Corke, reporting from the White House, Kevin, thanks from that.

Joining us now for an exclusive interview, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.

Mick, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"".

MULVANEY: Good morning.

Yes, I flinched a little bit because that's what people are saying that I said, but I didn't say that. But I'm looking forward to the conversation.

WALLACE: All right. Let's have a conversation.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Why -- here's my first question. Why did you say that in that briefing that President Trump had ordered a quid po qro (ph) -- quid pro quo, that investigating the Democrats, that aid to Ukraine depended on investigating the Democrats? Why did you say that?

MULVANEY: Again, that's not what I said. That's what people said I said.

Here's what I said, I'll say it again and hopefully people will listen this time.

There were two reasons that we held up the aid. We talked about this at some length. The first one was the rampant corruption in Ukraine. Ukraine -- by the way, Chris, it's so bad in Ukraine that in 2014, Congress passed a law making it -- making us -- requiring us to make sure that corruption was moving in the right direction. So, corruption is a big deal, everyone knows it.

The president was also concerned about whether or not other nations, specifically European nations, were helping with foreign aid to the Ukraine as well. We talked about that for quite a while now.

I did then mention that in the past, the president had mentioned for me to time to time about the DNC server. He had mentioned the DNC server to other people publicly. He even mentioned it to President Zelensky in the phone call, but it wasn't connected to the aid. And that's where I think people got sidetracked this weekend at that press conference.

WALLACE: But --

MULVANEY: Two reasons for holding back the aid --

WALLACE: Let me pursue that, though --

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: -- because I believe that anyone listening to what you said in that briefing could come to only one conclusion. Let's play what you said.

MULVANEY: Sure.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Did he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it, and that's what we held up the money.

REPORTER: What you just described is a quid pro quo. It is, funding will not flow unless the investigation into the -- into the Democrats' server happened as well.

MULVANEY: We do -- we do that all the time with foreign policy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl, was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aide?

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, it happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Yes. But go back and watch what I said before that. I don't know if you guys can cue it or not. There was a long answer about corruption and a long answer about foreign aid.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: No, you totally said that.

MULVANEY: Just like I told you then, and then I said the exact same thing I just said now, which is that he mentioned in passing yes, but the reason that we held back the aid with the two reasons I mentioned. And I can prove it to you. The aid flowed.

Once we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually -- they were doing better with it, we got that information from our folks from the conversation with Minister (ph) Zelensky and once we were able to establish we had the Office of Management and Budget do research on other countries' aid to Ukraine, it turns out they don't get any lethal aid, but they do give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid.

Once those two things were cleared, the money flowed. There was never any connection between the flow of money and the server.

WALLACE: But, Mick, you know, I hate to go through this, but you said what you said.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: And the fact is, after that exchange with Jonathan Karl, you were asked another time why the aide was held up. What was the condition for the aid? And you didn't mention two conditions, you mentioned three conditions.

And I want to -- and let's listen to all three of them because this -- you stated it very clearly. Let's listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Three issues for that. The corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That's completely legitimate.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Not only did you say that investigating the Democrats was one of the three conditions, not two, that you would just said that you would talk about, investigating the Democrats was part of the quid pro quo. You also said, if I may, it was part of the Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.

But the fact is that not only did the press think you said it, here's what a statement that was put out by a senior Justice Department official: If the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.

Everybody thinks that that's what you said and you didn't. You said right there --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- three points, not two.

MULVANEY: Well, and a couple different things. You again said just a few seconds ago that I said there was a quid pro quo. I never used that language, because there is not a quid pro quo, but --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: You were asked by Jonathan Karl, is -- you described a quid pro quo, and you said, that happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Well -- and reporters will use their language all the time. So, my language never said quid pro quo.

But let's get to the heart of the matter. Go back and look at that list of three things. What was I talking about? Things that was legitimate for the president to do.

Number one, it is legitimate for the president to want to know what's going on with the ongoing investigation into the server. Everybody acknowledges that -- at least I think most normal people do. It's completely legitimate to ask about that.

Number two, it's legitimate to tie the aid to corruption. It's legitimate to tie the aid to foreign aid from other countries. That's what I was talking about with the three.

Can I see how people took at the wrong way? Absolutely. But I never said there were was quid pro quo, because there isn't.

Again, Chris, you've been in these -- in these briefings. You know how back-and-forth is. You know how rapid-fire it is. Look to the facts on the ground, things that you can actually sort of certify.

And what should put this issue to bed is that the money flowed without any connection whatsoever to the DNC server.

WALLACE: But you -- in your first answer which I gave, you said that's why we held up the money. First, you just said here, that it was for two reasons. Now, you're acknowledging it was for three reasons.

If you held up the money for three reasons, that was -- that's a quid pro quo.

MULVANEY: I am not --

WALLACE: You got to satisfy us on those. Now, maybe the president backed off that, but that was the proposition here.

MULVANEY: I'm not acknowledging there's three reasons. Again, let's go back --

WALLACE: You said three reasons.

MULVANEY: Go back -- I recognize that. Go back to what actually happened in the real world.

And, by the way, go to the phone call, go to the phone call, which we've released. I hope you get a chance to talk about that before the --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I am going to right now.

MULVANEY: You go to the phone call, the president never mentions the aid at all in the phone call. Doesn't say, oh, by the way, I need you to do this, this, this and this or else the money won't flow.

We all know enough about this president that if he feels very strongly about something, he's going to put that out there directly and that didn't happen.

I recognize that folks -- that I didn't speak clearly maybe on Thursday, folks misinterpreted what I said, but the facts are absolutely clear and they are there for everyone to see.

WALLACE: In the briefing you flatly denied any connection between holding up the aide and investigating Joe Biden and his son, right?

MULVANEY: Correct.

WALLACE: OK. In his phone call with President Zelensky, however, President Trump specifically mentions the Bidens. Do me a favor. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani pushed all summer for Ukraine to announce it was investigating Burisma, the company that paid Hunter Biden.

And a former NSC official testified this week before Congress, John Bolton was so disturbed by the way you are directing people to work with Rudy Giuliani, he said, quote, I am not part of whatever drug deal -- he was speaking metaphorically --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- of whatever drug deal Sondland, the U.S. diplomat, and Mulvaney are cooking up.

No question you are following the president's orders, but your fingerprints are all over linking aid to Ukraine with investigating the Bidens.

MULVANEY: OK. No, that's not true. Let's go -- I'll take one of those of the time which is the Bolton thing, because I read that and I was surprised, because John Bolton never complained to me about it. No one at NSC ever complained to me about anything that was going on.

I didn't see Sondland's testimony this week because none of us have seen Sondland's testimony, which is another story entirely. I did get a chance to read his opening statement when he said that Bolton never complained to him. Fiona Hill never got a chance to complain to him.

I think you need to put sort of --

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Fiona Hill is the one who testified. That's the quote came from her.

MULVANEY: Who never complained to Sondland about what was happening, when it was happening.

WALLACE: No, she complained to her boss, John Bolton.

MULVANEY: Who did what?

WALLACE: Who said -- who told her to go immediately to a lawyer --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- at NSC and to complain about it.

MULVANEY: Who works for John Bolton. Yet John Bolton didn't go say anything to anybody. Doesn't that raise a red flag?

But let's go back to the first thing you talk about, which is the president's phone call, because at the end of the day, that's what this is really about, right? That's why we are here was the president phone call with Ukraine.

And you've done the same thing, and I don't blame you personally. Done the same thing with many news outlets have done. You said, do me a favor and then immediately to the Bidens.

Go look at the transcript of the phone conversation.

WALLACE: I have.

MULVANEY: It's, do me a favor, take a look at the DNC server. Then he talks about corruption in the Ukraine. He talks about Rudy Giuliani.

The president of the Ukraine gets on and he talks about a close cooperation between the countries. He talks about corruption. He talks about getting a new ambassador to the U.S.

And the president gets on and talks about Bill Barr. The president talks about a new ambassador between our countries, and then the very end of that passage mentions the Bidens.

Everybody else puts it on TV and says, do me a favor, look at the Bidens. And that's simply not factually accurate.

Go look at the transcript yourself.

WALLACE: Let's turn to Syria. Defense Secretary Esper overnight has said that those thousand troops who are being moved out of Syria are moving to Iraq. They are not as the president claimed coming home.

MULVANEY: Well, they will eventually. I think --

WALLACE: Eventually?

MULVANEY: The quickest way to get them out of danger was to get them into Iraq. Keep in mind what you are facing here. And I think literally the number was 28. You had 28 U.S. Special Forces between tens of thousands of soldiers on one side and tens of thousands of soldiers on the other side.

And I hope that when we release the letter this week, it put -- it put to the bed this nonsense about how the president supposedly green-lighted this invasion. Nothing would be further from the truth and I think the letter made that painfully clear.

WALLACE: No, no, the letter has been released.

MULVANEY: It has been, but I hope now people realize and -- it was -- listen, this is what we deal with this administration all the time. Whether it's on the impeachment or it's on the Ukraine or -- excuse me, on Syria, is people (ph) say, oh, there's a green light. The president green- lighted this and that's what the press reports.

And then we put out facts that absolutely put that to bed and no one comes back and says, well, we were wrong about that.

Go back to the beginning of the impeachment, how did that start, oh, there were supposedly a transcript with eight references to the Bidens and a quid pro quo on foreign aid -- absolutely false. No one ever went back and said, we were wrong about that either.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: So --

WALLACE: I do -- I'm running out of time and I do have several more questions.

MULVANEY: Lots of things to talk about.

WALLACE: Yes, we do.

I just want to go back to the briefing for one minute. After the briefing and all the blowback and the criticism, did you ever offer or think to offer the president your resignation?

MULVANEY: No, absolutely not.

WALLACE: Was that ever discussed?

MULVANEY: Absolutely, positively not.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: No, I'm -- listen, I'm very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference? No. But again, the facts were on our side.

I didn't get a chance to talk about some of the stuff I wanted to talk about at that press conference, which was, for example, Senator Menendez sending a letter to the Ukraine saying, if you don't cooperate with Mueller, there will be repercussions for you. I haven't had a chance to talk about -- talk about a quid pro quo, Joe Biden admitting that he said he was going to cut off funding unless the prosecutor got fired. If that's not a quid pro quo, I don't know what it is.

So, I haven't a chance at the presser to do everything I wanted to, but I still think I'm doing a pretty good job as the chief of staff and I think the president agrees.

WALLACE: There seems to be a growing number of Republicans in Congress who are -- if not breaking with the president, distancing themselves from the president.

You had Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who wrote a scathing article about Syria this week. I'm going to put up one of these quotes.

Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake and a strategic nightmare for our country.

House Republicans voted against the Trump policy in Syria 129-60, more than 2-1.

And I talked to a very well-connected Republican in Washington this week, somebody whose name you would know well, who says that if the House votes to impeach and it gets to a trial in the Senate, there is now a 20 percent chance he believes -- obviously, it's just an estimate -- now a 20 percent chance enough Republicans will vote with the Democrats to remove the president.

MULVANEY: Oh, that's just absurd. But let's deal with the issue of Syria.

WALLACE: No, let's deal with the issue of whether Republicans -- you're losing your support.

MULVANEY: Same thing. This comment about a 20 percent chance, the person clearly doesn't know what they're talking about.

But talk about the reaction of the Republicans and Democrats up on the Hill to the decision in Syria, president knew that was going to happen. He recognizes the fact that it's not a politically popular in this town to make the decision that he made to move the troops out of Syria. He ran on it. He told people he would do this if he won and he's doing it now because he won.

WALLACE: Forgive me for interrupting, we are running out of time, I just want to ask you, though -- is there any concern that the president is losing those support of Republicans in Congress?

MULVANEY: No, the president is extraordinary popular back home, more popular in the swing districts now that impeachment has started.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I'm talking about here in Washington.

MULVANEY: Yes, but they -- they have to go home eventually as well. So, no.

Do I have to understand that there are certain folks, especially the neoconservative wing of the party who are upset about the Syria decision? I absolutely do. The president knew that was going to happen.

Again, elections have consequences on foreign policy. That's where we started this conversation and that thankfully they do.

WALLACE: Two final questions. One, a -- one of the people who was testifying in Congress this week in the House impeachment investigation also said that he was so concerned about Hunter Biden getting that job in Ukraine in 2015 that he went to the vice president staff, Biden was then vice president, and said, this looks really bad. And that he was turned away.

Your reaction?

MULVANEY: Good. I'm surprised I haven't heard about it since. My guess is if it happened (ph) during the Trump administration, the news media would have reported on it at very next day.

WALLACE: I'm asking you about it, sir.

MULVANEY: I know you are. And I appreciate that. I'm hearing about it for the first time, I look forward to finding out more about it. It's the first I've heard of that piece of information.

WALLACE: You had not heard -- it's been reported widely in the last 48 hours.

MULVANEY: No, I've been busy in the last 48 hours, Chris.

WALLACE: OK. Well, let me ask you of something else, maybe you don't know this.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: But President Trump has decided after he put you out there in that briefing --

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: -- to announce Doral -- he is back -- he's decided that he's not going to hold it at Doral. He blames it on, quote, the hostile media and their Democratic partners.

But again, he was getting hammered by Republicans. So, why did he cave?

MULVANEY: I -- we talked about it at great length last night, and it's not lost on me that if we made the decision on Thursday, we wouldn't have had the press conference on Thursday regarding -- regarding everything else, but that's fine.

But we did talk about it last night and I honestly think what he is out in the tweet was real. The president isn't one for holding back his feelings and his emotions about something. He was honestly surprised at the level of pushback.

At the end of the day, you know, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world, and he wanted to put the absolute best show, the best visit that he possibly could. And he was very comfortable doing it at Doral, and I think we're all surprised at the level of pushback.

I think it's the right decision to change. We'll have to find someplace else. And my guess is we'll find someplace else that the media won't like either for another reason.

WALLACE: I just have to pick up -- you say he considers himself in the hospitality business.

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: He's the president of the United States.

MULVANEY: Yes, but he's -- that's his background. It's like, I used to be in the real estate business. I don't know what you used to do before you were in the media.

WALLACE: Nothing. That's all I've ever done.

MULVANEY: Yes.

But he wanted to put on a show. He wanted to take care of folks. That's the business -- he's in the hotel business or at least he was before he was the president.

WALLACE: Does he understand -- forget the media -- does he understand that it looked lousy?

MULVANEY: Well, I think he knows. He thinks people think it looks lousy.

Could we have put on an excellent G7 at Doral? Absolutely. Will we end up putting on an excellent G7 someplace else? Yes, we will.

WALLACE: Mick, thank you. Thanks for coming in. Always good to talk with you, sir.

MULVANEY: It's always good to be here. Thank you, sir.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss where the House impeachment investigation stands now. And new evidence U.S. officials were concerned as far back as 2015 about Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: For three straight years, radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great, great election -- maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump rallying supporters in Dallas against the House impeachment investigation.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz; FOX News political analyst Juan Williams; former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman; and from ""The Wall Street Journal"", Kimberley Strassel, author of the new book, ""Resistance (At All Cost"".

Well, Congressman Chaffetz, let me start with you. How damaging do you think the last week has been to President Trump? Testimony from a number of current and former national security officials that the president had Rudy Giuliani's personal lawyer running off-the-books operations when it came to Ukraine. And whatever you make of them, Mick Mulvaney's comments about a quid pro quo?

JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN, R-UT: Well, I wish there was video to show of what was going on in these so-called impeachment hearings because they haven't been open and transparent. I think what Adam Schiff did when he lied, he physically lied in front of the committee when he had a chance to go and talk about that, I don't think they're laying a glove on Donald Trump.

Inside the beltway, there's a frenzy. Out in the heartland, in the Dallas, Texases of the world, it's not moving the meter at all.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Harman, how strong is the case that's being built against the president?

JANE HARMAN, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-CALIF.: Well, I'm not in the room either, but to be clear, these are depositions, they're not hearings. There are various people were talking under oath. Republicans and Democrats are in the room. The questions are primarily being asked by counsel. But Republicans and Democrats had equal time to ask questions.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: OK. But enough about the process, what do you think of the substance?

HARMAN: So, you know, the substance leaks out, and it's in the press, but I think it hasn't been a good week for the president.

Two good things happened. One is, I think sort of kind of good week, he backed off on the China tariffs. That's a big deal because the economy was about to -- it seems to me soft into a point that it really hurt him. But the other sort of kind of big deal is our troops are moving to Iraq, they are not leaving the area. So, there will be some counter-ISIS movement.

That does not mean I think his Syria decision made any sense. I don't think so. I agree with Mitch McConnell.

WALLACE: Maybe the biggest surprise in my interview with Mick Mulvaney is he doesn't seem to have known about the revelations this week about Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden finally answered questions about his business dealings in Ukraine. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

INTERVIEWER: If your last name wasn't Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?

HUNTER BIDEN, SON OF JOE BIDEN: I don't know, I don't know. Probably not. I don't think that there's a lot of things that wouldn't have happened in my life that if my last name wasn't Biden.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But, Kim, we also learned that one of those State Department officials who testified before the House impeachment investigation this week was so disturbed in 2015 when Hunter Biden started working for this Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, and that -- at least the appearance if nothing else, at least the appearance that it seemed to be self-dealing, that he went to the vice president himself, because Biden, of course, was then Vice President, and said this really looks bad and he was turned away.

How big a deal?

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Yes, I mean, I think it is a big deal. It surprised no one though because prior to the press deciding that this was a whole issue that we're not allowed to talk about, Joe Biden did nothing wrong, they were writing all the stories about this, and quoting former officials who worked for Joe Biden saying they were uneasy with the situation. And they didn't like that it was happening.

And so -- I mean, the issue here to me has always been -- people like to use the word ""corrupt"", the issue was always been the appearance question, right? It's the question of whether or not Hunter Biden was profiting off of his father's position. You don't really need to go much further than that.

And it is hurting Joe Biden out there with primary voters.

WALLACE: Let's pick up on that one because the president who doesn't like the back down did back down overnight and say, well, OK, I'm not going to hold the summit next June, the G7 summit in Doral, his own resort -- there was really a lot of squealing about it from Republicans and Democrats who said it appeared to be this kind of self-dealing, do you think one of the reasons that he may have done it is because it would certainly -- it seemed to blunt his case against Joe Biden?

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it did. I think the cancellation is a tiny step in the right direction. But again, this is so blatant and over-the-top self-dealing on the part of the president, putting his self interest, or as Mick Mulvaney said to you, his history as a man in the hospitality business, about the national interest. I think that then speaks to behold Ukrainian deal.

But on a larger point, I think it's one of the campaign promises that he broke. He said he was going to divest himself of all business interests. So this cancellation is a step in the right direction, but think for a second about the idea that he has no problem appointing Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, as some kind of emissary to the Middle East and he's dealing with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, a man who's killed journalists and making excuses. I think this is -- again, this is this is not normal.

WALLACE: That's just a decision, and as Mick Mulvaney said about Rudy Giuliani, the president gets to decide who he wants to do his business. That's just the policy issue.

WILLIAMS: I think that -- again, you're putting your family in positions of critical policy. So, it's apart from the normal operation of foreign policy in the country. It's like the shadow foreign policy that was run by Giuliani.

But again, to my mind, you look at Doral -- the reason I say it's part of a pattern, Chris, is Doral was a struggling property, here is the president saying, here, I'm going to help my own business and forever branded as the prestigious pot because of the G7 was held there.

WALLACE: Kim?

STRASSEL: Well, look, this is a very complicated subject. I'm glad that he decided not to do it because I do think it blunts his message about the appearance of conflict with Hunter Biden. There is a very complicated discussion to be had about whether or not Donald Trump's business empire has actually profited from his business (ph) or more likely, as much of the reporting has shown, he's probably taken a hit. I mean, there's good evidence that his bookings are down out a lot of his places and some --

WALLACE: Nobody made him run for president.

STRASSEL: No, no, I'm not saying -- I mean, I'm just saying I'm not like arguing, oh, poor president. I'm just saying, look at the numbers. You can't just run around and say, oh, you know, the president is profiting off of his presidency, like I think you just have to look at the facts. Yes.

WALLACE: But, Kim, it's about profit.

STRASSEL: Look at the facts.

WALLACE: The emoluments clause says you can't take any compensation from a foreign government.

STRASSEL: Well, we have never had a discussion in the court system about what the emoluments clause actually (INAUDIBLE).

WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying, that's what it says.

WALLACE: Well, there are actually a few court cases right now.

HARMAN: We're having it now.

WALLACE: So, we'll see.

All right, we've got to --

STRASSEL: We're going to find out.

WALLACE: Folks, I've got to save time for you for the next panel.

We have to take a break here. Up next, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins us here in Washington after a debate that has some Democrats saying he can compete with Joe Biden as the centrist voice of the party.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Mayor Pete Buttigieg hot off the debate stage, where he went toe to toe with his Democratic rivals.

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-IND., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask him, what's his path to the nomination.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Pete Buttigieg is trying to get back into the top tier of 2020 Democratic candidates. And a strong performance in this week's debate paid off with more than $1 million in campaign contributions in the first 24 hours after the debate.

Joining us now is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

And, Mayor, welcome back.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: Let's start with your latest poll numbers. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys, you're in fourth place nationally at 5.8 percent, fourth in Iowa with 13 percent, and fourth in New Hampshire at 8.7 percent. As a candidate from the Midwest, and also looking at those numbers, don't you have to finish in the top at least two or three in Iowa or you're done?

BUTTIGIEG: I think it's certainly the case that a strong performance in Iowa is going to be critical to us winning the nomination. And that's what we're building toward. We've got a terrific ground game there, over 22, I believe, field offices now and 100 organizers, and I think a message that's really connecting with Iowans. You know, Democrats there, first and foremost, of course, want to know that we can defeat and replace President Trump. Also want to know how the policies we're putting forward are going to affect their lives. And whether it's Medicare for all who want it or the vision we're putting forward on any of a number of issues, we find that it's resonating.

But even now there are so many Iowans who maybe have it narrowed down to a top three or so but are taking their time, evaluating their choices. And we've got our work cut out for us to close the deal between now and the caucus.

WALLACE: You have stalled to some degree in the polls, as we just pointed out, at least nationally, ever since that terrible police shooting in South Bend, Indiana, this summer. And folks noticed a more aggressive performance by you in this last debate, taking on Elizabeth Warren on Medicare for all, Tulsi Gabbard on troops in Syria, and Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks.

Take a look at you.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BUTTIGIEG: Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. Respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong.

I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Was that a conscious effort to jumpstart your campaign?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, these are also topics I'm very passionate about. When it comes to what is being done to not just the Middle East, for example, but to American credibility. The fact that right now people who put their lives on the line, trusting that the United States would have their back, and are now betrayed, the fact that U.S. troops in the field feel that their honor has been stolen from them by their commander in chief, how can you not be fired up about something like that? And this is the season for us to lay out what we care about, what we're passionate about, and what's different among each of the candidates. And I want to make sure there's no question in any voter's mind how their life would be different under my presidency than if any of the others were to be elected.

WALLACE: Well, one of the distinctions you drew sharply is you said that 2021, if a Democrat is elected president, the -- the country can make historic gains on health care and immigration and guns, but not, you said, if they push too far and promise too much.

Do you think that some of the solutions that are being offered, whether it's on climate change, Medicare for all, by Senators Warren and Sanders, are too drastic?

BUTTIGIEG: I think that we have a chance to build an American majority around bold action. But it is the case that we could wreck that majority through purity tests. Look, take the example of this Medicare question. I'm proposing Medicare for all who want it. It means we create a version of Medicare, everybody can get access to it, and if you get -- if you want to keep your private plan, we're OK with that. I think that's a better policy than kicking people off of their plan.

But I also think that it's something that more Americans can get behind. And when you think about the condition our country's going to be in when this presidency comes to an end, one way or the other, when you think about how torn apart by politics we're going to be, how polarized and divided this country is, this, to me, is not a political question, it's a question of governing. The good news is, we can govern in a very bold and forward-leading direction, but we've got to make sure we do it in a way that moves toward unifying rather than further polarizing the American people.

WALLACE: Not surprisingly, the left is firing back at you when Elizabeth Warren said that she will not participate in big fundraisers, even if she is the Democratic nominee against Donald Trump in -- next fall. You said this, let's put it on the screen, we are not going to beat him -- Trump -- with pocket change. Here's how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded. Small dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttigieg insults here as pocket change, out fundraised him by millions. Our nation's leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it.

So, what do you have to say to AOC?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, you don't go from mayor of South Bend to a competitive presidential candidate without knowing a thing or two about grassroots campaigning. My campaign is fueled by the contributions of almost 600,000 individual donors. And most of those are small contributions. What I'm saying is that we can't go into this fight against Donald Trump with one hand tied behind our back.

Look, the president of the United States and his allies just raised $125 million. They will pull out all of the stops to stay in power. And I think we have a responsibility to the country to make sure that we go into this fight, as Democrats, with everything that we've got, and not unilaterally disarming.

We indeed need to end the era of big money politics. That's why campaign finance reform is so important. And it will never happen as long as the folks currently in charge stay there.

WALLACE: The last time you and I talked was in August and I pointed out to you -- perhaps not too charitably -- that you were at zero percent in the polls among African-Americans. There's a new poll out in the last few days. You're now at two percent support among African-Americans.

When we last talked, you -- you -- you described a big outreach to minority communities, the African-American community. Why isn't it working?

BUTTIGIEG: Look, for me this isn't about the polls, this is about making sure that –

WALLACE: Well, in the end, it is about the polls.

BUTTIGIEG: But in order to do well, you need to deserve to do well. And we're focusing on the substance of what I have to offer. Voters want to know how their lives will be different. And in the case of African-American voters, they want to know what my agenda is for black Americans.

We're putting forward the most comprehensive plan of any candidate to tackle systemic racism in this country. It's everything from empowering black entrepreneurs and fueling business development, to making sure we deal with discrimination in housing and in health, to cutting incarceration in this country by 50 percent because we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately harms African-Americans. We need to continue making that case. It's extremely well-received whenever I have a chance to offer it up, but there are a lot of voters who are still sizing up their options, who need to feel like they know you. And our job is to do that in a short amount of time.

WALLACE: I want to press down on this just a little bit because you talk about needing to deserve it and voters trying to understand who you are.

You were supposed to attend a big fundraiser in Chicago on Friday. And one of the hosts was the same city attorney who worked very hard to block release of this video of police shooting Laquan McDonald. The lawyer backed out of -- of the fundraiser. He also donated $5,600 to your campaign. Particularly at a time when African-Americans are trying to get to know you, isn't that the kind of mistake, Mayor, that you can't afford to make?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, this came to my attention in the morning and within an hour it had been taken care of. Look, the situation there and justice and transparency for Laquan McDonald is much more important to me than a campaign contribution. And we did the right thing as soon as it came to my attention.

WALLACE: Can you understand where people would say, well, this is a guy who wants our vote but he was going to take -- was taking money, and was attending a fundraiser being held by this city attorney?

BUTTIGIEG: And then we took care of it.

Look, I think the biggest question on voter's minds is, how is my life going to be different, especially when that sun comes up, that first day after Donald Trump is president. And the agenda that I'm putting forward, the -- the issues that I want to tackle, I think will speak to black voters and to all voters who are seeking a better life in this country and seeking to turn the page from the chaos and the corruption that we're living under right now.

WALLACE: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you. Safe travels on the campaign trail, sir.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: When we come back, Turkey agrees to a temporary ceasefire in Syria. We'll ask our Sunday group what it means for U.S. interests in the Middle East.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The Kurds are very happy./ Turkey is very happy. The United States is very happy. And, you know what, civilization is very happy. It's a great thing for civilization.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump with an optimistic assessment of the cease-fire brokered by Vice President Pence this week in Turkey.

And we're back now with the panel.

Congresswoman Harman, what you think of the deal that the U.S. made with Turkey?

HARMAN: I think, sadly, Pence and his advisors were scrambling on the plane to come up with some kind of announcement that would make sense. And I salute Pence for trying. However, I don't think he succeeded. I think a deal under these circumstances was impossible. And where we are now is the ceasefire is not holding, the Kurds, our allies, who lost 11,000 people on the battlefield, we lost six, are being massacred. There is now a vacuum being filled by ISIS, by Syria, the Syrian government, and by Russia.

And, guess what, Israel, our -- our deepest ally in the region, is now surrounded by Iran on the Syrian border, by Iran making the missiles from Libya -- from Lebanon smarter on the Lebanese border and by Iran and Tehran. And this is creating an existential threat and leading to really dangerous circumstances.

And, finally, ISIS is regrouping and the ISIS fighters that are regrouping are from Europe and they will get through the Turkish border and attack in Europe.

WALLACE: Congressman Chaffetz, even a lot of staunch Trump supporter's inside the Republican Party have real problems with the agreement and -- and the actions by the president in northern Syria.

Your thoughts?

JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: I think the agreement was good, although temporary. We'll see how it stands above and beyond the last few days.

But the president did the right thing. He did exactly what he was campaigning on doing. I believe if you -- if you can't go and fight and win the war, then you bring them home. And, you know what, if the Senate and the House feel so strongly, then pass a piece of legislation. Don't just do some little slap on the hand and right an op-ed and say, oh, tisk, tisk, Mr. President.

WALLACE: You -- you're talking about Mitch McConnell?

CHAFFETZ: Yes. I'm saying that they should actually pass a war powers authorization and do that. Put on your big boy pants and do that.

But the president's doing the right thing.

WALLACE: And then there was the meeting on Syria that was held at the White House this week. Here's the indelible picture of it. It ended with President Trump calling Speaker Pelosi, depending on the account you heard, either a third rate or a third grade politician, not a complement in either case, and Pelosi getting up, as you see here, and walking out.

Here's what they said afterwards.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: That crazy Nancy. She is crazy.

PELOSI: I pray for the president all the time, and I tell them that. I pray for his safety and that of his family. The -- now we have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Juan, not only can't they legislate in Congress anymore, they've apparently can't even stand to be in each other's presence.

WILLIAMS: No, I mean, it's -- to me what's key here is that I think you see from the House vote that even Republicans were shocked out of their silence in -- in responding to President Trump by his decision.

WALLACE: You think you'd vote against the president's Syria policy?

WILLIAMS: I think you said it earlier, 129 Republicans voted with the Democratic majority. So it clearly showed there is bipartisan outrage at allowing our allies, the Kurds, to be slaughtered by the Turks in this way.

With response -- in response to your question about the meeting, I think that Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, speaker of the House, the minority leader in the Senate, were strong enough to confront the president in the meeting, to get in his face and say, this is the wrong policy. And the president responded with elementary school, you know, schoolyard bullying, third rate politician. Nancy Pelosi is no third rate politician by anybody's measure.

But I think the key here is the policy, Chris, the policy is the problem. And to be clear, and I think this is in response that Congressman Chaffetz point, this is not about bringing troops home. There are only about 150 troops involved. The president just sent 2,000 to Saudi Arabia. So, I mean, to me, this is about the president pulling our influence out of there, allowing our allies to be slaughtered, and compromising America's integrity and promise to our allies. It's a foreign policy quagmire.

WALLACE: Kim, I wanted you to address a different aspect of that, which is that both sides talk about being able to walk and chew gum at the same time, trying to get some things done. The one thing they particularly talk about is passing the USMCA, the U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Can they get anything done between the impeachment investigation, the bitterness from that, and the fact that we're -- you could say we're all already in a full-fledged campaign. Certainly by the end of the year we're in a full-fledged campaign.

STRASSEL: Right. I mean whatever happened in that meeting and the dueling narratives, it almost doesn't matter because what it exposes is what you just said, is that when Democrats decided they were going to go forward with this impeachment inquiry, it created a new dynamic in Washington. And this is one of the consequences of it.

I do not see how anyone gets anything done while they're in the middle of - - I mean, think of it from the Trump White House perspective. They're trying to remove him from office. And that just does make it a very difficult circumstance in which he -- then sit down, shake hands, play nice.

I agree, everyone would want there to be progress and I think that the best thing the Trump White House could do would be, to fact, to kind of rise above it and talk about governing and talk about what they've accomplished and what they want to accomplish. But I'm not quite sure that is going to be the dynamic going forward.

HARMAN: Government funding --

WALLACE: Congresswoman, I've got less than a minute left.

Does impeachment and politics poison everything? Does anything get done in Washington between now and November 2020?

HARMAN: Well, that was the history of the Clinton impeachment, everything stopped. But government funding runs out on November 21st, in the middle of whatever it is that we're going to see. And I think it would be tragic if, once again, we put federal workers and -- and the economy through that nightmare. So the Congress has to pass the budget bills. There has to be progress. And I think the leadership of Congress somehow will find a way forward.

WALLACE: So the most they can do is keep the government running?

HARMAN: Keep the government running. Right.

WALLACE: All right.

Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" trying to solve the 82-year-old mystery, what happened to Amelia Earhart?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: It is one of the enduring mysteries of the 20th and now the 21st century, but a renowned explorer is determined to solve it.

Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERT BALLARD, DEEP-SEA EXPLORER: She said, I can do anything, and then went out and did it.

WALLACE (voice over): Robert Ballard is talking about America Earhart, the world-famous aviator, who's this mysterious disappearance 82 years ago has only added to her legend.

In August, Ballard led an expedition to find some trace of Earhart or her plane. It's the subject of a new ""National Geographic"" documentary.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's shedding new light on one of the world's most captivating people.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In ship number six, it's the world-famous Amelia Earhart.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) is good to go.

BALLARD: It exists. It's not the Loch Ness Monster. It's not Bigfoot. That plane exists, which means you can find it.

WALLACE: Earhart was on an around the world trip in 1937 when her plane vanished in the Pacific.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For years she pushed the boundaries of what was humanly possible, shattering a dozen records in the air, while breaking barriers for women on the ground.

WALLACE: The leading theory is Earhart ran out of gas near a tiny atoll called Nikumaroro. And that's where Ballard took his ship, the Nautilus, spending two weeks searching the coral reef with surface vessels, drones, and remote underwater vehicles.

BALLARD: It's just hours and hours and hours and hours searching at night with a flashlight. You never know.

WALLACE: Thirty-four years ago, Ballard led another expedition and shocked the world by discovering Titanic.

WALLACE (on camera): How does this search compare to searching for and finding Titanic?

BALLARD: This one's tougher. A lot tougher.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard feels a kinship with Earhart. They're both Kansans. But there's more.

BALLARD: I always have people say, you're nuts. You can't do it. And then I go do it.

WALLACE (on camera): And is there some Amelia Earhart in that too?

BALLARD: You bet there's a lot of Amelia Earhart in the sky.

WALLACE (voice over): For two weeks Ballard and his team searched the area, on land in case Earhart survived a crash, and underwater.

BALLARD: Whoa. Whoa, that looks like coral, but it's got a hole.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's got a perfect hole. Want to simple it.

BALLARD: Yes, just flip it over.

We pounded the area. This was a full court press with everything we had.

WALLACE (on camera): And, in the end, what did you find?

BALLARD: We didn't find the plane.

WALLACE: How big a disappointment?

BALLARD: Well, you know, I know where it isn't.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard says that's science. You go down dark alleys, then don't go down them again. Now he plans another expedition in two years using new technology to another site nearby.

BALLARD: I love the toys as much as I -- I love the hunt.

WALLACE (on camera): And you get to do both here.

BALLARD: Absolutely. I love developing the technology, going out and using it, and then coming home and sharing the story.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: The special exhibition, ""Amelia,"" premieres tonight on the National Geographic Channel.

Time now for one final note.

We have declared ourselves the unofficial Sunday show of the Washington Nationals. This week they clinched the National League championship in a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, setting up the National's first trip to the World Series. They'll play the Houston Astros in game one of the series Tuesday night right here on Fox.

And someone is so excited that he showed up here today, Teddy Roosevelt, one of the raising (ph) presidents from Nats park has dropped by and Teddy has delegated me to say, go Nats!

WILLIAMS: Go Nats!

CHAFFETZ: Go Nationals!

WALLACE: Teddy, here you go. Don't hold me hanging.

Oh, my God.

WILLIAMS: Go Teddy!

WALLACE: And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

Opioid distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson all surged in early Wednesday trading after The Wall Street Journal reported the companies are in talks to settle state and local lawsuits blaming them for the US drug epidemic.

AmerisourceBergen and McKesson traded roughly 7% higher early Wednesday. Cardinal Health traded as much as 8% higher.

The three companies are looking to settle the litigation with a collective $18 billion payment over 18 years, sources told WSJ. The settlement would serve as a sweeping resolution to a collection of lawsuits and keep the drugmakers from bankruptcy.

OxyContin producer Purdue Pharma was forced to file for bankruptcy in mid-September to pay a settlement valued between $10 billion and $12 billion.

The news follows Johnson & Johnson settling two Ohio opioid lawsuits for $20.4 million on October 1. The deal allows the pharmaceutical giant to skip an upcoming federal trial looking to hold health care firms accountable for the epidemic.

AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson are all scheduled to join the federal trial in Ohio Monday. The case is set to serve as a critical precedent in other lawsuits against opioid producers and distributors.

Opioids contributed to more than 400,000 overdose fatalities in the US from 1999 to 2017, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2017 alone, with 68% of the fatalities involving prescription or illicit opioids.

* Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders remains hospitalized, but according to his wife, the Vermont senator will not need any additional medical procedures and he expects to participate in the Democratic primary debate scheduled for Oct. 15.

* Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, which is a very impressive haul, and puts her second only to Bernie Sanders’ $25.3 million quarter. [Update: I added this item after originally publishing the round-up.]

* Reinforcing impressions that Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign sees Joe Biden as a threat, the president’s operation is launching a $1 million ad buy in early primary states, airing a new attack ad peddling a discredited conspiracy theory involving the former vice president and Ukraine.

* Speaking of Biden, the Democratic campaign announced yesterday that it raised $12.5 million in the third quarter. It’s an underwhelming haul, which is roughly half the money Sanders raised over the same three-month period.

* For his part, Biden is moving forward with a $6 million ad buy in the first four states holding 2020 nominating contests.

* At an official White House event in Florida yesterday, Trump discussed 2020 campaign strategy, went after Elizabeth Warren with his “Pocahontas” slur, and labeled Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe.” It served as a reminder that the president obviously has no qualms about blurring the lines of propriety ahead of 2020.

* In an increasingly common dynamic in the GOP, former Rep. Pete Sessions (R) is launching a comeback bid in a new congressional district. Sessions lost last year in Texas’ 32nd district – an area he’d represented for more than two decades – so he’s now moving to Texas’ 17th district, which will be home to an open-seat contest next year.

* A new Washington Post-Schar School poll shows Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) with a 47% approval rating, despite his recent racial controversy. The same poll found Trump with a 39% approval rating in the commonwealth.

* And in Ohio, the latest Emerson poll shows Biden narrowly leading Sanders, 29% to 27%, with Warren not far behind with 21%. Also of note, the survey found each of the Democratic contenders leading Trump in Ohio in hypothetical general election match-ups."

* Louisiana will hold its first round of balloting tomorrow in its gubernatorial race, and Donald Trump will visit the state tonight to rally the Republican troops. Incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) is expected to outpace his GOP rivals, and if Edwards tops the 50% threshold tomorrow, there will be no second round of voting next month.

* Speaking of presidential travel, Trump was in Minneapolis last night for an unusually long campaign rally, at which he attacked all kinds of foes, targeting Joe Biden with particular zeal.

* Former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was planning a comeback next year, but now that he appears to be “Congressman-1” in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman – Rudy Giuliani’s associates who were arrested this week – the Texan’s political future is again in doubt.

* On a related note, many of the Republicans who received contributions from Parnas and Fruman are scrambling to either give the money back or donate it to charity.

* While most national Democratic presidential primary polls show Joe Biden’s lead over Elizabeth Warren disappearing, Fox News’ latest national poll shows the former vice president leading the Massachusetts senator, 32% to 22%. Bernie Sanders is third in the poll with 17%. (Also of interest, Beto O’Rourke reached 3% in the Fox poll, which moves him a little closer to qualifying for the party’s November primary debate.)

* As for the general election, Fox’s poll found Biden and Warren leading Trump by 10 points each, while Sanders leads the president in a hypothetical match-up by nine points.

* Forty-five years ago, Rep. Larry Hogan Sr. (R-Md.) was the first Republican on the House Judiciary Committee to vote to impeach Richard Nixon. Yesterday, his son, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan Jr. (R), announced his support for Congress’ impeachment inquiry into Trump.

* And in a bit of a surprise, House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) announced yesterday that she’ll retire at the end of this Congress. Her district, which Hillary Clinton carried by 20 points, is expected to remain in Democratic hands."

* As expected, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) came out on top in the first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, but his 47% wasn’t enough to prevent a runoff. The incumbent will face millionaire novice Eddie Rispone (R), who received 27% support in the multi-candidate contest.

* Donald Trump, who headlined a rally in Louisiana late last week, said he pushed John Bel Edwards’ support from 66% to 47%. There is literally no evidence to support this – pre-election polls were surprisingly accurate – and the president has an unfortunate habit of touting made-up numbers.

* After Facebook refused to take down a Trump campaign ad with demonstrably false claims, Elizabeth Warren launched an ad of her own with deliberately false information – about Facebook.

* On a related note, the social-media giant responded by noting that broadcast stations have aired the same dishonest Trump ad. It opens an interesting door: broadcast stations are regulated by the FCC, while Facebook isn’t regulated by government agency.

* Beto O’Rourke’s campaign announced on Friday afternoon that it raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, which is an improvement on the second quarter. That said, nearly all of the top Democratic contenders had better July-to-September hauls.

* On a related note, O’Rourke said at CNN’s LGBTQ town-hall event last week that he believes houses of worship should probably lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose marriage equality. That’s almost certainly not a legally sound approach.

* Bernie Sanders noted in an ABC News interview, which aired yesterday, that there’s an important difference between his vision and Elizabeth Warren’s. “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones,” the Vermont independent said. “I’m not.”

* And four days after saying she was weighing a boycott of this week’s presidential primary debate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) told supporters this week that she’s decided to participate. Barring any 11th-hour changes, it means 12 candidates will be on the stage tomorrow night."

* The latest national Monmouth poll found Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) leading former Vice President Joe Biden (D) in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, 28% to 25%. Sanders is third with 15%, and no other candidate topped 5% in the poll.

* The same poll found roughly 39% of registered voters believe Donald Trump deserves a second term, while 57% are ready for a new president.

* Much of the Democrats’ 2020 field participated in an MSNBC policy forum yesterday on addressing gun violence. NBC published a live-blog of the event.

* The lineup and podium order for the next Democratic presidential primary debate was announced yesterday, and it will be a one-night, 12-candidate event.

* With only a month remaining ahead of Louisiana’s gubernatorial race, Trump is urging his followers in the state to support either Eddie Rispone (R) or Ralph Abraham (R), one of whom is likely to advance to a probable runoff against incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D).

* Similarly, with time running out in Mississippi’s gubernatorial race, the president is throwing his support behind Tate Reeves’ (R) candidacy, arguing yesterday that his rival, state Attorney General Jim Hood (D), is “pro-Crooked Hillary.” In case anyone’s curious, the 2016 election was 1,058 days ago."

* Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was hospitalized yesterday in Las Vegas and “underwent a significant medical procedure after a blockage was found in one of his arteries.” As NBC News’ report added, “Sanders, who is 78, has canceled all of his campaign events ‘until further notice.’”

* Buoyed by African-American support, Joe Biden leads the Democratic presidential field in South Carolina according to the latest Winthrop University poll. The former vice president has 37% support, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 17%. Bernie Sanders is third with 8%, followed by Kamala Harris at 7%.

* Speaking of the Palmetto State, some South Carolina Republicans, including former Rep. Bob Inglis, sued the state Republican Party this week “over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year.”

* As difficult as this may seem to believe, Andrew Yang, a Democratic presidential candidate running for elected office for the first time, raised $10 million in the third quarter. That’s “more than triple the $2.8 million Yang raised in the second quarter.”

* Kamala Harris, meanwhile, raised $11.6 million between July and September, which is awfully close to the $11.8 million she raised in the second quarter.

* Former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), whose 2020 presidential campaign has struggled to gain traction, has reportedly lost four key aides, including his state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire.

* Joe Biden’s campaign released a new plan on gun policy today, which includes an assault-weapons ban. Under the blueprint, those Americans who already own assault weapons would be required to either register the weapons or sell them to the government.

* Speaking of new 2020 plans, Elizabeth Warren’s campaign unveiled a new proposal this morning that would tax lobbying: “Under her proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35% tax on their expenditures. The rate would increase to 60% for spending of more than $1 million, and to 75% above $5 million.”

* And finally, Donald Trump last week told a rather detailed story about CNN building a multi-million-dollar studio in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district, which he said the network intended to keep up “for weeks” if the Democratic candidate won in a recent special election. Like so many of the president’s bizarre anecdotes, the story was completely made up and had no basis in reality."

Bernie Sanders – the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist whose standing in the 2020 primary has become threatened by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren – is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a “capitalist.”,2019-10-14,Fox News,Bernie Sanders slams Elizabeth Warren as ‘capitalist’,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dividing-lines-bernie-sanders-slams-elizabeth-warren-as-capitalist,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist whose standing in the 2020 primary has become threatened by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s surge in the Democratic primary with progressive voters – is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a “capitalist.”

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS’ PLAN: ECONOMISTS

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ""I am a capitalist to my bones.""

Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ""will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

A Gallup poll this year found that 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, while 51 percent say it would be a bad thing. Gallup noted that in 1942, a Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing while only 25 percent called it a good thing.

The polling is fresh evidence that attitudes toward socialism are changing, amid the popularity in the Democratic Party of Democratic socialists like Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pushes policies like “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal.

Meanwhile, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, claim that billionaires could face a 97.5 percent average effective tax rate under Sanders' plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020.

Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told Bloomberg that “with the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes."" The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan.

The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent for fortunes in excess of $10 billion.

Sanders vowed to go further than Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires’ fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren.

Sanders’ plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders’ tax rates don’t top out until 8 percent for the richest households.

On the roster: Welcome to the Thunderdome, Elizabeth Warren - Pelosi still not biting on impeachment vote - Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Bevin recovers in Kentucky poll - Sláinte, Mr. Bradley



WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME, ELIZABETH WARREN

WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose steady stream of plans have propelled her to the top of the Democratic presidential field, came under sustained attack for the first time during a raucous primary debate here Tuesday that revealed Democrats’ ongoing public struggle to define their beliefs and choose a standard-bearer to take on President Trump. Warren (Mass.) faced direct challenges from several of the 11 other candidates onstage, who took her on over her policies, her fitness to serve as commander in chief and her willingness to question the motives of Democrats who support less transformational ideas. … The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday’s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. Former vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing… Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble.”



Klobuchar, Buttigieg shone through - National Review: “The October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise, in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up, smelled the coffee, and brought their A-games: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls, this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate. But in a way-too-long, often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment, Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out.”



Sanders and Warren have deep pockets as Biden burns cash - AP: “Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don’t just lead the Democratic presidential primary in fundraising. They’ve stockpiled millions more than their rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who burned through money at a fast clip over the past three months while posting an anemic fundraising haul. Sanders held $33.7 million cash on hand on his third-quarter fundraising report. Warren had $25.7 million during the same period, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg came next $23.3 million. Biden, meanwhile, held just $8.9 million, a small fraction of what his leading rivals have at their disposal. With the first votes of the Democratic contest just months away, the candidates are entering a critical and expensive period when having an ample supply of cash can make or break a campaign. Biden’s total raises questions about his durability as a front-runner.”



Squad to endorse Sanders - Fox News: “Three members of the so-called ‘Squad’ of far-left freshman members of Congress are lining up behind Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a ‘Bernie’s Back’ rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed. In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. … The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren…”



Steyer spending stupendous - WSJ: “Billionaire Tom Steyer appeared on the Democratic presidential debate stage for the first time Tuesday night, but voters in early states have already seen him on TV thousands of times. Mr. Steyer, who new federal filings show has poured nearly $48 million of his own money into his long-shot bid, is dominating television screens in the first four states that will hold nominating contests early next year. Since entering the race in July, Mr. Steyer has spent more than $26 million on TV ads, airing more than 53,000 spots in markets that reach Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. All told, that is more than six times as many as the rest of the Democratic field combined.”



THE RULEBOOK: DEMOCRACY AND CHILL

“Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 21



TIME OUT: AN INVENTOR’S SLAP SHOT

Smithsonian: “Invented by Frank Zamboni, the eponymous ice-clearing machine celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. He applied for his first U.S. patent in 1949, for this innovative idea that totally transformed winter sports by giving chopped-up ice surfaces a fresh-frozen smoothness in a matter of minutes. ‘At the time, he was just trying to address a need of his,’ says Frank Zamboni, the inventor’s grandson and now president of the Zamboni Company. ‘He saw a need for the ice rink he owned with his brother and cousins… Instead of taking 1 1/2 hours to clean the ice, that was time somebody could be paying to skate on it.’ Contrary to popular belief, the Zamboni machine was not invented in Canada—the place of snow and ice—but in Southern California—the land of sun and fun. … As time went on, he saw a need to quickly clean the ice, so he started improvising with war-surplus equipment.”

PELOSI STILL NOT BITING ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders will hold off on a full House vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be ‘reassessed at some point.’ The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. Trump, White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. But Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son — potentially at the risk of losing U.S. military aid.”



Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Gallup: “Public opinion on whether Trump should be impeached remains mixed, but Americans now lean slightly more in favor of impeachment and removal from office compared with where they stood in June. Currently, 52% say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46% say he should not be. This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller's investigation.”



Staffers fear White House seeking scapegoat on Ukraine call - NYT: “President Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it. Even as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials’ actions around Mr. Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower’s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power. The lawyers’ inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.”



Mulvaney emerges as key figure in impeachment probe - WaPo: “In late May, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting that stripped control of the country’s relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department. Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kiev to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump. The work of those ‘three amigos,’ as they came to call themselves — diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary Rick Perry — has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing before an impeachment inquiry in Congress.”



BEVIN RECOVERS IN KENTUCKY POLL

WYMT: “The Mason-Dixon Kentucky Poll was released early Wednesday morning, and the results are interesting. The poll shows that statewide, 46 percent of likely voters support Republican Governor Matt Bevin, while 46 percent back Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48 percent-40 percent lead over Bevin, but the incumbent has pulled into a tie with his challenger. One percent of respondents voted for Libertarian nominee John Hicks, while seven percent were undecided. The poll also shows Bevin's GOP support grew from 67 percent in December to 77 percent. He is pulling in 22 percent of Democrat respondents for the cross-over vote, while Beshear is drawing 15 percent from Republicans. Among the Mason-Dixon poll participants, Bevin led among men, older voters and rural voters. … The poll credits some of Bevin's resurgence to President Donald Trump's popularity in Kentucky and resistance to his impeachment.”



Second debate was heavy with personal attacks - Louisville Courier Journal: “Republican incumbent Matt Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear had their ugliest public exchange Tuesday at the second gubernatorial debate of the fall campaign. Throughout the discussion, hosted before a raucous crowd of supporters on the University of Kentucky campus, the two rivals called each other liars and regularly interrupted one another as they were peppered with policy questions. When moderators asked about ways they would encourage students to pursue a career in public education, including the state's colleges and universities, the conversation took a turn into the gutter. … The high stakes debate touched on health care, pension reform, medical marijuana and supporting out-of-work coal miners. But it underscored how Kentucky's race for governor this year is defined by Bevin and Beshear's enmity as much as their deep differences on tackling the state's woes.”

AUDIBLE: THANKS?

“[Amy Klobuchar] had some smart answers. I’m starting not to care that she is brutal to her staff.” – Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, writing in Politico about the Democrats’ debate.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If Trump is impeached and the Senate is mad at him, votes him out, then the GOP could have a primary too. That would take up a lot of news from the Democrats. I think we need a law for 6 months of elections, period.” – Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.



[Ed. note: It would be a comfort to have such constraints, it’s true. But our Constitution just wouldn’t allow for it. The government can’t tell people when they can talk about issues, therefore there’s no way to keep candidates from campaigning and reporters from reporting. I’m increasingly in favor, though, of doing away with primary elections. Our 40-year experiment with them has been a miserable bust and has unnecessarily prolonged our election calendars. Bring back conventions and spare the American people!]



“I have pretty much come to the opinion that two things will happen…one, the 2020 election is not going to be over on election night (owing to huge court battles to follow many very close races) and…two, at some point our Agitator-in-Chief is going to leave office of his own volition…having become tired of the battle and wanting to go back to his business dealings and such. What say youse (that’s a Michigan (born & raised there) UP term)?” – Rick Randell, Bradenton, Fla.



[Ed. note: I say that I know better not to say, Mr. Randell! I think there are lots of potential scenarios for 2020 that could still be in the offing. We may yet see a landslide or even, dare I say, a political realignment. As for Trump leaving early, it’s pretty hard for me to fathom. I doubt he’d give his enemies the pleasure.]



“I miss Chris’ input during events like the debates on Twitter. I understand why he left, and it is best for his happiness. But there were so many Whhhooo Doogie moments last night, I would have loved watching it with him. But since I have found Fox Nation I can see his more candid takes on the events of the day. I just cannot interact with my clever comments! I would love to have him join The Dispatch so he could participate in the discussion groups. I will send them a note to suggest his inclusion! Thank you for being so glorious. (Sorry about the Cardinals, but Charles is happy!)” – Polly Barrett, Waco, Texas

SLÁINTE, MR. BRADLEY

HuffPo: “A man in Dublin, Ireland, decided to inject a little humor into his funeral Saturday by playing a prank on his loved ones. Shay Bradley, a Defense Forces veteran who died Oct. 8 ‘after a long illness bravely borne’ according to his obituary, shocked then delighted funeralgoers when they suddenly heard his voice shouting from his coffin as it was being lowered into the ground. ‘Hello? Hello. Hello? Let me out!’ stunned attendees heard in a prerecorded message that also included ‘knocking’ against the coffin’s lid. … Those at the funeral can be seen giggling and wiping away tears as Bradley’s voice begins to sing: ‘Hello again, hello. Hello, I just called to say goodbye.’ His daughter Andrea Bradley told HuffPost that her father recorded the audio about a year ago — and that no one really knew about it other than her brother Jonathan and her nephew, Ben. Two days before Shay Bradley’s funeral, Jonathan Bradley decided to tell his mom and the rest of his siblings about the prank. He told them that playing the audio at the funeral was his dad’s dying wish.”

""Over the past two weeks, senior campaign leadership received multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior by Rich McDaniel,"" Warren campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman told Fox News. ""Over the same time period, the campaign retained outside counsel to conduct an investigation.""

McDaniel served as the campaign's national organizing director.

""Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,"" Orthman said.

Details of the ""inappropriate behavior"" were not immediately available, but a source told Politico there were no reports of sexual assault.

McDaniel released a statement saying he'd ""separated"" from the campaign, according to Politico.

""I would never intentionally engage in any behavior inconsistent with the campaign or my own values. If others feel that I have, I understand it is important to listen even when you disagree.

McDaniel is a veteran of Democratic campaigns, having previously worked as the field and political director for Sen. Doug Jones' successful bid for the U.S. Senate in a 2017 special election. During the 2016 campaign, McDaniel worked as Hillary Clinton's primary-states regional director in the 2016 campaign and was political director for the Democratic Party of Georgia during the first half of 2015.

The star of HBO's ""Ballers"" tweeted Saturday night and acknowledged that his bond with Warren is ""such a wild and pleasant one.""

""No surprise however, as my character & show transcends politics. Drive, ambition, getting knocked down, getting back up and moving on,"" Johnson said, adding: ""She’s a baller 😉""

Warren is not shy about her love of the show and its main character, retired NFL player-turned financial adviser-turned team owner Spencer Strasmore, played by Johnson. The senator from Massachusetts gushed about the program in an interview with Entertainment Weekly published Friday.

""Why would people be surprised that I like Ballers? It’s got The Rock! What’s not to love?"" Warren told EW.

In an early scene from season five, which is to be the series' last, Johnson's character is seen on the beach reading Warren's book, ""This Fight Is Our Fight.""

""I loved it! I laughed out loud,"" Warren said. ""I thought it was fabulous and I hope he got to finish the book."" She added that the scene was ""very meta.""

The candidates don't seem to be competing to see who can run the country most efficiently. That's the old style of politics.

Instead, these candidates are pledging to remake America entirely. Rip out the old, which is. they're telling us, irredeemably tainted by racism, sexism and free enterprise, and replace it with something completely new and different.

At the heart of this effort is the promise of ""Medicare-for-all."" Now, you may have heard the phrase. Two of the most popular Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both have endorsed it. But what exactly does it mean? What exactly is ""Medicare-for-all""?

SANDERS ACCUSES BIDEN OF PUSHING INSURANCE INDUSTRY 'TALKING POINTS' BY SLAMMING 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

It's worth finding out. It's not a tweak to some regulation. It's not even ObamaCare, which once upon a time Democrats defended and Republicans denounced as socialism.

""Medicare-for-all"" is actual socialism, for-real socialism. Health care spending amounts to about a fifth of the entire American economy. Elizabeth Warren demands total control of all of it -- immediately. That's ""Medicare-for-all."" If it becomes law, it would amount to the largest expansion of the federal government since the second World War -- by far.

So it's worth asking how exactly all of this would work and critically, who would pay for it. Elizabeth Warren has been asked that question many times, and every time, she has refused to answer.

Marc Lacey, national editor for The New York Times: Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: The costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. Hard-working, middle-class families are going to see their costs go down.

Stephen Colbert, host of ""The Late Show"": But will their taxes go up?

Warren: Well -- but here's the thing ...

Colbert: But here's the thing, I've listened to these answers a few times before --

George Stephanopoulos, ABC News host: Will middle-class taxes go up? Will private insurance be eliminated?

Warren: Look, what families have to deal with is cost -- total cost. That's what they have to deal with.

Warren: It's how much are your costs going to go down ...

Chris Matthews, host of ""Hardball"": No, no. Different question. How much of your taxes go up?

Warren: No, it's how much your cost --

Matthews: How is it a different question?

Warren: It is how much families end up spending.

Matthews: I know that argument, but will you pay more in taxes? Why don't you want to answer that question because as Jake said tonight, that's a Republican talking point. It's not a Republican talking point. It's a question.

Warren: It's a question about where people are going to come out economically.

Matthews: That's not my question.

Warren: I spent --

She will not answer. She won't explain, no matter how hard she has been pressed. And as you just saw, even some fairly strident Democratic partisans have pressed her.

Warren refuses. She will not explain what it would cost or who would pay for it.

Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional, or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren anymore.

Well, now we have a credible estimate. According to a study by the Urban Institute, in just the first 10 years, Elizabeth Warren's ""Medicare-for-all"" plan would cost an additional $34 trillion.

That sounds like a lot. How much is it? Here's some perspective.

The Congressional Budget Office anticipates that the United States -- the whole United States -- will collect just $46 trillion in taxes over the same period. In other words, Elizabeth Warren's health care plan alone will consume the overwhelming majority of all tax dollars in the United States.

That's before we spend a single dollar on -- I don't know -- Social Security, education, national defense and everything else.

It's demented.

Now, you should know that the Urban Institute has no motive to attack Elizabeth Warren. It's not a right-wing think tank. It's a left-wing think tank. They likely didn't even account for the cost of one's pledge to give free health care to every illegal alien who sneaks into the country.

So who is going to pay for all of this? Well, think of it this way: $3.4 trillion a year -- that's the estimated cost. Divide that by 320 million Americans, and you get more than $10,000 per person -- not per taxpayer, per person. That means every child, every retiree, every prison inmate, everybody.

That would be the largest tax assessed in American history by far. Nothing even comes close. That would change everything. An awful lot of people would just leave the country and not come back.

So how do you pay for ""Medicare-for-all""? It's not a minor detail we can settle later. It's the single most important question about the program. Why do you think we don't have it already? Because we can't afford it.

Elizabeth Warren pretends that's irrelevant -- and to her, maybe it is irrelevant.

At some point in the last couple of years, Warren stopped functioning as a conventional senator and became a kind of Messianic figure. Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren any more.

Warren has seen the future, and in that future, she has complete and unquestioned control of America. She is the most powerful person in the world.

You can almost hear her repeating the phrase to herself... ""The most powerful person in the world.""

It's intoxicating, clearly.

FACEBOOK CEO ZUCKERBERG MEETS WITH TRUMP, KEY SENATORS ON DC SWING

On Tuesday, leaked audio comments from Zuckerberg said the company would likely sue the U.S. government if Warren became president and attempted to break up the company.

""You have someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,"" Zuckerberg was quoted as saying in two Q&A sessions with Facebook employees during July.

""And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.

This was good news, you see, because it shows she’s the real front-runner. Forget that Biden guy.

“Warren’s Charmed Campaign Just Entered a Brutal New Phase,” warns Politico.

Except, well, it wasn’t really that brutal. The disagreements at Tuesday’s CNN/New York Times debate were relatively civil policy spats. No one went after her character.

BIDEN DEFLECTS QUESTIONS ON SON AS CNN ANCHOR HITS TRUMP'S 'FALSE ACCUSATIONS'

What’s more, the candidates challenging Warren are also-rans, mired in the single digits. So that lessens the impact of those exchanges.

Two of them had very good nights. Amy Klobuchar, shedding her Minnesota Nice approach, repeatedly challenged Warren, the first to point out that her Medicare for All plan would boot 150 million Americans off private insurance. I don’t know why the moderators don’t stress that, because Warren is outplaying them in one debate after another.

Marc Lacey of the Times tried three separate times to get Warren to concede what Bernie Sanders already has, that middle-class taxes would rise under her plan. And three times Warren deflected the question by saying the rich and big corporations would pay more for health care and the middle class would pay less, evading the tax question entirely.

It took Pete Buttigieg to call out Warren for failing to answer a simple yes-or-no question. He had perhaps his best debate of the campaign, making an eloquent pitch for moderate ideas. And his strongest moment came in an exchange on Beto O’Rourke’s gun buyback program, when he said: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.” Buttigieg, of course, is an Afghanistan war veteran.

On the other hand, he only whacked Beto, who’s going nowhere fast.

Politico’s lead story says: “The candidate who brags about having a plan for everything was pilloried for not detailing how she would pay for her most expensive proposal. She was accused — sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly — of being naive, dishonest, not adequately respecting her colleagues’ ideas, tearing people down, and failing to enact major legislation. She was attacked for believing in policies that were “punitive” and a theory of governing that was a ‘pipe dream.’”

The debate just wasn’t as rough as that lead made it sound. After all, they ended by talking about Ellen.

The Washington Post declared Warren one of its winners:

“For the first time in one of these debates, Warren found herself under sustained attack. Through a combination of debate format, Joe Biden’s leads in early polls and Warren’s unique political Teflon, she had somehow avoided it. That changed Tuesday, though. Warren was the focal point, with the other candidates all but taking their focus thoroughly off Biden. It wasn’t completely smooth sailing for Warren…but it was an affirmation that she is viewed as perhaps the front-runner now.”

Look, the reason Warren has had such a smooth ride—besides running a very good, issues-based campaign—is that the press pretty much loves her. I’ve lost track of the number of puffy profiles about how she found her voice in Oklahoma, at Harvard, as a bankruptcy lawyer, at the consumer protection agency. She is getting one-hundredth of the media scrutiny that’s been aimed at Biden, who is not a press favorite.

When that changes, you’ll know she’s the front-runner.

As for Biden, he had some strong moments, especially on Syria, but his answers about his son were weak—especially since Hunter Biden confessed to poor judgment on ABC that morning even as his dad was touting his judgment that night. Biden caught a break when Anderson Cooper followed up only once and none of the other Democrats wanted to go there.

The media consensus is that Biden had another uneven night, and he does have a tendency to trip over his words. And yet, despite poor debate reviews and having to play defense on Ukraine, he keeps holding onto his supporters.

The bottom line is that the impeachment drama will quickly drown out this debate, whose 8.3 million viewers represent another decline. There won’t be days of stories about Klobuchar or Buttigieg that might ordinarily give them a chance to break through. If either is to have a shot at becoming Warren’s main moderate rival, the Biden campaign will essentially have to collapse.

Sanders took a break from the trail this week after he ended up in the hospital with heart complications and underwent an emergency procedure Tuesday to repair a blocked artery, according to his campaign.

""We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,"" Sanders' campaign said in a statement.

Varney argued that Sanders' hospital visit lends credence to those questioning whether his age will get in the way of securing a spot in the Oval Office.

""There are now obvious questions about whether a 78-year-old can endure months of exhausting campaigning,"" he said.

Varney then turned to Biden, who has come under fire since the launch of a formal impeachment investigation against President Trump over the content of a phone call during which Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Biden and son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

""He is a casualty of the impeachment, he is collateral damage,"" said Varney. ""All the attention given to the Ukraine call has brought back the question about Hunter Biden, and the money he received in Ukraine and China.""

""It all happened so quickly,"" he continued, ""but as of now, it's Elizabeth Warren's nomination to lose.""

However, Varney said he didn't think Warren could win the general election in November 2020 ""for two reasons.""

""I don't think Americans will elect as president someone who wants to destroy our economic system,"" he said. ""Elizabeth Warren is a socialist. Her proposals would destroy capitalism, and with it, the prosperity we enjoy today.""

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Varney said the second reason was due to Warren's ""demeanor,""

""Anger is Senator Warren's frequent theme, hating capitalism, the rich, the billionaires, Wall Street -- that plays well to socialists, but on your screens, every day for four years, anger is not so attractive,"" he said. ""... You've got to be good on TV to win these days.""

Varney also issued a warning to Democrats, saying they should be ""very worried,"" should ""far-left"" Warren win the nomination.

Who are saying that you can be funny but... you have to be funny within this progressive criteria.""

""I think it's mainly because people haven't taken aim at everyone yet,"" said Munasifi. ""I think a lot of the people who... have those types of opinions... that are more in line with censoring and deciding what you can and can't joke about... haven't had backlash aimed at them.""

He continued, ""I have seen reviews for [Dave Chappelle's Netflix special]. I know that they are largely negative, and the audience reviews are overwhelmingly positive, so there is definitely a disconnect between the few people in the media... and those critiquing and labeling these things... where people are actually laughing at it.""

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Bill Hemmer, Verma said President Trump's executive order – which would expand the program's private insurance option – is ""all about demonstrating his vision to protect and secure the Medicare program.""

In the executive order, the Trump administration claims his Medicare plan will:

Provide more plan choices and time with providers

Streamline approval of therapies

Reform link payments with value

Eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse

Reduce regulation

""He's just building on the tremendous success that we've already had with the program,"" she told Hemmer. ""President Trump's Medicare program is putting money back into the pockets of seniors. We've lowered out-of-pocket costs for drugs and for doctors' visits.""

She added that Medicare Advantage rates were announced at historic lows, citing lower Part D premiums and decreases in drug pricing.

Medicare itself remains popular, but 2020 Democratic presidential candidates' calls to enact a single-payer, government-run system for everyone are far more controversial. Speaking to a retirement community in Florida on Thursday, the president said Democrats want to ""raid Medicare to fund the idea of socialism.""

""All of the Democrats' plans would totally devastate our health care plans,"" he exclaimed.

Sanders' ""single-payer"" approach would cover people of any age and would incorporate the Medicare program. Private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option used by about one-third of seniors, would no longer have a role.

Sanders, who underwent a heart procedure this week, has argued that ""Medicare-for-all"" would offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs.

""In all of these versions, whether it's 'Medicare-for-all' or the public option ... what they're talking about is a government takeover of our private health care system stripping 180 million Americans from private coverage and putting them into a government-run program,"" Verma explained.

""What we've seen from other countries that have tried these socialist experiments is that that leads to reductions in care, reduced access, long wait times, and rationing of care,"" she said.

The 72-year-old Schwarzenegger has engaged in a long-standing feud with President Trump, who Schwarzenegger replaced as host of NBC's ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2015. Last month, Schwarzenegger said that Trump wanted to be him and was ""in love"" with him.

“I don’t think he fears me,"" the former ""Terminator"" star said during an interview. ""But I remember that in the old days when we went to the wrestling matches, the way he admired people with bodies, and the way they would jump around in the ring, and to perform physical stunts and stuff like that — he had great admiration for that.""

Trump previously bashed Schwarzenegger for his performance on the reality show.

""Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad [pathetic] ratings, not by me. Sad end to great show,"" Trump tweeted in 2017. In that same year, Schwarzenegger said he wanted to ""smash"" Trump's ""face.""

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., according to Judge Jeanine Pirro.

Sen. Sanders, I-Vt., incorrectly characterized Warren as a true capitalist, Pirro claimed Monday on ""The Five.""

Speaking about Warren's Accountable Capitalism Act, Pirro said she believed the Democrat's claim to be a capitalist is unfounded.

""What she wants to do is she wants shareholders and customers and employees to make the decisions of the corporation,"" Pirro said.

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS A 'CAPITALIST'

Pirro also claimed Warren wants to use shareholder profits to support social justice and environmental protection.

""What she's looking to do is change everything. The last thing this woman is is a capitalist,"" she said.

In an interview, however, Sanders criticized Warren, saying she is a capitalist, but he himself is not.

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ""I am a capitalist to my bones.""

On ""The Five,"" host Greg Gutfeld echoed Pirro's remarks, saying the attack is actually a compliment.

""That is the best thing that has been said about her all year,"" he quipped."

For the better part of the year, former Vice President Joe Biden dominated the polls and the other candidates in the race attacked him from the left, which is weird to see.

Biden still believed in law enforcement and international borders, and he opposed forced bussing, along with virtually every other American. So he was obviously one of those right-wing extremists from the Obama administration.

That's what they were telling you on the debate stage. It was bizarre.

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

Thankfully, that line of attack is over because Joe Biden's presidential campaign itself is in effect over. Nobody thinks Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee. Elizabeth Warren is the front-runner now. That's not contested. The race is now hers to lose.

So during Tuesday night's debate, her rivals on the stage decide to help her do just that -- lose.

Pete Buttigieg, South Bend, Ind. mayor: Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything ... except this.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.: At least Bernie is being honest here in saying how he is going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Joe Biden: I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one in this stage that has gotten anything really big done.

Klobuchar: And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.

Biden: I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it.

Klobuchar: I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

Beto O'Rourke: Sometimes, I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

She is punitive? When Beto O'Rourke, Mr. Armed Federal Agents Coming to Your House, calls you out for divisive attacks, it's time to pay attention. And in fact, he does make a fair point.

The main reason Warren has surpassed Bernie Sanders in the hearts of primary voters despite pretty close economic programs is that she is the one far more willing to descend into the filth of identity politics.

Bernie is an ideologue. There are some things that he just won't say. Elizabeth Warren will say anything.

Recently, she tweeted this: ""Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. And that starts with using correct pronouns. I'm Elizabeth. My pronouns are she/her/hers.""

In case you were wondering -- in case there was any question at all -- that kind of posturing is central to Elizabeth Warren's campaign. She is happy to tell you, and often does, that you're worth less, or you're worth more, based on how you were born.

Unfortunately, that works right now in the Democratic Party.

One thing Elizabeth Warren is not willing to say, however, is how much her single-payer government health care plan will cost -- trillions of dollars, obviously. Nobody disputes that. Nobody disputes that.

And in fact, as a mathematical matter, there's no way to raise that kind of money without hiking taxes on the middle class. It's simple arithmetic. And yet for some reason, Warren refuses to admit that.

Marc Lacey, national editor for the New York Times: You have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan ""Medicare-for-All."" Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: So I have made clear but my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.

Lacey: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been ""evasive"" about how she is going to pay for ""Medicare-for-All."" What's your response?

Buttigieg: Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.

Save that tape.

There are a lot of moments in debates that seem like a huge deal at the time. Everyone is yapping about them. But in the end, it turned out to be completely meaningless. This is not one of those moments.

Health care is always at the top of voters' concerns and so are taxes for that matter. If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

Even a post-debate MSNBC panel acknowledged as much.

Claire McCaskill, former U.S. senator: I thought she seemed a little petulant at times when she was being challenged.

Eugene Robinson, Washington Post columnist: You think, a little?

McCaskill: A little.

Robinson: As Bernie Sanders says she just won't go there, and she was pummeled for it.

Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn.org: They attacked her and she was uncomfortable. She did not handle it very well.

So was it really that bad for Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday night? We'll see.

She definitely got better treatment than Joe Biden got. Journalists don't like Joe Biden. Biden has zero allies in America's ""woke"" newsrooms. Warren, by contrast, has plenty of allies pretending to be journalists.

For example, on Wednesday morning, NYU ""journalism"" professor Jay Rosen -- the guy whose name often pops up, despite no talent whatsoever -- demanded that reporters stop asking specific questions about Warren's policies.

Again, a journalism professor telling you not to ask questions. Rosen tweeted: ""The 'make Elizabeth warren say she would raise taxes on the middle class' question should be a credibility killer. For the journalists who keep asking it.""

Now amazingly, Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post agreed with that. She wrote this: ""Journalists are kindly doing President Trump's work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Senator Elizabeth Warren to declare she would raise taxes to fund Medicare-for-All. Of course, it's legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad.""

Did you listen to that? Two journalists telling you, if the answer hurts Democrats, don't ask the question. Don't tell your readers or viewers what the truth is if it increases the chances that Donald Trump could get reelected.

Is that journalism? No, it's pure propaganda. It is the definition of propaganda. Jay Rosen, journalism professor, telling journalists not to ask questions.

Unbelievable.

Elizabeth Warren during the most recent Democratic presidential debate Tuesday for going too easy on big corporations.

The “Fahrenheit 9/11” filmmaker, 65, was tweeting during the event when something the 70-year-old presidential candidate said caught his attention. Warren explained that she has a plan to combat corporations only caring about their bottom line that she calls “accountable capitalism.”

MICHAEL MOORE BLASTS PRESIDENT TRUMP AT CANNES FILM FESTIVAL

In short, the plan calls on companies to be held accountable to their employees and their local communities rather than just shareholders. Moore, who has an estimated net worth of $50 million and who Business Insider previously reported has nine homes, is typically known for his left-leaning point of view. He took issue with Warren’s plan in that it doesn’t do enough to dismantle capitalism.

“Senator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in ‘accountable capitalism,’” Moore tweeted Tuesday. “There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It’s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.”

The “Bowling for Columbine” director also took jabs at former Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg for their respective stances on healthcare at the debate.

“Joe Biden, Amy K and Pete B just boosted the Republican chances of winning in November 2020 by their passionate defense of the for-profit, capitalist-greed health ‘care’ system,” he tweeted.

The only one that appeared safe from Moore’s taunts was Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Wow! BERNIE’S BACK!” he wrote. “Fighting the fight for working people for three long hours — just two weeks after a heart attack! Jeez. Amazing!”

Sanders returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked at the debate how he could “reassure” Americans that he was up for the task.

Harris previously sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in which she listed a series of problems she had with the president's Twitter activity. When asked about the idea, Warren laughed it off and flatly rejected it at the beginning of October.

Harris apparently saw that and referenced her answer during Tuesday's Democratic debate. ""I would urge you to join me,"" she said before claiming that Trump used Twitter to ""obstruct justice.""

Harris also pointed to August's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, claiming the perpetrator was ""informed"" by how Trump used the platform.

WARREN LAUGHS OFF SUGGESTION THAT TWITTER BAN AFTER TRUMP AFTER HARRIS' CALL FOR SUSPENSION

""This is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site,"" she said. ""It is a matter of safety.""

Warren seemed to agree Trump should leave Twitter but didn't explicitly endorse his suspension. ""So look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job,"" she said.

When Harris pressed Warren on joining her call to suspend Trump, Warren shook her head and said ""no."" Harris, apparently surprised, smiled and said ""wow.""

Harris ignited a Twitter controversy in October after she alerted Dorsey to one of Trump's tweets. At that point, she had already sent her letter in which she told the company: ""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.""

""Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation. Elected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society,"" the post read.

Elizabeth Warren is known as the candidate with the plans, but Senate colleague and presidential nomination rival Sen. Cory Booker begs to differ.

“There’s no bigger policy wonk nerd in this race than me. Anybody who knows me in the Senate, that’s my forte,” Booker, D-N.J., highlighted Monday in an interview with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com.

Booker, who was interviewed aboard his campaign’s New Hampshire RV, emphasized that “there’s been 170-180 plans put out by every candidate. We’re all putting out plans. I love mine. I think in so many cases my plans are better. Heck, we are the only people to put out a plan on child poverty. How can that be?”

WARREN SAYS SHE'LL UNVEIL HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR HER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL PLAN

And, he indirectly took aim at Warren, D-Mass., who’s soared in recent months to a tie with former Vice President Joe Biden for the top spot in the 2020 primary race.

“I stand with Elizabeth Warren. I think ‘Medicare-for-all’ is the best way to do it. But, I also actually believe that it’s going to be a process to get there,” Booker noted. “We can’t be in a situation where we’re just talking away insurance from folks.”

Warren has been a major supporter of the “Medicare-for-all” plan introduced in the Senate by 2020 rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. The government-run plan, if enacted, would eliminate private insurance.

Booker, spotlighting his pragmatism, added, “I will not be one of those folks on the stage that’s so rigid to say, ‘It’s my way or the highway and I’m going to sacrifice progress for purity. I’m going to let perfect be the enemy of the good,’ when every American needs more good.”

Asked if some of his nomination rivals were too rigid, Booker answered, “that’s what voters are going to have to decide.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren came under repeated attack at last week’s fourth-round primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for middle-class Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run “Medicare-for-all” plan. She announced Sunday that she would soon reveal how the country would pay for it if she were president.

Booker has built up a formidable team in New Hampshire and Iowa, the first two states to vote in the caucus and primary calendar. Analysts have called him a skilled retail campaigner and arguably the best orator in the record-setting field of presidential contenders. But, he’s yet to pop in the polls or have many viral moments.

However, with three and a half months to go until the voting begins, that’s fine with Booker.

“The people that usually win are the people who peak in January, February, not people who are winning in the summer or winning in the fall. We’ve just got to continue doing the work,” he noted.

And, pointing to one-time longshots who ended up winning the nomination and eventually the White House, he said, “the more people who hear my message, the more [success] and momentum we’re getting and I’m hoping that continues to rise. And, by the time we’re in next year, I hope we’ll do what Bill Clinton, the comeback kid, or Jimmy Carter – who won New Hampshire – I’ll follow in their footsteps.”"

The line of questioning started with Sanders, I-Vt., who just returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked how he could “reassure” Americans that he was up for the task.

“We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I’m going to reassure the American people,” Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. “I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Next came Biden—whose age has been a topic of conversation and criticism over the past several months on the campaign trail. CNN’s Erin Burnett quoted former President Jimmy Carter, who said that he wouldn’t have been able to start a presidential term at the age of 80, and pressed Biden why he thinks he could handle the pressure.

“Because I watched it, I know what the job is, I’ve been engaged,” Biden, 76, said, adding that “one of the reasons” he is running for president is his age—and with that, comes “wisdom.”

“We need someone in office this time around who on day one, on the world stage, can command respect from world leaders and know exactly what needs to be done to get this country back on track,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run this time because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before, I’ve been there.”

He added: “I will not need any on the job training.”

Biden, who has grappled with sustained critical media coverage of a string of gaffes on the campaign trail, then vowed to release his health records, along with his tax records, before the Iowa Caucuses in January—the first contest of the 2020 primary season.

“I’m the only guy who’s released anything up here,” he scoffed.

Warren, D-Mass., who is 70, brushed off her age, when asked to respond.

“I say I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” she said.

Meanwhile, President Trump, who is 73, has said he feels “young” and is ready for another term of his administration.

“I feel like a young man. I am a young, vibrant man,” Trump said in April.

Should Trump be re-elected, he would be 74 on Jan. 20, 2021—Inauguration Day. Should the presidency go to one of the elder Democrats in the field—Biden would be 78; Sanders would be 79; and Warren would be 71.

But the CNN and New York Times moderators shifted to the other end of the spectrum, pointing to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, for her young age of 38.

“It’s not fair to ask these three about their health and their wellness,” she said of the questions to Biden, Sanders and Warren. “Who is fit to serve as commander-in-chief?”

Gabbard said that she was, and further challenged the moderators to ask every candidate on the stage about their age and health—a suggestion that was ignored."

William Jacobson, a law professor at Cornell Law School, owns and runs elizabethwarrenwiki.org — a website dedicated to various controversies surrounding the Democratic presidential candidate, particularly her claims of having Native American heritage.

ZUCKERBERG SAYS IF WARREN BECOMES PRESIDENT, FACEBOOK WOULD SUE US GOVERNMENT

He also ran an accompanying Facebook page, which posted articles from the site.

“It was a way of getting the content out to the public,” he told Fox News in an interview.

But on Monday afternoon, Jacobson received a notice saying the page had been taken down for violating Facebook's policies regarding impersonation. Facebook’s community standards forbid users from using other peoples’ images to deceive or mislead people about the origin of the content.

""Pages, groups and events must not impersonate or falsely represent a brand, entity or public figure,"" the policies state. ""Where a Page, group or event is being used to express support for or interest in a brand, entity or public figure, it must make clear in the name or description that it is not an official representation.""

But Jacobson maintains the page was in line with Facebook standards as it carried a disclaimer saying it was not affiliated with Warren’s campaign or Senate office. He posted a screengrab of the disclaimer in an article for Legal Insurrection. He also said the site never attempted to impersonate Warren, even with the disclaimer.

“The page is called 'Elizabeth Warren Wiki' and it has a link to the wiki website and all of the content posted was from the wiki website, so no one could look at the page and think this is her campaign or Senate office because everything was from the wiki website,” he said.

“I think we covered all our bases, and I don’t know how this happened,” he said.

Jacobson said he immediately filed an appeal via the Facebook process. By Tuesday evening, the page was restored.

""This page was mistakenly removed and has been restored,"" Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, told Fox News in an email.

In his original article flagging his concerns, Jacobson wrote: ""It’s another reminder, as when our YouTube page was taken down without warning, that we can’t rely on big tech.""

Before the page was restored, Jacobson wondered if a recent feud between Warren’s supporters and those of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was partly responsible.

“All I know is the last couple of days there was a Twitter war between Bernie and Warren supporters, and Bernie’s supporters were linking to the wiki website,” he said. “It might be pure coincidence or it might be that someone decided to complain to Facebook about the page.”

The suspension came just as comments emerged from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg warning that the company may have to sue the government if Warren becomes president.

The announcement came in a campaign video posted to Twitter, which shows the Massachusetts senator visiting a neighborhood in southwest Detroit, often referred to as the most polluted area in Michigan, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who represents the district. In the clip, Warren speaks to community members about residents who have been diagnosed with cancer linked to exposure to toxins after years of living in the shadow of a massive oil refinery.

WARREN FACING SCRUTINY OVER CLAIM SHE WAS FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT

In line with her overarching campaign to end corruption in Washington, Warren calls the pollution in these communities a result of “decades of discrimination and environmental racism,” saying it is “unacceptable and it must change.”

The plan, which has been posted to her website, builds upon policies covering everything from affordable housing to green manufacturing to clean energy. She stresses the need to build “strong, resilient communities” by doing more than just “cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.”

According to the campaign, this would mean identifying the most at-risk communities and requiring all federal agencies to consider the climate impact of any proposed projects. Warren also calls for investing in the nation’s public water systems, ending the privatization of those systems and enforcing water quality standards.

The plan is vague on how exactly the $1 trillion would be spent, but also calls for grants to long-term residents of ""redlined"" communities that were once discriminated against financially ""so that they can buy homes in the neighborhood of their choice and start to build wealth.""

Warren's plan is one of many multitrillion-dollar commitments from the Democratic field that have raised questions over how they would be funded. Her climate policy claims that an added corporate profit tax, as well as reversing part of the Trump administration's tax cuts, would finance the programs.

WARREN SLIPS AHEAD OF BIDEN IN LATEST POLL

Warren also vows to get tough on polluting companies. This includes reinstituting the Superfund Waste Tax, which ensures hazardous waste sites are properly cleaned up and expired in 1995. “Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions — not leave them for the communities to clean up.

The Trump administration has pushed back against reports that officials are looking into ways to curb US investment in China, a development that would open a new front in a more than yearlong trade dispute between the largest economies.

Bloomberg News reported last week that administration officials had held internal discussions about the potential to remove Chinese companies from American stock exchanges, as well as several other actions that would restrict American portfolio flows into China. Several other news outlets including the New York Times confirmed the report.

The White House declined to comment on Monday. Bloomberg News could not immediately be reached.

""That story, which appeared in Bloomberg: I've read it far more carefully than it was written,"" White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday. ""Over half of it was highly inaccurate or simply flat-out false.""

Navarro did not specify which parts of the report he disputed. Treasury spokesperson Monica Crowley said over the weekend the administration was not ""contemplating blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges at this time.""

China warned the Trump administration against such actions Monday, days before officials were set to meet for high-level trade negotiations in Washington. The two sides have seen tensions escalate dramatically in recent weeks, with further tariff hikes scheduled to take place in October and December.

""To exert extreme pressure and even attempt to force the decoupling of China-US relations will definitely damage the interests of US and Chinese enterprises and people, cause financial market turmoil and endanger international trade and the world economic growth,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said.

Hopes for a deal to defuse tensions dimmed this summer, even as businesses and consumers warned of damage to both economies. President Donald Trump has long vacillated between apparent optimism toward China and threats that the dispute could last into 2020 and beyond.

Warren ignored the protesters as they held up signs and continued to shout at her.

“Welcome to Reno ⁦@ewarren! This is @teamtrump country!!” Nevada Republican Party state Chairman Michael J. McDonald wrote in a separate tweet.

Warren spoke to a much larger and friendlier crowd in Carson City on Wednesday evening – but a Trump supporter holding a “Keep America Great” sign interrupted her speech, prompting the crowd of Warren backers to chant ""Lock him up!”

""There's a lot we need to do,” Warren said to the crowd, according to New York Times reporter Thomas Kaplan, who tweeted the video. “And I understand, I understand that Donald Trump and his supporters are getting really nervous, and they have a good reason to be.""

Support for Warren has surged among Democrats in recent weeks, with the candidate passing former Vice President Joe Biden by four points in a new national poll released this week.

Warren spoke earlier Wednesday at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas.

Biden was also in Nevada on Wednesday, making a campaign stop in Reno, where he attacked Trump for his alleged “abuse of power.”

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have called for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren asked Belfort to weigh in on the current 2020 Democratic field, as many of the leading candidates have long criticized the financial industry.

""If one of these people gets into office, it will be a Warren or Sanders destruction.” — Jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amok, it gets really ugly,"" said Belfort. ""What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… but the policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said.

However, Belfort said that he believed that Trump will emerge with a victory in 2020.

“If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, OK? Because I think that this nation would be literally destroyed,"" he said. ""If one of these people gets into office—a Warren or Sanders—destruction.”

“He's a great salesman,"" Belfort continued, praising the president.

""I wish that he would say things in a way that p*** people off less because it doesn't help… but I can’t judge because he's president. I didn't become president, he did. I went to jail.”

Later in the episode, Belfort opened up about his notorious financial rise, devastating downfall, and how his time in prison helped reinvent his future.

“Of course, I'm remorseful about what happened,"" said Belfort, responding to Lahren, who questioned whether he regretted his past actions.

“I deserved to go to jail,"" Belfort continued. ""I definitely deserved to go to jail, it was a positive experience,” he recalled. “I thought the judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really [make sure]… I'll never forget—that was terrible. Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.”

Belfort was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which shed light on his early life and white-collar crimes that led to his eventual time in prison.

After serving 22 months between 2004 and 2006 for securities fraud totaling over $200 million, Belfort was also ordered to return $110 million to investors.

Following his time in prison, Belfort worked on his sobriety and began to write his book -- which would serve as a basis for the film. Belfort described becoming sober and writing the book as pivotal experiences in his path to rehabilitation.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the U.S. government, responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. It was created by Congress in 2010 to be an autonomous entity, structured so each director serves a five-year term and can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

MICHAEL MOORE ENDORSES BERNIE SANDERS: 'HE ISN'T AFRAID TO SAY CAPITALISM IS THE PROBLEM'

Warren, D-Mass., touted on the campaign trail that the bureau returned $12 billion to consumers during the Obama administration, The Washington Post reported. She uses the figure to push a presidential platform based on attacking corporate greed and increasing taxes on wealthy Americans.

“Big banks and their Republican allies have been trying to kill the CFPB for years, and the Trump administration is hoping the right-wing, pro-corporate Supreme Court will help. I’ve got news for them: Like it or not, the CFPB is constitutional,” Warren said on Twitter.

An attorney for the Trump administration told the Supreme Court in a brief last month that even the bureau’s current director, Kathleen Kraninger, who was sworn in in 2018, believes the structure of the CFPB violates the separation of powers clause of the Constitution given its director cannot be fired by the president without sufficient cause.

Critics of the bureau say the Constitution gives the president the power to remove top-ranking executive branch officials for any reason or none at all. They say the founders were wary of power being entrusted to any one individual who had not been elected into office, the Washington Times reported.

The Supreme Court “has consistently recognized that the Constitution empowers the president to keep federal officers accountable by removing them from office,” Washington lawyer Kannon K. Shanmugam wrote in the brief, according to The Washington Post.

“While in limited circumstances the court has upheld the constitutionality of certain multi-member ‘independent’ agencies ... the court has never upheld the constitutionality of an independent agency that exercises significant executive authority and is headed by a single person.”

Republicans and banking executives have opposed the bureau since its inception, arguing it often pushing legal margins to slap unnecessary penalties on financial intuitions. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney once described the bureau as “a joke” and supported legislation to disband it, the Post reported.

Lower court ruling on the constitutionality of the bureau have been conflicting. A three-judge panel on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, which included then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh before he became a Supreme Court Justice, ruled the CFPB was unconstitutional. The entire court later overturned the decision, the Times reported."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate, but the former vice president has a potentially larger headache – a lack of campaign cash.

As Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.

BIDEN'S THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING HAUL A WARNING SIGN

According to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.

Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, pressed on the report, told reporters in the spin room after the debate in suburban Columbus, Ohio that “it’s more important how you spend the money than how you raise it.""

And she emphasized that “we have resources that we need to continue to run our race. We’ve always said we think this race is going to be a dogfight, that it’s going to go long. We’re building an operation that is going to be sustained.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

On Wednesday, Biden said he was confident he had the fundraising to make it to the general election.

“Our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online. And we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready,” he told reporters at a campaign event in Ohio.

And taking aim at Warren – who transferred more than $10 million from her 2018 Senate re-election campaign to her White House bid – Biden noted he “did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from, into a race.”

It was just two weeks ago that Biden was left in the dust by Warren, Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg when it came to their third-quarter fundraising hauls. And unlike Warren and Sanders – who’ve brought in most of their money from small-dollar grassroots donations -- much of Biden’s money comes from top-dollar fundraising events with big-bucks donors.

A Democratic consultant who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely called the $15.2 million Biden raised in the third quarter “a devastating number.”

Taking an indirect shot at Biden, Warren campaign chief strategist Joe Rospars highlighted the new data released Tuesday.

“The FEC report data are pretty stark. There’s nowhere to hide from the reality of the dollars and the calendar in front of us,” Rospars tweeted on Wednesday. “Is a campaign’s fundraising growing? Is its spending able to grow going into the early contests, as it must? For Warren, the answers are yes and yes.”

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.

Ceraso, who worked on Sanders’ 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or “his cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.”

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised left him, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

Republicans spotlighted Biden’s campaign cash on hand figures as a warning sign for a candidate who has already relinquished his status as the unrivaled front-runner in the polls.

“Biden’s money problems are now a crisis for the campaign and if he doesn’t turn it around soon, he’ll end up on the sidelines sooner than anyone anticipated,” emphasized Joe Gierut, press secretary for the pro-Republican America Rising PAC.

Fundraising is far from definitive, but like polling, it’s an important barometer of a candidate’s momentum and his or her campaign’s strength. Among the things funds can be used for are building staff and grassroots outreach efforts in the crucial early voting states and running TV, radio, and digital ads.

Biden ‘eclipsed’ on 2020 debate stage

The spotlight on the former vice president’s campaign cash numbers came as the spotlight at the debate shifted from him to Warren, who has soared in recent months and is now tied in most national and early voting state polling with Biden for the top spot in the nomination race.

Biden was front-and-center as the debate kicked off, focusing on the Ukrainian controversy and the impeachment inquiry.

But when the conversation turned to the battle over ""Medicare-for-all,"" the former vice president was mostly absent from the discussion as the spotlight shifted to Warren.

The populist senator, who has produced one progressive policy proposal after another, grabbed the most speaking time in the debate, roughly six more minutes than Biden, who was second.

“He faded at times,” noted Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of the Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor. ""He popped his head up occasionally.

“He did allow himself to get eclipsed by some others, like Buttigieg and (Sen. Amy) Klobuchar and some of the others,” added Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign who later steered communications for the Democratic National Committee. “He’s got to step up. He cannot miss opportunities and I think he missed a few.”

GOP strategist and presidential campaign veteran Colin Reed called Biden “nearly invisible” at the debate and said it’s “a sign of how far this campaign has fallen that no one bothers to go after him.”

But Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a top Biden friend and 2020 surrogate, told reporters in the spin room on Tuesday night that being out of the spotlight benefitted Biden.

“Unlike previous debates where the vast majority of the attention was focused on testing or challenging Vice President Biden, tonight was a night when Sen. Warren’s plans on a wide range of issues – from the wealth tax to 'Medicare-for-all' – came under repeated questioning,” Coons highlighted.

Biden echoed that sentiment on Wednesday, saying ""it's kind of about time other people get questioned.""

And he pushed back on the labeling of Warren as a co-front-runner, saying “I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., received a chorus of praise on Thursday after she dunked on traditional beliefs about marriage -- but was the proverbial pitch grooved to her by a friendly donor?

The man who asked that question was Morgan Cox III, who sits on the Board of Directors for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). HRC is the organization that co-hosted CNN's ""LGBTQ Town Hall"" on Thursday and happens to be one of the nation's foremost advocacy groups on the issue. The event was closed to the public and only included invited guests, stakeholders in the movement, and members of “civic organizations,” according to the group.

Donor data also revealed that a man matching Cox's profile donated at least $5,400 to Warren in 2017 and 2018: A Morgan Cox III from Plano, Texas, gave $2,700 to Warren in July of 2017, $1,000 in April of 2018, and another $1,700 that same April.

When Cox was introduced on Thursday, CNN described him as someone tied to a ""real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas."" Both Cox's Linkedin profile and HRC's website say he's based in Plano, Texas. His Linkedin profile also notes that he works as a partner at Marquis Group, a real estate firm based in Texas.

ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS SHE WON'T HOLD 'BIG DOLLAR FUNDRAISERS' NO MATTER HOW MUCH TRUMP RAISES

Cox, on Thursday, prompted a catchy response from Warren after he asked her: ""Let's say you're on the campaign trail ... and a supporter approaches you and says, 'Senator, I am old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.' What is your response?""

""Well, I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that,"" Warren told Cox, drawing laughter from the audience. ""And I'm going to say, 'Then just marry one woman.'""

After more laughter and applause, Warren let loose an apparent jab at the hypothetical supporters. ""Assuming you can find one,"" she quipped, turning and rubbing her hands together.

Online, Warren experienced an outpouring of support. ""Elizabeth Warren had a perfect zinger at CNN’s LGBTQ town hall when asked about gay marriage,"" New York Magazine declared on Friday.

ELIZABETH WARREN FACES MOUNTING QUESTIONS ON ANOTHER PART OF HER PERSONAL STORY: WAS SHE FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT?

HRC is perhaps most well-known for its simple equality logo which features a yellow ""equals"" sign against a blue backdrop. Its mission statement reads: ""HRC strives to end discrimination against LGBTQ people and realize a world that achieves fundamental fairness and equality for all.""

The group has clashed with conservatives on issues surrounding religious liberty. It previously lambasted certain laws as ""cruel"" because they allowed religious adoption agencies to obtain exemptions from serving same-sex couples. In an op-ed from August of 2018, the organization's president compared Trump's Religious Liberty Task Force to oppressive tactics African-Americans faced during the Civil Rights era.

Several times on the campaign trail, Warren suggested that she was effectively fired from a school where she taught children with special needs because she was ""visibly pregnant."" However, in a 2007 interview, Warren appeared to have left on her own accord.

""My first-year post-graduation, I worked -- it was in a public school system but I worked with the children with disabilities. I did that for a year, and then that summer I actually didn’t have the education courses, so I was on an 'emergency certificate,' it was called,"" Warren said at the time. ""I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, 'I don’t think this is going to work out for me. I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years, and I was really casting about, thinking, 'What am I going to do?'""

In an interview with CBS News on Monday, Warren stood by what she has repeatedly said on the campaign trail.

""All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,"" Warren told CBS News.

Her campaign also issued a statement in an attempted to explain the discrepancy between now and 2007, implying that she has learned to ""open up"" since she became a public figure.""

""After becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them. I wrote about it in my book when I became a U.S. Senator,"" Warren said in a statement.

By contrast, Warren told an audience at a town hall in Carson City, Nev. Wednesday that she had ""loved"" working as a special needs teacher.

""By the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days,"" she said. ""Wish me luck and hire someone else for the job.""

Warren has repeated the story at campaign appearances throughout the summer, each time repeating the ""principal did what principals did"" line to describe her departure from teaching.

The senator's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to clarify the apparent discrepancy.

This isn't the first time that Warren's past has raised questions about her credibility. She has been widely criticized for identifying herself as a Native American in legal directories before applying to work at Harvard Law School. Last year, Warren released the results of a DNA test showing she is only between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American -- and apologized for identifying as Native American on past forms."

The new survey, conducted by the Saint Anselm College Survey Center and released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary – in a distant third place.

Warren, the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another, stands at 25 percent in the survey. Biden, the front-runner in most polls of voters nationwide and in early primary and caucus states since before announced his candidacy in late April, is at 24 percent. The margin between Warren and Biden is well within the poll's margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN, SANDERS SLIPS, IN NEW NH PRIMARY POLL

“There remain several months before New Hampshire Democrats cast their primary ballots, but Warren and Biden have clearly separated themselves from the rest of the field,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics executive director Neil Levesque emphasized.

“If the dynamic of Warren as the candidate that best expresses Democratic voters’ policy preferences and Biden as the one who has the best chance of beating Trump sets in with voters, this is likely turning into a two-person race absent a big shake-up,” he added.

Sanders, the populist independent senator, stands at 11 percent in the survey, with South Bend, Ind. Mayor Buttigieg a point back at 10 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris of California registers at 5 percent in the survey to round out the top five.

The poll’s release comes hours after Sanders reported raising a whopping $25.3 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, with Buttigieg hauling in $19.1 million and Harris bringing in $11.6 million.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25 MILLION JULY-SEPT. CAMPAIGN CASH HAUL

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are each at 3 percent in the survey. Businessman and billionaire environmental and progressive activist Tom Steyer and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are each at 2 percent, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 1 percent. Everyone else sampled came in at less than 1 percent, with 9 percent undecided with just over four months to go until primary day.

Levesque highlighted that “there is still some fluidity in this race, as 65 percent of Warren supporters, 72 percent of Biden supporters, 56 percent of Sanders supporters, and 73 percent of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Among voters who were not firm in their choice of candidate, was the second choice of 26 percent, followed by Biden (12 percent), Buttigieg (11 percent), Sanders and Harris (7 percent each)

Warren also topped the field of candidates on the question of who would make the best president (27 percent, compared to 19 percent who picked Biden). But Biden came out on top when voters were asked who would be the strongest nominee to take on Republican President Donald Trump in next year’s general election (37 percent, compared to 26 percent who picked Warren).

The St. Anselm poll came out a week after a Monmouth University survey in New Hampshire grabbed national attention for indicating that Warren and Biden fighting for the top spot, with Sanders a distant third.

Previous Granite State polls released earlier in September and in late August were all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third showing Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

(CNN) Donald Trump has every reason to be concerned about taking on former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, especially given that a Fox News poll released this week found him trailing Biden by a whopping 14 points if the election were held now. But Trump's greatest threat may in fact come from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who leads Trump by six points in the poll.

Per a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the second choice of 10%

Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a little over ten points . But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020.

Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail.

True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events."

Elizabeth Warren is now at the top tier of the 2020 field in the crucial Iowa caucuses. That notion drastically undersells how strong a position Warren is actually in.

Yes, Warren tops the field in the CNN-DMR poll with 22% support, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden at 20% (the poll has a four-point margin of error, putting the two essentially in a tie). Warren and Biden are followed distantly by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 11%.

But that doesn't tell the whole story: The topline numbers are actually the least good thing for Warren in the poll.

Consider this:

* Warren gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

* Her favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is behind her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

* Warren is the first or second choice of 42% of those polled. That's well in front of Biden (30% first/second combined), Sanders (21%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (16%).

Any one of those three data points would suggest that this poll may have only caught the start of Warren's rise in Iowa. All three together suggest she is well positioned to take off like a rocket ship in the state. Not only does she already have a broad-base of support in the state (as evidence by the topline numbers) but she also has significant passion among those who are for her and remains well-liked -- and a possible voting option -- for those who say she is their second choice at the moment.

That's not even taking into account Warren's grassroots operation, which is widely regarded as the best -- by a lot -- of any campaign in Iowa. Wrote the Des Moines Register on Sunday:

""Elizabeth Warren's slow but steady rise in the first-in-the-nation caucus state is as much a result of her robust organizational presence here as it is a response to the Massachusetts senator's many plans and policies, Iowa experts say ... the (poll) results were not surprising, said several Iowa Democrats who have watched Warren build out a team that is widely credited with having the most sophisticated organizational presence in the state.""

Add it all up and you get this: With 133 days left before the February 3 caucuses, Warren is the clear Iowa front-runner. There's simply no one else who can make anywhere near as strong a case -- either by polling or staff or both -- as Warren in the state.

Now, OF COURSE, 133 days is a long time in politics. Things can change. If past is prologue, there will be a handful of up and downs within the top tier between now and February 3. But it's very clear from the polling trends that Iowa is now Warren's to lose."
256,"Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Polling Director",,"A surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren is challenging Joe Biden's dominance in the race for the Democratic nomination, standing at 22% to the former vice president's 20% in a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers.",2019-09-22,CNN,"Elizabeth Warren surges and Joe Biden fades in close Iowa race, new poll shows",https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/21/politics/iowa-poll-2020-democrats/index.html,"(CNN) A surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren is challenging Joe Biden's dominance in the race for the Democratic nomination, standing at 22% to the former vice president's 20% in a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers.

Warren's improved standing overall in the Iowa poll comes on the heels of a stronger showing in recent national polls and is bolstered by an increasing positive favorability rating (75% have a favorable view, the best in the field, and she is one of only four candidates who have improved their net favorability since the June CNN/DMR poll), as well as a growing percentage of likely caucusgoers who say she is either their first choice, second choice or someone they are actively considering. All told, 71% are at least considering Warren's candidacy, ahead of the next best candidate on that score by 11 points (Biden at 60%). Her supporters are also more enthusiastic than those behind Biden (32% of her backers are extremely enthusiastic vs. 22% for the former vice president).

The Massachusetts senator appears to be gaining ground primarily at the expense of Sanders. She holds the support of 32% of those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016 (Sanders himself stands at 25% among that group), stands at 48% among those who consider themselves ""very liberal,"" and for the first time in CNN/DMR polling on the race, has edged ahead of Sanders among those under age 35 (27% back Warren, 22% Sanders).

Biden's core backers remain behind him in largely the same way they were in the previous poll. Among seniors, he is the first choice of 35%, about the same as earlier this year. And he remains above 30% support with moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers.

The freshman Democrat’s comments came after 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Pelosi added that Democrats should look at all the facts before deciding to move forward with impeachment proceedings.

The increase in Democrat calls for impeachment comes from an August whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official amid efforts from Democrats to learn more about Trump’s ties with Ukraine. These same Democrats are trying to get ahold of the complaint.

Trump acknowledged that he had talked with the Ukranian president about an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden while speaking with reporters on trips to Texas and Ohio on Saturday.

That remains true today.

What I've done is gathered Iowa caucuses' polls taken closest to this point in non-incumbent nomination processes since 1980. I then ran a simple model that controlled how high the best polling candidate was and figured out how often a candidate should win given where they were polling at this point. Keep in mind, these are rough odds.

What we see is that if history holds, someone in Warren's polling position should win about 30% of the time. That means, there's something like a 70% chance someone other than Warren wins the Iowa caucuses.

Someone in Biden's polling position should win about 25% of the time.

Someone at around 10%, like Buttigieg and Sanders, have about a 10% chance of winning.

Everyone else has less than a 10% chance of winning. Even Harris, who is at 6% in our poll, has something like a 7% chance of winning.

If you add up the top 5, their cumulative chance of winning is only between 80% and 85%. That means, there's still a 15% to 20% chance that someone not in the top 5 wins Iowa.

In other words, this race isn't over by any stretch."

Every Sunday, I will outline the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week.

5. The race to make the next debate: The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.)

At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.)

Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in the CNN-DMR poll .)

The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something.

4. Can Kamala come back?: Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez.

So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll. She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.)

Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%).

Harris does have time, as there are still 134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon.

3. Booker over and out?: Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race.

The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!)

""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary.""

Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that?

2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner: Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%.

While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today.

1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine: It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine.

Fact checkers have already debunked Trump's claims about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,"" he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like.""

It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him.

On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."

Trump, while speaking with reporters before departing the White House for events in Texas and Ohio, continued to defend his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but said the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate was discussed in the exchange.

""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters.

CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation . That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. On Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning later Sunday to the Trump administration, which has refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint, saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists.

The warning, shared in a letter to all House members, comes following a refusal last week by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn over the complaint to Congress. In her letter, Pelosi, a California Democrat, said if the administration's refusals continue, it would constitute a ""serious possible breach of constitutional duties by"" Trump and would take Congress ""into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Pelosi set a deadline for Maguire to turn over the full whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee during his scheduled appearance Thursday.

The Democratic leader's letter threatens investigation at a time when the White House is already facing House inquiries on multiple fronts and a continuing impeachment investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. The Trump administration has so far split on how to handle the details of the call, but any House-led investigation into the President's Ukraine contact could meet significant resistance from the White House, as it has stonewalled many of the congressional probes already in motion.

Pressure to impeach

Weighing in on the controversy earlier Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the complaint and phone call transcript.

""If the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,"" the California Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" stopping short of calling on Congress to immediately launch proceedings.

Schiff, who has so far resisted joining other Democrats in calling for impeachment, told Tapper he has been ""very reluctant"" to push for proceedings against the President because he sees it as a ""remedy of last resort,"" but also said Sunday that the President doesn't have the authority ""to engage in underhanded discussions."" The chairman's apparent edging toward impeachment follows pressure from others in his party -- including from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- to start proceedings.

On Friday, Warren, who is vying for her party's presidential nomination, tweeted that ""Congress is complicit"" in failing to start impeachment proceedings against Trump after news broke that he had allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.

Echoing Warren's sentiments, Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet on Saturday that her party's ""refusal to impeach"" Trump was an even bigger scandal than what she said was the President's ""lawbreaking behavior.""

Asked by Tapper Sunday about Trump keeping conversations with foreign leaders private, Schiff said: ""Well not if those conversations involve potential corruption or criminality or leverage being used for political advantage against our nation's interest.""

""This would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,"" he said, adding that he's not certain that the call is the subject of the complaint.

White House split on releasing calls

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters on Saturday that he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised.

The President on Sunday described his conversation with the Ukrainian president as ""warm and friendly"" and repeatedly urged reporters to look instead at Biden and Democrats, who he said -- without providing evidence -- have ""done some very bad things.""

But while the President suggested he was open to releasing the conversation, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there's no evidence such an action ""would be appropriate"" at this time.

""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point.""

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also weighed in, telling Tapper Sunday that he thinks releasing the transcript ""would be a terrible precedent,"" arguing that ""conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.""

As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The gold standard poll in Iowa showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.

The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission that he might have no path forward.

Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.

""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""

Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.

But Biden was also insistent that the focus should remain on Trump improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son.

""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""

But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.

He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.

Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""

Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""

""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.

In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.

The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.

That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.

Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.

""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.

Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.

Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers.

Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.

Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.

The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.

Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.

As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.

Harris' campaign has mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.

O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.

""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""

""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.

He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.

His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.

Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.

At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""

Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so.

He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""

""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said."

""I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn't,"" the Minnesota lawmaker added, according to the paper.

Omar's office confirmed the comments to CNN.

The comments from the progressive congresswoman were made as a number of the 2020 Democratic candidates pitched themselves this weekend in the first-in-the-nation caucus state as the best contender to take on President Donald Trump. Biden, the pack's centrist front-runner, has faced tough criticism from his fellow candidates for his record, which some have knocked as not being progressive enough.

Mitt Romney said Sunday that it ""would be troubling in the extreme"" if President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden amid an ongoing controversy over a call Trump had with the foreign leader that was part of a whistleblower complaint.

In a tweet, Romney, who was his party's presidential nominee in 2012, also said it was ""critical"" for the facts surrounding the call to emerge.

""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,"" Romney, who represents Utah, wrote in the tweet.

The comments from the prominent GOP senator are some of the strongest to come from his party, whose members have largely remained silent following news last week that a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General was concerned in part with a July 25 call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday, after Trump acknowledged that he discussed Biden during the call but maintained that the conversation was ""warm and friendly,"" congressional Democrats urged an investigation into the matter, with some calling for Trump's impeachment.

CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

That's a problem for Bernie Sanders.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/22/politics/union-health-care-medicare-for-all/index.html,"(CNN) Health care benefits are really important to many union workers -- important enough to give up pay raises or even to walk off the job to keep the coverage they've negotiated.

Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among 2020 Democratic candidates over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan.

The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor.

Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes eliminating employer-based coverage

Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people.

Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier.

Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.

""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.

The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction, auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care.

Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to repeal the provision

The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM.

Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US.

However, GM has also stopped paying for health insurance for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that union members wouldn't have to fear losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All.

Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too.

But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits.

""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people.

There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year.

""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said.

Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers.

""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""

Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a Workplace Democracy plan last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All.

A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition.

That may not be enough for some unions, though.

""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""

Many strikes are over quickly. In 2007, the last national strike against GM lasted only a few days. Another UAW strike against Chrysler that year was resolved in a matter of hours. To protect its strike fund, the UAW doesn't start parceling out strike benefits to members until Day 8.

The strike benefits will cost the union about $12.5 million a week. The UAW is also paying for members' health insurance during the strike, making Cobra payments on their behalf. The union had nearly $800 million in its strike fund at the end of last year, meaning that it could go about a year paying strike benefits before it would deplete the fund. The fund is built up over time by UAW member dues, which can come to about 2-1/2 hours pay per month.

Negotiators from the union andwere back at it on Monday morning, after holding talks throughout the weekend. The two sides report making some progress but say they remain far apart on many key issues. The strike began in the early hours of Monday, September 16.

The union is pressing the company to agree to relocate some vehicles built at plants in Mexico to the two US assembly plants that are slated to close. The union said GM builds far more vehicles in Mexico than rivalsof

GM said it has put forward ""solutions"" for the two plants — in Lordstown, Ohio and Detroit — and is offering to invest $7 billion in its American operations to create or keep 5,400 hourly jobs. A person familiar with the company's offer said it is proposing to build an electric truck in the Detroit plant and lithium batteries for electric vehicles in Lordstown. But that work probably wouldn't begin for several years, meaning the plants would be dark until then.

GM announced plans to close those facilities , as well as transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore in November. The four plants employed about 3,000 hourly workers when those closings were announced. GM said it has found other jobs for about 2,300 of those workers, but many people had to relocate.

The union and company are also reportedly still not in agreement on GM's use of temporary hourly workers, as well as about wages and benefits.

The strike is the longest national strike against GM in more than 20 years, one or two plants have been the target of longer strikes in the past. This strike has shut all of GM's 31 US factories spread across nine states, mostly in the center of the country, as well as 21 other facilities, idling nearly 50,000 hourly workers. It is the largest strike against a private sector business since the 2007 strike against GM.

The $250 benefits are much less than the pay that union members are losing because of the strike. GM says that hourly workers earn an average of $90,000 a year, although that includes profit sharing and overtime. To qualify for the strike pay, workers must walk the picket line or do other things related to the strike.

The strike benefits also are subject to income tax. The union will issue 1099 forms to members if their benefits cross the $600 mark.

There is pressure on GM to reach a settlement sooner rather than later. Moody's credit rating agency has said that if the strike goes on for more than one-to-two weeks, ""the financial burden of a strike will become more material."" That could be bad news for GM since it's credit rating rating is currently only one step above junk bond status . If it was downgraded into junk bond status, it could raise the cost of its borrowing in the future.

GM's debt was downgraded into junk bond status in 2005, several years before it ended up in bankruptcy court and in need of a federal bailout in 2009. It took until 2013 for it to shake that rating, and have its debt classified as ""investment grade.""

-- Update: This story has been updated to better reflect what Moody's credit rating statement could mean for GM.

-- Correction: An earlier version of the headline incorrectly stated how much the strikers will get paid from the UAW strike fund."

The focus group, conducted by Engagious/Focus Pointe Global and reported by Axios, included “included 7 women who flipped from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, and 2 who switched from Mitt Romney to Hillary Clinton.”

As Axios noted, while the focus group preferred Warren’s policies, they were put off by her personality.

While some described Warren as “nice,” and “confident,” they did not feel stirred by her or passionate about her.

“I like what she had to say but I still think she’s a sorry bitch,” one said. “I just — the way she acts, and some of the things — I just don’t care for her.”

Another disagreed with the use of the word “bitch” but said Warren said sounded “fake,” even if her ideas were good.

Warren has struggled to convince even her own voters of her electability. At a town hall meeting last month in Franconia, New Hampshire — the first to spark national attention to the growing size of Warren’s crowds — one attendee told Breitbart News that while she liked Warren, she could not see her beating President Donald Trump.

Though the Engagious/FPG data is accompanied by a warning that it is not a statistically representative sample, the information provides clues about what messages are currently resonating with the Democratic electorate.

Axios reports that the results “reflected the doubts that some people have about women in leadership,” but seven of the nine women said they did not know anyone who refused to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because of her gender. Six said that they would vote for Trump if the presidential election were to be held again tomorrow.

Two-thirds (six of nine) also said that it was worth some economic pain to fight China for fairer terms of trade.

A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll came to a slightly different conclusion — namely, that voters nationwide did not like Trump’s personality, but were also skeptical of the left-wing policies being offered by most Democrats.

Wisconsin was a key to Trump’s victory in 2016; Clinton avoided campaigning there, while Trump made several visits to the state in the last days of the election. Democrats will hold their 2020 convention in Milwaukee.

The Des Moines Register added that “no other candidate reaches double digits,” with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) coming in fourth place with nine percent support, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) dropping to fifth place with six percent support, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) garnering three percent support each.

Four candidates – Beto O’Rourke (D), Tom Steyer (D), Andrew Yang (D), and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI)– garnered two percent. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less.

Selzer & Co. president J. Ann Selzer called the results the “first major shakeup” in the Democrat primary race.

“It’s the first time we’ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board,” Selzer said, according to the Des Moines Register.

The poll also found Warren’s favorability at 75 percent, with Buttigieg right behind with 69 percent.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared herself vindicated for being less than two percent Native American, the former Harvard University professor is leading in multiple state and national polls for the 2020 Democrat nomination for president.

In the most recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll out of Iowa, Warren took the lead with 22 percent of Democrat primary voters for the first time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, fell to second place with 20 percent, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) trailed in third with 11 percent.

When Democrat primary voters were asked who their second choice for president would be, Warren gained 20 percent of voters for a combined first and second choice tally of 42 percent. Biden, on the other hand, is only the second choice for about ten percent of voters, while Sanders about doubles his prospects.

Warren had led hugely against her Democrat contenders in an Iowa Starting Line-Change Research poll from August. In that poll, Warren surged past Biden and Sanders by 11 points, earning nearly 30 percent of support overall.

Since the second Democrat presidential primary debate on September 12, Warren’s Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls leads all other candidates with 23 percent. Biden comes in with 20.3 percent average post-debate in Iowa, while Sanders garners 12 percent.

Warren’s surge in Iowa, though, has been met with confrontation from some farmers in the agricultural state who vehemently oppose the Green New Deal, which she has endorsed. In one conversation, an Iowa farmer confronted Warren over her support for the plan, which he said would cripple his industry because of its goals to eliminate cows.

It’s not just Iowa where Warren is surging. Across the country, Warren has steadily climbed over Biden and Sanders to take the lead.

The latest Civiqs/DataProgress poll conducted this month put Warren at 30 percent with likely Democrat primary voters. Biden fell to second place with 24 percent and Sanders trailed with 14 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll taken in the second week of September, Warren tied with Biden nationally with each taking 26 percent of Democrat primary voters. Sanders, at third, came in at 16 percent.

Even in California, where Biden has led the pack in most statewide polls, Warren took the lead in the latest Change Research poll, getting 25 percent compared to Biden’s 23 percent. At stake in California for 2020 Democrats are about 416 delegates.

Warren’s recent taking the lead in key Democrat primary states and polls has come after embarrassing mishaps in which she formally apologized to Native Americans for spending years claiming to be Native American herself. Those critics, though, have been reluctant to accept her apology, as Breitbart News noted.

The flops on the campaign trail are far from being in the past for Warren. Last week, she exaggerated for the third time the size of her campaign rally crowds. After holding a rally in Washington Square in New York City, the Warren campaign claimed 20,000 people were at the event. New York City Parks confirmed that Washington Square can only hold a maximum of 10,000 people.

Similarly, in August, Warren’s campaign claimed that 12,000 people were in attendance at her rally on the campus of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. The maximum capacity of the venue, though, is about 3,000 people, and with crowd spillover, there could not have been more than 6,000 attendees.

In New Hampshire, Warren’s campaign claimed there were 700 people in attendance at a rally on a farm. Breitbart News was there and judged the crowd at about “over 300.”

Built mostly on the perception of a grassroots populist campaign, Warren’s run for president has seen her take on multinational corporations for outsourcing American jobs and promising an economic patriotist agenda even while using billionaire donor money and pleasing the donor class by taking a mass illegal and legal immigration position.

Despite her anti-establishment messaging, Warren has reportedly been in talks with Democrat Party establishment figures like failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and has received praise from former Senator Harry Reid. One Democrat strategist told NBC News that Clinton has been impressed with Warren’s campaign thus far.

Not so long ago, a United Auto Workers strike against General Motors was a big deal. Of course, not so long ago, General Motors was a big company—in fact, the biggest company in not only the U.S., but in the whole wide world.

Times change, and now the GM strike, which began on September 15, is just a footnote in the news. Or, actually, we should say, it was just small beer, until both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders announced that they would visit the Michigan picket line. Maybe soon, another dozen or so Democrat presidential candidates will show up, too, along with the usual traveling circus of roving reporters, talking heads, and publicity-seeking celebrities.

Yes, times change—and they never stop changing.

Yet even if the GM strike is now firmly in the news, the fact remains that GM today is just a shadow of what it once was. It’s only the 13th-largest company in the U.S. by revenues and the 32nd-largest in the world. And if one measures GM by market capitalization—that is, the total value of its stock—it’s even further back in the pack; its market cap is $54 billion, whereas top-ranked Microsoft is worth $1.06 trillion, or 20 times as much.

For its part, the UAW, too, has shrunk dramatically; its membership has declined by nearly three-fourths over the last four decades, from 1.5 million in 1979 to 400,000 today.

By now, these sorts of statistics—the rise of tech, the decline of manufacturing, including manufacturing employment—have become familiar. Yet still, as a nation, we haven’t yet figured out how to make sure workers get a fair piece of the pie. How are people—with or without unions—going to make a living in the 21st century?

Perhaps we can gain perspective on this question by learning more about how leaders thought about jobs and economic justice in the 20th century. Yes, times and technology have changed, and yet human beings are still human beings. And as American citizens, they have political rights and legitimate needs—and these, as we shall see, have been sorely neglected in recent decades.

When Workers Were Strong—Maybe Too Strong

Let’s go back to November 21, 1945, when the UAW struck GM. That strike was a front-page big deal, with vast national repercussions. For context, we can recall that this strike came just three months after the end of World War II; in the new post-war era, both business and labor, unleashed from most wartime controls, were eager to get back to peacetime manufacturing and working.

So if GM wanted to sell more cars, its workers wanted more pay; specifically, the union wanted a 30 percent raise. GM said “no,” and the strike was on; some 320,000 employees hit the picket lines. (We might note that in those days, the GM strikers represented .56 percent of the nation’s total employment. We can pause to observe that more than half of one percent for just one firm is a lot; by comparison in 2019, the GM strike involves only 48,000 workers, or .003 percent—less than a thirtieth of one percent—of America’s employed today.)

In March 1946, four months after the labor action began, the two sides reached a settlement; GM workers got a 17.5 percent raise.

Yet the GM strike was just an overture; 1945-46 saw a nationwide wave of strikes as electrical workers, meatpackers, steel workers, oil workers, railroad engineers, theatrical craftsmen—4.3 million workers total—went off the job. That was roughly eight percent of the workforce.

Needless to say, all these strikes put a burden on the economy, as well as on the social order. In particular, in those days, as the first chill winds of the Cold War were being felt, J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI had well-founded concerns about communist influence—even outright pro-Soviet activity—within some unions. In the meantime, in addition, evidence abounded of mob influence and hooliganism within some unions.

So the challenge to the nation was serious—that is, balancing the rights of workers alongside the overall public interest in law-abiding prosperity.

This need to find the proper balance meant re-examining a key piece of legislation that had been passed in the New Deal decade of the 1930s, namely, the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act.

The Wagner Act was called the “Magna Carta for labor” for a reason; just as the Magna Carta (Great Charter) back in 1215 had guaranteed rights for Englishman, so, too, did the Wagner Act guarantee rights for labor, including:

The exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.

That is, collective bargaining. Unions.

It’s interesting to recall the breadth of support for the Wagner Act at the time of its passage; back in ’35, in the middle of the Depression, majorities in both parties agreed that something had to be done to empower workers. Thus the U.S. Senate approved the measure by a vote of 63 to 12, with a dozen Republicans joining in support, while the House passed the bill without even bothering with a recorded vote. On July 5, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it into law, describing it “to be necessary as an act of both common justice and economic advance.”

The Wagner Act was broadly popular because it was based on an obvious point: To achieve a fair bargain, both sides in a negotiation need to have bargaining power.

To put that another way, if Big Business was the new economic reality, then labor needed to be big, too. After all, if labor wasn’t strong enough to stand up to business, then business would rule, perhaps in the manner of European fascism.

In other words, as is the risk with any one-sided regime, a lopsided power equation in favor of business could lead to tyranny. And that, in turn, could produce a backlash, some sort of violent revolt. Indeed, it’s worth recalling that in 1935, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was a recent memory; no right-thinking American wanted to see the red tide coming here.

So the Wagner Act was, in reality, a moderate compromise, aimed at fending off radicalism from either the right or the left. Indeed, it echoed the checks and balances written into the Constitution; the whole idea was to guarantee that business would have to bargain with labor. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith would later describe the system as the interplay of “countervailing forces”: Big Business checked by Big Labor—and vice versa.

Harry Truman Confronts the Labor Crisis

As a senator in 1935, Harry Truman had voted for the Wagner Act, and yet now, as president in 1945, he saw that the reform needed reform; labor’s Magna Carta had given the unions too free a rein—and so it was time to rein them in.

In Year of Decisions, the first volume of his memoirs, Truman wrote, “By the autumn of 1945, the labor situation was assuming serious proportions … The increasing labor difficulties of the postwar period were the subject of many discussions with the Cabinet in meetings in October and November.”

This labor unrest was ironic, because, of course, Truman and the Democrats in charge of Congress were generally pro-labor. And yet as we all have discovered, even a good thing is often in need of tinkering—and if necessary, a full overhauling.

Being the energetic man that he was, Truman took action; he invited the leaders of labor and management—including the heads of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Federation of Labor, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations—to meet with him in Washington to “work out a new approach to toward solving the industrial crisis.”

We might pause over those last two words, “industrial crisis.” As Truman further wrote, “The country needed a national wage policy, effective mediation machinery, and other remedial legislation which would protect the rightful interests of labor, of management, and of the public.”

Mindful of these goals, Truman began to formulate a series of reforms to the Wagner Act, such as mandatory cooling off periods and a ban on secondary strikes. He was even willing, if need to be, to send in federal troops to operate trains and mines; Truman was pro-labor, yes, but he was pro-public interest, first.

On November 5, 1945, Truman addressed the assembled leaders of business and labor in the Labor Department’s main auditorium—a bit of signaling there. Yet still, in his speech, the president spoke bluntly to both sides: “Failure to produce any workable recommendations on how to avoid work stoppages would mean legislation by Congress.” In other words, if you guys in the private sector can’t figure this out, elected officials will have to step in.

Unfortunately, the negotiations proved to be just more confrontations; even as they were sitting in the same room together, under the watchful eye of Team Truman, business and labor leaders couldn’t agree on anything important.

Indeed, to Truman’s dismay, the single most difficult figure proved to be a labor man, John L. Lewis, president of the mighty United Mine Workers. In that period, Truman summoned Lewis to the White House on no less than six occasions, warning him that “precipitous strikes” could lead the opposition congressional Republicans pushing “punitive measures against labor.” Indeed, when the mine workers defied a federal court’s back-to-work order, Truman’s Justice Department hauled Lewis himself into court, finding him guilty of civil and criminal contempt.

Beyond his exasperation with Lewis, Truman was concerned that if he and his fellow Democrats couldn’t take labor to the higher ground of constructive compromise, the Republicans would take labor to the abyss of annihilation. That is, whereas Democrats wanted to reform the Wagner Act, many Republicans, grown more militant since the ’30s, were now seeking its outright repeal.

Truman was nothing if not vivid in a letter he wrote to another labor leader on December 11, 1945: “I am going to need all the help and cooperation I can possibly get to keep labor from getting its throat slit in this Congress.” [emphasis added]

Yet in the end, Truman’s mediation efforts, valiant as they were, were not successful. The gap between Big Business and Big Labor was simply too wide to be easily or quickly bridged.

As a result, in November 1946, the opposition Republicans, surfing a wave of outrage against the antics of Lewis and other labor barons, won a smashing victory in the midterm elections. For the first time since 1930, the GOP had control of both chambers of Congress; indeed, it seemed that Truman himself would be a dead duck in the 1948 election.

The centerpiece of the Republican agenda for the 80th Congress, convening in January 1947, was braking, or even breaking, the power of labor.

Thus the Taft-Hartley Act was passed in June 1947; Truman vetoed the legislation, and his veto was overridden, with many Democrats joining in the overriding.

Yet soon after its enactment, Taft-Hartley began causing regrets. If the Wagner Act was seen as too pro-labor, Taft-Hartley was seen as too anti-labor. Seizing on this revised sentiment, and preparing for his own campaign to win a second term in the White House, Truman set about rallying labor and the party of labor, the Democrats, against the anti-labor Republicans. Prominent in the Democrat Party’s 1948 platform: “We advocate the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act.”

Truman had gauged the shifting public sentiment correctly; the Missourian won a smashing comeback victory in 1948. In fact, not only was he victorious, but Democrats also recaptured the House and the Senate. So we can see: The “loyal opposition” in Congress had badly overplayed its hand; the country wanted the New Deal to be reformed, not repealed. (Here at Breitbart News earlier this year, I detailed Truman’s big win, considering ways in which Donald Trump could apply the same sort of anti-“loyal opposition” strategy in 2020.)

The following year, 1949, good to his word, Truman sought the repeal of Taft-Hartley. And yet he failed in his effort, largely because Southern Democrats, representing states where unions were weak, were figuring out that they could gain economically by attracting factories from the unionized North. (Taft-Hartley gave each state the option of being either a “union shop” state, or a “right to work”—that is, anti-union—state.)

Today, the “right to work” movement has spread widely; 27 states—including, amazingly enough, Michigan—have “right to work” laws on their books.

In Truman’s time, the Democrat Party was split between its Northern and Southern wings. And so, thus divided, the House of Labor started to crumble. It’s fair to say that Taft-Hartley doomed mass unionization in the U.S.

When Workers Are Weak—Labor’s Long Slide

So if we’ve seen unions when they were at their peak of optimism—critics would say arrogance—now, we can look at unions in their valley of doubt.

As we have seen, the basic idea behind labor unions is bargaining power—the power of collective bargaining.

Since the Taft-Hartley legislation of 1947, workers and their unions have always had to confront the reality that if they bargain too hard, the company can simply move to a less-expensive right-to-work state. It took a few decades before the full effect of this dynamic became obvious, but by the ’60s and ’70s, it was obvious to all.

Indeed, the percentage of private-sectors workers in unions has fallen from more than a third in the 1950s to less than seven percent today. (And free trade agreements, making it easy for companies relocate out of the U.S. altogether, have only exacerbated this trend.)

As a result, workers are in a weaker position today; they have lost their bargaining power. To be sure, there are plenty of laws on the books concerning working conditions—and plenty of trial lawyers eager to sue over some breach, real or imagined—and yet for most jobs, statutes concerning actual wages that must be paid are scant and inadequate. And that’s why there are so few strikes in the private sector; workers have learned, the hard way, that they must take what the bosses are offering.

Some Painful Numbers for Working People

Moreover, that’s why, according to the Pew Research Center, real wages (that is, adjusted for inflation) for most Americans have stagnated for the last half-century. Yes, it’s true that in many ways, the standard of living is vastly higher than it was in the 1960s, as new inventions have flooded the market, making goods both better and cheaper.

Yet still, some key variables, such as the cost of college and the cost of housing, have skyrocketed, leaving many workers today demonstrably worse off than their predecessors. And in any case, there’s nothing like a big fat paycheck.

The pro-labor Economic Policy Institute (EPI) makes a further point, focusing on the hurtful impact that ebbing bargaining power has had on workers, even as the overall economy has sailed along. According to EPI data, from 1948 to 1979, increases in wages and increases in productivity closely paralleled one another: In those three decades, productivity rose 108 percent, while compensation rose 93 percent. That wasn’t a perfect one-to-one ratio, but it was close enough. And it seemed only fair: If workers were working better, they should be sharing in the gains. And unions were there to make sure that the sharing occurred.

Yet since 1979, according to EPI, productivity and compensation have gone their separate ways: Productivity has risen 69 percent, while compensation has risen just 11 percent. To put it another way, productivity went up more than six times faster than compensation. EPI’s message is clear: In the absence of unions, the gain-sharing imperative on business was also absent.

So where did the added value of those productivity increases go, if not to workers? Short answer: Much of the added value went to corporate investors; that’s one reason why the Dow Jones average sits above 27,000. Indeed, over the last four decades, the stock market is up more than 3,200 percent; by contrast, the federal minimum wage is up 250 percent.

Furthermore, a close look at data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve provides an even more startling look at labor’s long slide. In 1947, the year Taft-Hartley passed, compensation (defined as wages and salary accruals) accounted for 49.4 percent of GDP; that is, workers got a smidge less than half of the national output. Interestingly, the workers’ share of GDP rattled around in a narrow three-point band for the next two decades, never going below 48.8 percent and peaking, in 1969, at 51.6 percent.

Yet then came that long slide in labor incomes. Taft-Hartley obviously played a role, but so, too, did other forces, such as globalization, outsourcing, and mass immigration. By 2011, during the Obama administration, worker compensation as a percentage of GDP had fallen to 42 percent; in the last seven years, it has ticked up slightly, to 43 percent.

Hmm. From 51.6 percent of GDP in 1969 to 43 percent in 2018. Over time, ordinary folks must have noticed that fall in their share of the nation’s wealth. Indeed, now we can start to see why economic populists in decades past—Dick Gephardt in the ’80s, Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan in the ’90s—found such resonance, even if they never reached the White House. It was not until Trump that anyone could put it all together, although the anger had long been smoldering.

So again, who got those shifting 8.6 percentage points of the national wealth? They went to many places, including government, private investment, and the trade deficit. And oh yes, during the same half century, corporate profits rose from about five percent of GDP to ten percent. Yes, you read that right: Much of the change in the national share going to compensation has simply been a shift from workers to corporations—workers down more than eight points and corporate profits up five points. (Of course, it’s also true that wealth to corporations is wealth to shareholders, and many workers are shareholders, either through direct investments, or indirectly, through pension funds. But still, few workers think of themselves as investors; that’s why they call themselves workers—because they can’t rely on their capital to live, and so they have to rely, instead, on their labor.)

If we step back and consider the fate of workers’ wages over the last five decades, 1969 to 2018, we see that the change has been profound; it explains, for example, why the financiers of Manhattan are so rich and the workers of Milwaukee are so hard-pressed. After all, that decline in compensation—again, from the high of 51.6 percent down to 43 percent—amounts to a decline of 8.6 percentage points. For the U.S. economy, that’s more than one dollar in 12.

To put that 8.6-point number another way, since U.S. GDP is $21.3 trillion, 8.6 percent of that is more than $1.8 trillion. So now maybe we can better see why workers have been angry for so long: They’ve been on the losing end of that long slide—in effect, a $1.8 trillion pay cut, just in 2018.

Of course, during this long slide, most Republicans have typically cheered; they might not have even realized the income shift, but they certainly noticed the partisan shift. After all, Big Labor was once the mainstay of the Democrat Party, and so the shrinking of labor has shrunk the Democrats; the party of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson is no longer winning giant landslides in the way that the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the ’30s and ’40s, or that of Lyndon Johnson did in 1964. (Of course, it’s also no longer the party of Jefferson and Jackson—or, for that matter, of FDR and LBJ.)

On the other hand, the new Democrat Party is hardly a weakling; it has won the presidency in four of the last seven elections—and won the national popular vote in six of the last seven. So while it’s true that the Democrats aren’t winning giant landslides anymore, they have proven themselves capable of winning decent-sized landslides. In 1992, for example, Bill Clinton won 370 electoral votes, and in 1996, he won 379. In 2008, Barack Obama won 365, and in 2012, he won 365. In the meantime, no Republican—including Trump—has scored more than any of those electoral-vote totals since 1988.

Moreover, in lesser elections, the Democrats are doing well enough. They boast 54 percent of seats in the House of Representatives, possess 47 percent of seats in the U.S. Senate, and hold 46 percent of governorships—and own as well nearly 100 percent of big-city mayorships.

Yet ominously for the nation, the new Democrat Party has changed: It seems that even Harry Truman-type Democrats have gone away. Truman’s old Senate seat is now held by a Republican, Josh Hawley.

Today’s Democrat Party is mostly free of the influence of industrial union halls, which were once themselves thick with American flags and military veterans.

Instead, today’s Democrats are more in the mold of either Hillary Clinton or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; that is, they are oriented toward de luxe financialism or relentless radicalism—and often embrace both views at the same time.

Indeed, as their center of gravity has shifted from union halls to university campuses, today’s Democrats are ever more likely to delve into exotic isms, going even further afield from lunch-bucket and kitchen-table concerns. (Although, of course, there are plenty of self-declared socialists in the Democrat Party today; so it’s hardly the case that economic concerns have disappeared, even if most Americans rightfully fear a Hugo Chavez-like policy agenda. Socialism, of course, makes Truman-style populism look pretty darn good.)

Still, the leftward ideological transformation of the Democrat Party might be helping the Republicans in some places—it’s getting easier to portray Democrats as “loony left”—and yet it also means that there will be hell to pay when the Democrats next win.

The Party That Works for Workers Will Win with Workers

Of course, in the short run, there’s not much to be done about these changes. What matters more for the right is getting its own house in order, and that requires a franker understanding of who, exactly, is voting Republican these days.

To that end, more Republicans might take a close look at the 2014 manifesto that helped inspire Donald Trump to run for president: Rick Santorum’s Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works.

In addition, majority-minded Republicans might study The Republican Workers Party: How the Trump Victory Drove Everyone Crazy, and Why It Was Just What We Needed, published last year by F. H. Buckley. That phrase, Republican Workers Party, is a keeper.

In this vein of Main Street Republicanism, it was heartening to see the September 17 headline in Politico: “White House intervenes in General Motors strike: The effort would effectively put the White House on the side of the United Auto Workers.” (Yes, the formal UAW structure is still strongly aligned with the Democrats, but as Breitbart News has noted, in 2017 and again in 2019, the actual auto workers are now mostly Republican—although, of course, it’s always possible to make them more Republican.)

Yet of course, if the Democrats, starting with Sanders and Warren, choose, once again, to worry about auto workers and the working class in general—and if they can demonstrate that they’re truly sincere and not just using workers for props—well, who knows what will happen in 2020, and beyond.

In addition, over the long run, if we’re feeling philosophical, we might give ourselves time to think about how America would be different today if labor unions hadn’t been so profoundly sundered by Taft-Hartley, way back in the fateful decade of the ’40s.

That is, what if the Democrats were still following practical-minded middle-of-the-roaders, such as Harry Truman? As we have seen, back in the ’40s, Truman did not succeed in saving the unions from the start of their long slide—but at least he gave it his best shot.

Harry Truman, Meet Your Senatorial Successor, Josh Hawley

And as we think back on Truman, we might also think ahead. We might look, for instance, to the man now sitting in Truman’s Senate seat, Josh Hawley. Just on September 18, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Hawley outlined his vision of standing up for ordinary folks: “If the conservative movement wants to have a future, it’s going to have to commit itself to being the movement of working people. If we do that, if conservatives do that, if there’s a core group that will do that, then the rest of D.C., the lobbyists, they will follow along. It’s going to have to be people-driven change.”

So what, exactly, does Hawley have in mind? How, precisely, is he going to seek to raise the standard of living in Missouri—and everywhere else? Hawley hasn’t yet fleshed out the details, but hey, let’s give him space; he’s only been in the Senate for nine months, and he’s spent most of that time on a worthy mission, namely, taking on Big Tech—and on that subject, he’s provided plenty of details.

Yet even so, he had more to say to Breitbart News, and what he said is encouraging:

We have to stay focused on the issues that actually matter to real people and have to challenge the leadership class. So, as the Democrats turn towards socialism, is that a problem? Yeah, it is, but it just goes to show you that they have no idea how to respond to the needs of working people. We can’t just reject their crazy ideas. We also have to push forward with an agenda that actually benefits what I call the “American middle,” which is the middle of our society, people that really sustain our society. So it’s going to be a pro-worker agenda, it has to get wages up, we have to get manufacturing going again, we have to get healthcare costs down, to get folks new opportunities to get skills and jobs training, break up the monopoly of higher education, and take on the monopolists in the economy and their sweetheart deals with government.

Hawley has his own ideas, and yet we can recognize some Trumanesque themes.

And Truman, let’s not forget, spent nearly eight years in the White House."

Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, discussed the mounting controversy involving former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Ukraine.

Nunes told host Maria Bartiromo he saw it as the end of the elder Biden’s 2020 presidential bid.

“I mean, look, there’s a lot. Look, the left knows that Biden’s son is a problem for him,” he said. “This is why, when Hillary Clinton was running, these stories first originated — first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure that Biden didn’t get in the race.”

“So, now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme,” Nunes continued. “Maybe there really is — this whistle-blower is not a partisan. I mean, we want to — we want to hear from that whistle-blower. But it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And this — like I said, I think this is probably the end of Biden’s campaign.”

“End of his campaign?” Bartiromo replied.

“I really do. I don’t think — I mean, not that he’s — he’s still formidable,” Nunes answered. “He still has a bloc of support. But if you look, his lead is basically down to zero. If you look at what happened in Iowa now, it looks like Elizabeth Warren is in the lead.”

According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, when all American voters are asked to rank 12 policies from best to worst, a plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens — endorsed by Democrat front-runners like Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — ranks as the least popular among the bunch.

The Journal notes:

Of 12 policy ideas tested in the poll, providing government-sponsored health care to undocumented immigrants was the least popular among the broader electorate, with 62% rejecting it. In a June Democratic debate, all 10 candidates on the stage, including Messrs. Biden and Sanders, raised their hands when asked who backed the idea. In the new survey, it was supported by 64% of Democratic primary voters but only 36% of voters overall. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

Similar polls conducted in recent months found that American anywhere between 60 to 63 percent of swing voters oppose offering free healthcare to illegal aliens, as well as 55 to 59 percent of all U.S. voters.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 900 registered voters was conducted between September 13 and 16 with a margin of error of +/- 3.27 percentage points.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) declared over the weekend that former Vice President Joe Biden doesn’t have what it takes to achieve “systemic” social change — yet another indication that his 2020 bid faces heavy skepticism from the Democrat Party’s progressive wing.

“There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,” Omar said in an interview with the Guardian on Saturday. “And I would say he is not one of them.”

“I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t,” she added.

Omar’s criticism of Biden came after delivering a keynote address at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum, an event organized by several progressive organizations, in which she argued the United States needs a president who “realizes we are not just fighting for one election; we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become.”

Several Democrat presidential candidates —including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — attended the gathering.

The far-left “Squad” member is not the only lawmaker in the four-person clique to raise concerns about Biden’s bid for the White House. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an author of the Green New Deal, has repeatedly taken aim at Biden’s climate change proposal for fossil fuels to be eliminated by 2050. However, according to the New York Democrat, the former Veep’s plan is too little, too late.

“Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said. “It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez also previously knocked Biden’s performance at the first Democratic presidential debate, saying it “raised questions” about his capacity to be commander-in-chief.

“I think Joe Biden, his performance on the stage, kind of raised some questions in respect to that,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But I don’t want to say just because someone is 79, they can’t or shouldn’t run for president. I don’t want to… use a number as a proxy for capacity,” she told The New Yorker radio hour in July."

Their participation follows weeks of climate change alarmism from presidential candidates and activists across the globe. Several of the presidential hopefuls have floated limiting beef consumption – particularly, in recent weeks.

Yang told the audience at CNN’s 7-hour climate change town hall this month that “it’s good for the environment, it’s good for your health if you eat less meat.”

“I think it would be healthy on both an individual and a societal level for us to move in that direction,” he said.

Klobuchar also signaled support of reshaping dietary guidelines to reduce beef consumption, as did Harris, who said the government should find the balance between creating incentives and banning “certain behaviors.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Harris said she would support changing the government dietary guidelines and the food pyramid to reduce the amount of red meat in American diets. She also supported the idea of putting climate impact labels on food. “I’ve always believed that we should, you know, expand what’s on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store,” she said. “We should expand the list. And included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for more “balance” in American meat production but was careful to say he was not in favor of abolishing the cow. He argued that government intervention like a carbon tax would encourage Americans have “more balanced diet” and a “more balanced footprint.” … O’Rourke cited a similar solution, arguing that a carbon tax would balance out the carbon emissions by the meat industry. “I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the markets to respond by setting a price on carbon in every single part of our economy, every facet of American life,” he said.

In August, Sanders signaled that he would consider a “meat tax” in order to help combat climate change.

“Germany has imposed a meat tax in hopes of limiting this consumption,” a woman at a Q&A session at a town hall event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, said.

“What are your plans to stop these large corporations from further usurping natural resources and polluting the planet?” she asked.

“Thank you for the question, and it’s a good question. All I can say is if we believe, as I do and you do, that climate change is real, we’re gonna have to tackle it in every area, including agriculture,” Sanders said.

Their participation in the Steak Fry comes one day after Friday’s global climate strike, which several of the candidates adamantly praised:

The DNC is raising both the fundraising threshold as well as the polling standards, making it even more difficult for presidential hopefuls to lay out their vision on the national debate stage in November. In order to qualify, a candidate will have to report at least 165,000 individual donors, up from 130,000. The DNC is also requiring 600 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Candidates will have two ways to qualify for the debate via polling, either receiving five percent support in two early primary and caucus state polls – which includes Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or receiving three percent support in four early primary and caucus state polls or national polls.

While details of the November date are to be determined, any polls released “between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate” will count, the New York Times added, noting that “at least eight candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold.”

Candidates have until October 1 to qualify for next month’s debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. In order to qualify, a candidate must garner at least two percent in four DNC-approved polls and report 130,000 individual donors, up from the 65,000 required for the first debate. Eleven candidates have qualified, including Tom Steyer (D). He will be joined by:

Joe Biden (D)

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)

Julián Castro (D)

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)

Beto O’Rourke (D)

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D)

Andrew Yang (D)

Both Marianne Williamson (D) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) are still vying to get on the October debate stage, needing three polls and two polls, respectively.

The increased threshold is likely to draw critiques from low-tier candidates, who slammed the DNC’s requirements in the past.

“Here’s the situation: there’s a whole bunch of different polls that have come out. The DNC has only recognized some of them as being qualifying polls for the debate,” Gabbard told Tucker Carlson in August.

“The whole thing gets a little bit confusing. You’ve gotta jump way down into the weeds of the numbers and statistics, but I think the bigger problem is that whole process really lacks transparency,” she added.

“The DNC’s process is stifling debate at a time when we need it most,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) declared last month. “And it will NOT help us beat Donald Trump. If we wanted to be the party that excluded people, we’d be Republicans”:

“If the DNC had followed the process they announced in February and kept to the promised 17 [sic] qualifying polls, the lineup of the upcoming third debate might be very different,” Williamson’s communications director Patricia Ewing said prior to the third Democrat debate in Houston, Texas."

In total, about 46,000 United Auto Workers (UAW) members are on strike against GM to ensure new hires are paid higher wages and provided with better healthcare benefits after accepting concessions on these fronts a decade ago.

Last week, union workers were notified that their healthcare payments had been halted by GM because of the strike. Though GM executives have claimed that cutting off healthcare payments for union workers during a strike is standard practice, typically union workers’ healthcare plans continue but the UAW pays the costs.

This time around, though, GM’s cutting off of healthcare payments means union workers will have to re-enroll in their healthcare plans once the strike is over. In the meantime, vision and dental healthcare payments will not be covered during the strike.

In an interview with Payday Report, UAW Local 1005 Chairman Al Tiller explained how GM’s cutting off of healthcare payments for union workers led to one worker’s child going without cancer treatment.

“We’re supposed to have our benefits until the end of the month,” Tiller said. “The company decided they were going to cut them yesterday before the union was ready to take over with our strike fund. We had a couple members sick that couldn’t get treated. We got a member with … kid has cancer, went to get his treatment and couldn’t get it. So we don’t have $10,000 to put down and get reimbursed for it. We’re on strike.”

“They cut our benefits and its affecting our families, our kids,” Tiller continued. “This isn’t a company that cares about people. This is a company that cares about the dollar. And there’s another example right there. They don’t care about this kid with cancer and his treatment, they just want us to pay for it.”

In an op-ed published last week, Patrick Anderson, a 25-year GM employee, said he and his fellow American workers are striking because “we’re done sacrificing.”

Anderson wrote:

[Mary Barra] probably never experienced what my child experienced in my 25 years in the auto industry with GM. Because I have had to work in six plants in three states, my family has moved twice, and my child has changed schools and watched her father worry about what uncertainty was going to come next thanks to GM. I can’t help but think that maybe if her family had to experience what my family has gone through, then maybe she would be handling the workforce decisions differently. [Emphasis added] The fact is that when GM was down, we sacrificed. Now that GM is thriving, the company is trying to hurt us with reduced wages, cuts to health care and fewer benefits. [Emphasis added]

The strike comes as GM CEO Mary Barra idled the 78-year-old Warren Transmission plant, leaving about 335 American workers laid off from their jobs. In the long-run, analysts predict that the plant’s closure will leave 16,000 American workers laid off from their jobs in the region.

The Warren, Michigan layoffs came after 1,600 American workers were laid off in Lordstown, Ohio, where GM idled their assembly plant. That plant’s closure, alone, could leave more than 8,000 Americans in supporting industries in the area laid off.

Meanwhile, Barra continues earning about $22 million a year — a less than half a percent pay cut despite mass layoffs in the U.S. GM made more than $8 billion in profits last year after taxes.

As Breitbart News’ John Carney noted, the UAW strike against GM is just one component of growing signs that economic power is increasingly in the hands of employees rather than employers in President Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” economy.

The actor-activist hosted the LGBTQ presidential forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday, which featured all of the Democrat presidential candidates except Sanders.

The 38-year-old star spoke to the Guardian following the forum and criticized Sanders for skipping the event.

“I was disappointed to not see all of the candidates here. I was further disappointed to hear this was not the only LGBTQ event Bernie was making other commitments for,” Ross said. “You don’t show up for both of our LGBTQ events? That’s obviously telling us all we need to know.”

The Pose actor claimed access to inside information, which purportedly revealed that Sanders’ prior commitments included visiting historically black colleges and universities as well as an “old black barbershop”:

I’m going to risk being super real here for a second. When you’re on the campaign trail, what’s happening a lot – and what a lot of these candidates have to avoid – is being seen as looking for a photo op. To be seen in certain communities and spaces. I heard that he was not only visiting the [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but also visiting an old black barbershop.

“Found out Bernie has a prior commitments to visit HBCUs in North Carolina and Prestige Barber College (a black barbershop) and will be touring the civil rights museum,” Ross tweeted last week, alongside a sarcastic GIF of The Office’s Michael Scott:

Ross told the Guardian that it is a struggle to “get folks in my own black community to understand that being black and being LGBTQ are not mutally exclusive”:

What I hope Bernie would learn is you don’t have to pander to just one aspect of the black community. If he would have been at the LGBTQ forum tonight, he would have seen we were talking about issues affecting people of color. I think it was a huge misstep on his part. And I’m not here for any of the excuses. I say: ‘Make it up to me. Make it up to us.'”

Several social media users disagreed with the former model’s critique of Sanders.

“To question Bernie Sanders stance on lgbtq rights is the most ridiculous thing ever and shows your bias against him,” one user wrote.

“I don’t think he skipped this forum because he doesn’t believe in equal rights for all,” another said.

“Except you decided to focus on one candidate who has the most robust background on this issue. Also, he was at a HBCU which was already scheduled. To think sanders is weak on LGBTQ is frankly laughable,” another added.

The backlash continued to escalate, leading Ross to announce a break from social media “for a while.”

This would not be the first time Sanders has experienced accusations of harassment and intimidation related to his supporters. Black leaders signed a letter last week, which detailed alleged “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. The alleged harassment followed the socialist senator’s loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement.

As Breitbart News reported:

A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter. … The leaders continued, demanding the Sanders campaign “unequivocally denounce the racism in its ranks, and issue a public statement separating themselves from these abhorrent attacks.” They also urged Democrats across the board – both Sanders supporters and Warren supporters – to come together to “defeat one of the most serious threats to peace and justice in our lifetimes.” “We cannot wait to make justice real amongst the resisters — our lives literally depend on each other,” the leaders added in the letter.

Sanders followed up with a tweet, which read, “This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space. We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House.”

But off-field distractions were soon forgotten at the City of Toyota Stadium as Warren Gatland's side quickly stormed into an unassailable lead.

Jonathan Davies settled any early nerves the Welsh players might have had by cutting through the Georgian defense with ease to register an early try between the posts, a sure sign of things to come.

Georgia, ranked 12th in the world, barely touched the ball in the opening stages with Wales seemingly able to extend its lead at will.

Elizabeth Warren is now at the top tier of the 2020 field in the crucial Iowa caucuses. That notion drastically undersells how strong a position Warren is actually in.

Yes, Warren tops the field in the CNN-DMR poll with 22% support, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden at 20% (the poll has a four-point margin of error, putting the two essentially in a tie). Warren and Biden are followed distantly by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 11%.

But that doesn't tell the whole story: The topline numbers are actually the least good thing for Warren in the poll.

Consider this:

* Warren gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

* Her favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is behind her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

* Warren is the first or second choice of 42% of those polled. That's well in front of Biden (30% first/second combined), Sanders (21%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (16%).

Any one of those three data points would suggest that this poll may have only caught the start of Warren's rise in Iowa. All three together suggest she is well positioned to take off like a rocket ship in the state. Not only does she already have a broad-base of support in the state (as evidence by the topline numbers) but she also has significant passion among those who are for her and remains well-liked -- and a possible voting option -- for those who say she is their second choice at the moment.

That's not even taking into account Warren's grassroots operation, which is widely regarded as the best -- by a lot -- of any campaign in Iowa. Wrote the Des Moines Register on Sunday:

""Elizabeth Warren's slow but steady rise in the first-in-the-nation caucus state is as much a result of her robust organizational presence here as it is a response to the Massachusetts senator's many plans and policies, Iowa experts say ... the (poll) results were not surprising, said several Iowa Democrats who have watched Warren build out a team that is widely credited with having the most sophisticated organizational presence in the state.""

Add it all up and you get this: With 133 days left before the February 3 caucuses, Warren is the clear Iowa front-runner. There's simply no one else who can make anywhere near as strong a case -- either by polling or staff or both -- as Warren in the state.

Now, OF COURSE, 133 days is a long time in politics. Things can change. If past is prologue, there will be a handful of up and downs within the top tier between now and February 3. But it's very clear from the polling trends that Iowa is now Warren's to lose."

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden lead the Democratic field in New Hampshire, with 27% and 25% support respectively, according to a new poll of likely Democratic primary voters from Monmouth University on Tuesday.

In a close race for third place, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received 12% in the poll, followed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 10%.

This is the fourth qualifying poll to show Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard with 2% support or higher, meaning she has now met both the polling and fundraising requirements to join the other 11 candidates who have qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

California Sen. Kamala Harris got 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang received 2% each. All other candidates received 1% or less in the New Hampshire poll.

In July, CNN's poll with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.

Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.

Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.

Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).

But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.

Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 17 to 21, 2019 with 401 New Hampshire voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2020. Results among likely Democratic primary voters have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points."

In a rare strategy memo sent as part of a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday morning, Warren's campaign manager, Roger Lau , announced an eight-figure TV and digital campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

The memo shared three examples of ads, all featuring the theme of rooting out corruption, that the campaign plans to launch, though it did not clarify which of the three would run online, on television or both, and exactly when the ads would begin to air.

Lau noted that the campaign's biggest expense at the moment is staff but said he expects that to soon become media spending, with a bigger bulk of the expenditure going towards digital ads than TV.

""At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election -- by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,"" Lau wrote. ""As we head into the fall, here's how we'll build on our progress, build out our team, and keep growing the movement that will elect Elizabeth and elect Democrats up and down the ballot next November.""

As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The gold standard poll in Iowa showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.

The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission that he might have no path forward.

Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.

""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""

Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.

But Biden was also insistent that the focus should remain on Trump improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son.

""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""

But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.

He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.

Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""

Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""

""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.

In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.

The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.

That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.

Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.

""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.

Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.

Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers.

Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.

Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.

The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.

Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.

As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.

Harris' campaign has mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.

O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.

""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""

""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.

He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.

His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.

Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.

At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""

Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so.

He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""

""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said."

Omar's office confirmed the comments to CNN.

In a tweet, Romney, who was his party's presidential nominee in 2012, also said it was ""critical"" for the facts surrounding the call to emerge.

""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,"" Romney, who represents Utah, wrote in the tweet.

The comments from the prominent GOP senator are some of the strongest to come from his party, whose members have largely remained silent following news last week that a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General was concerned in part with a July 25 call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday, after Trump acknowledged that he discussed Biden during the call but maintained that the conversation was ""warm and friendly,"" congressional Democrats urged an investigation into the matter, with some calling for Trump's impeachment.

CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

She has worked on three Republican presidential campaigns and is an adjunct professor at George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs. She is a graduate of Harvard Law School. The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee just announced the debate criteria for November. As expected, it has modestly raised the bar again, asking for candidates to meet a slightly higher polling and donor threshold than the last debates. But like my elderly cat when we got a slightly taller box spring, some candidates just can't make the leap.

And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced to adjust their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks are excluding highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are complaining the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races.

But first, let's be clear that Democratic primary voters want to narrow the field. Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while disadvantaging others (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.

The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes tossed around not-so-veiled references to the size of their penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.

Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee.

And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a reflection of name recognition among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud.

It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.

Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be down to eight

But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a polling average of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.

So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:

The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.

Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?

Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages here. But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate (Biden). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more?

These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden in 2007 (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).

And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs.

But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.

Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"

Many strikes are over quickly. In 2007, the last national strike against GM lasted only a few days. Another UAW strike against Chrysler that year was resolved in a matter of hours. To protect its strike fund, the UAW doesn't start parceling out strike benefits to members until Day 8.

The strike benefits will cost the union about $12.5 million a week. The UAW is also paying for members' health insurance during the strike, making Cobra payments on their behalf. The union had nearly $800 million in its strike fund at the end of last year, meaning that it could go about a year paying strike benefits before it would deplete the fund. The fund is built up over time by UAW member dues, which can come to about 2-1/2 hours pay per month.

Negotiators from the union andwere back at it on Monday morning, after holding talks throughout the weekend. The two sides report making some progress but say they remain far apart on many key issues. The strike began in the early hours of Monday, September 16.

The union is pressing the company to agree to relocate some vehicles built at plants in Mexico to the two US assembly plants that are slated to close. The union said GM builds far more vehicles in Mexico than rivalsof

GM said it has put forward ""solutions"" for the two plants — in Lordstown, Ohio and Detroit — and is offering to invest $7 billion in its American operations to create or keep 5,400 hourly jobs. A person familiar with the company's offer said it is proposing to build an electric truck in the Detroit plant and lithium batteries for electric vehicles in Lordstown. But that work probably wouldn't begin for several years, meaning the plants would be dark until then.

GM announced plans to close those facilities , as well as transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore in November. The four plants employed about 3,000 hourly workers when those closings were announced. GM said it has found other jobs for about 2,300 of those workers, but many people had to relocate.

The union and company are also reportedly still not in agreement on GM's use of temporary hourly workers, as well as about wages and benefits.

The strike is the longest national strike against GM in more than 20 years, one or two plants have been the target of longer strikes in the past. This strike has shut all of GM's 31 US factories spread across nine states, mostly in the center of the country, as well as 21 other facilities, idling nearly 50,000 hourly workers. It is the largest strike against a private sector business since the 2007 strike against GM.

The $250 benefits are much less than the pay that union members are losing because of the strike. GM says that hourly workers earn an average of $90,000 a year, although that includes profit sharing and overtime. To qualify for the strike pay, workers must walk the picket line or do other things related to the strike.

The strike benefits also are subject to income tax. The union will issue 1099 forms to members if their benefits cross the $600 mark.

There is pressure on GM to reach a settlement sooner rather than later. Moody's credit rating agency has said that if the strike goes on for more than one-to-two weeks, ""the financial burden of a strike will become more material."" That could be bad news for GM since it's credit rating rating is currently only one step above junk bond status . If it was downgraded into junk bond status, it could raise the cost of its borrowing in the future.

GM's debt was downgraded into junk bond status in 2005, several years before it ended up in bankruptcy court and in need of a federal bailout in 2009. It took until 2013 for it to shake that rating, and have its debt classified as ""investment grade.""

-- Update: This story has been updated to better reflect what Moody's credit rating statement could mean for GM.

-- Correction: An earlier version of the headline incorrectly stated how much the strikers will get paid from the UAW strike fund."

Warren’s renewed call for impeachment follows reports of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) holding a 4 p.m. Democrat caucus meeting on Tuesday to discuss impeachment. While Pelosi has been hesitant to pursue the matter – telling Democrats during a caucus-wide call in August the public, “isn’t there on impeachment” – her Democrat colleagues appear to be using the alleged “whistleblower” case to push the inquiry, as the Mueller investigation turned out to be a bust:

The alleged whistleblower, who did not even directly hear the purported conversations from Ukrainian leaders, claimed the president urged officials to reopen inquiries into Hunter Biden’s business dealings. As Breitbart News reported, “it is not clear what law, if any, Trump would have broken by urging the Ukrainian government to re-open the case.”

While estimates slightly vary, Democrats are short of a pro-impeachment majority in the House, with 175 in support out of the 235 member caucus. Democrats need 218 votes in the House to make it a reality. Even so, the inquiry would likely flop in the Republican-led Senate, requiring a two-thirds majority – or 67 senators – to vote in favor of impeaching the president.

Warren has increased her calls for impeachment in recent days, arguing that Congress should have taken swift action following the release of the Mueller report, despite the former special counsel not finding any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.

“After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,” Warren wrote last Friday.

“By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president,” she continued, accusing Trump of continuing to commit crimes:

A president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won’t either. Today’s news confirmed he thinks he’s above the law. If we do nothing, he’ll be right. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 20, 2019

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is surging in the polls, particularly in the Midwest.

The focus group, conducted by Engagious/Focus Pointe Global and reported by Axios, included “included 7 women who flipped from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, and 2 who switched from Mitt Romney to Hillary Clinton.”

As Axios noted, while the focus group preferred Warren’s policies, they were put off by her personality.

While some described Warren as “nice,” and “confident,” they did not feel stirred by her or passionate about her.

“I like what she had to say but I still think she’s a sorry bitch,” one said. “I just — the way she acts, and some of the things — I just don’t care for her.”

Another disagreed with the use of the word “bitch” but said Warren said sounded “fake,” even if her ideas were good.

Warren has struggled to convince even her own voters of her electability. At a town hall meeting last month in Franconia, New Hampshire — the first to spark national attention to the growing size of Warren’s crowds — one attendee told Breitbart News that while she liked Warren, she could not see her beating President Donald Trump.

Though the Engagious/FPG data is accompanied by a warning that it is not a statistically representative sample, the information provides clues about what messages are currently resonating with the Democratic electorate.

Axios reports that the results “reflected the doubts that some people have about women in leadership,” but seven of the nine women said they did not know anyone who refused to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because of her gender. Six said that they would vote for Trump if the presidential election were to be held again tomorrow.

Two-thirds (six of nine) also said that it was worth some economic pain to fight China for fairer terms of trade.

A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll came to a slightly different conclusion — namely, that voters nationwide did not like Trump’s personality, but were also skeptical of the left-wing policies being offered by most Democrats.

Wisconsin was a key to Trump’s victory in 2016; Clinton avoided campaigning there, while Trump made several visits to the state in the last days of the election. Democrats will hold their 2020 convention in Milwaukee.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared herself vindicated for being less than two percent Native American, the former Harvard University professor is leading in multiple state and national polls for the 2020 Democrat nomination for president.

In the most recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll out of Iowa, Warren took the lead with 22 percent of Democrat primary voters for the first time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, fell to second place with 20 percent, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) trailed in third with 11 percent.

When Democrat primary voters were asked who their second choice for president would be, Warren gained 20 percent of voters for a combined first and second choice tally of 42 percent. Biden, on the other hand, is only the second choice for about ten percent of voters, while Sanders about doubles his prospects.

Warren had led hugely against her Democrat contenders in an Iowa Starting Line-Change Research poll from August. In that poll, Warren surged past Biden and Sanders by 11 points, earning nearly 30 percent of support overall.

Since the second Democrat presidential primary debate on September 12, Warren’s Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls leads all other candidates with 23 percent. Biden comes in with 20.3 percent average post-debate in Iowa, while Sanders garners 12 percent.

Warren’s surge in Iowa, though, has been met with confrontation from some farmers in the agricultural state who vehemently oppose the Green New Deal, which she has endorsed. In one conversation, an Iowa farmer confronted Warren over her support for the plan, which he said would cripple his industry because of its goals to eliminate cows.

It’s not just Iowa where Warren is surging. Across the country, Warren has steadily climbed over Biden and Sanders to take the lead.

The latest Civiqs/DataProgress poll conducted this month put Warren at 30 percent with likely Democrat primary voters. Biden fell to second place with 24 percent and Sanders trailed with 14 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll taken in the second week of September, Warren tied with Biden nationally with each taking 26 percent of Democrat primary voters. Sanders, at third, came in at 16 percent.

Even in California, where Biden has led the pack in most statewide polls, Warren took the lead in the latest Change Research poll, getting 25 percent compared to Biden’s 23 percent. At stake in California for 2020 Democrats are about 416 delegates.

Warren’s recent taking the lead in key Democrat primary states and polls has come after embarrassing mishaps in which she formally apologized to Native Americans for spending years claiming to be Native American herself. Those critics, though, have been reluctant to accept her apology, as Breitbart News noted.

The flops on the campaign trail are far from being in the past for Warren. Last week, she exaggerated for the third time the size of her campaign rally crowds. After holding a rally in Washington Square in New York City, the Warren campaign claimed 20,000 people were at the event. New York City Parks confirmed that Washington Square can only hold a maximum of 10,000 people.

Similarly, in August, Warren’s campaign claimed that 12,000 people were in attendance at her rally on the campus of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. The maximum capacity of the venue, though, is about 3,000 people, and with crowd spillover, there could not have been more than 6,000 attendees.

In New Hampshire, Warren’s campaign claimed there were 700 people in attendance at a rally on a farm. Breitbart News was there and judged the crowd at about “over 300.”

Built mostly on the perception of a grassroots populist campaign, Warren’s run for president has seen her take on multinational corporations for outsourcing American jobs and promising an economic patriotist agenda even while using billionaire donor money and pleasing the donor class by taking a mass illegal and legal immigration position.

Despite her anti-establishment messaging, Warren has reportedly been in talks with Democrat Party establishment figures like failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and has received praise from former Senator Harry Reid. One Democrat strategist told NBC News that Clinton has been impressed with Warren’s campaign thus far.

The next debate, co-hosted by the New York Times and CNN, is scheduled for October 15th in Westerville, Ohio.

News of Gabbard’s inclusion in the fourth debate comes one day after the DNC announced intensified requirements for candidates to clinch a spot at the fifth debate in November.

Many Americans are frightened by the left-wing vision promoted by Democrats, said Olsen.

“I think it’s clear that a lot of [Democrat] policies — and particularly the stridency with which they are promoted — scare a lot of people, even the people who don’t like President Trump,” assessed Olsen.

LISTEN:



Olsen continued, “[Full-wokeness] would mobilize every Trump supporter to make sure they get out and vote, because the combination of economic policies and the cultural stridency unites every wing of the Trump coalition.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) record of supporting “full-woke” positions will become a political liability in a presidential election, determined Olsen.

“I have a hard time seeing how Warren can avoid that,” speculated Olsen. “She might want to campaign on the economy, but on the other hand, she’s already gone full-woke. She’s already called for reparations. She’s already said that the border should be decriminalized, [and] that there should be no such thing as illegal immigration. She’s already embraced radical positions on abortion.”

Olsen added, “It’s very hard to see how [Elizabeth Warren] avoids talking about that, because you know that the president and Republicans will remind her over and over and over again. I think she’s already stepped into that, so to speak, and it’s going to be hard for her to extricate herself.”

Trump’s greatest political threat is from a Democrat nominee who escapes “full-wokeness,” said Olsen.

“The most formidable opponent [for Donald Trump] is anyone who doesn’t scare the middle,” Olsen stated. “Right now, [Joe Biden] is avoiding full-wokeness. He’s talking about things in a way where he goes part of the way, but he doesn’t go all the way there.”

Joe Biden may move further left over the course of the Democrats’ presidential nomination process, noted Olsen.

“It’s not clear that the Biden we’re seeing now is the Biden we’re going to see in February,” Olsen said. “Will he move left — and sharply left — to get himself the nomination? I don’t know. And I think that if Biden does, then that — plus his notable penchant for gaffes and his obvious inability to maintain a steady debate performance across an entire two hours — will eventually be questions that voters will consider.”

Mansour highlighted a recent focus group of female swing voters examining Warren’s political appeal, inviting Olsen’s analysis on the Massachusetts senator’s likability.

Warren’s “demeanor,” arraigned Olsen, is unappealing to a broad swathe of the electorate.

“I’ve been watching the Democratic debates, and the thing that strikes me — as a former graduate of a well-ranked law school — is how much she reminds me of what she actually is, which is a law professor,” Olsen expressed.

Olsen continued, “The same demeanor of ‘the professor’s always right,’ staring straight out as if you were looking at a class with 200 students in it, and conducting the sort of pointed discussion that really doesn’t admit of discussion.”

Olsen went on, “Unfortunately, the election is not a classroom where students have to agree with you or be quiet. … In an election, people decide whether or not they like the person at the front of the room, and it doesn’t surprise me that a lot of people who don’t already agree with her positions — not just the populist positions, but the whole demeanor of ‘everything is awful and needs to be thrown upside down’ — [don’t] find her terribly attractive, particularly people who don’t have college degrees.”

According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, when all American voters are asked to rank 12 policies from best to worst, a plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens — endorsed by Democrat front-runners like Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — ranks as the least popular among the bunch.

The Journal notes:

Of 12 policy ideas tested in the poll, providing government-sponsored health care to undocumented immigrants was the least popular among the broader electorate, with 62% rejecting it. In a June Democratic debate, all 10 candidates on the stage, including Messrs. Biden and Sanders, raised their hands when asked who backed the idea. In the new survey, it was supported by 64% of Democratic primary voters but only 36% of voters overall. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

Similar polls conducted in recent months found that American anywhere between 60 to 63 percent of swing voters oppose offering free healthcare to illegal aliens, as well as 55 to 59 percent of all U.S. voters.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 900 registered voters was conducted between September 13 and 16 with a margin of error of +/- 3.27 percentage points.

“There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,” Omar said in an interview with the Guardian on Saturday. “And I would say he is not one of them.”

“I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t,” she added.

Omar’s criticism of Biden came after delivering a keynote address at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum, an event organized by several progressive organizations, in which she argued the United States needs a president who “realizes we are not just fighting for one election; we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become.”

Several Democrat presidential candidates —including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — attended the gathering.

The far-left “Squad” member is not the only lawmaker in the four-person clique to raise concerns about Biden’s bid for the White House. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an author of the Green New Deal, has repeatedly taken aim at Biden’s climate change proposal for fossil fuels to be eliminated by 2050. However, according to the New York Democrat, the former Veep’s plan is too little, too late.

“Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said. “It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez also previously knocked Biden’s performance at the first Democratic presidential debate, saying it “raised questions” about his capacity to be commander-in-chief.

“I think Joe Biden, his performance on the stage, kind of raised some questions in respect to that,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But I don’t want to say just because someone is 79, they can’t or shouldn’t run for president. I don’t want to… use a number as a proxy for capacity,” she told The New Yorker radio hour in July."

The DNC is raising both the fundraising threshold as well as the polling standards, making it even more difficult for presidential hopefuls to lay out their vision on the national debate stage in November. In order to qualify, a candidate will have to report at least 165,000 individual donors, up from 130,000. The DNC is also requiring 600 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Candidates will have two ways to qualify for the debate via polling, either receiving five percent support in two early primary and caucus state polls – which includes Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or receiving three percent support in four early primary and caucus state polls or national polls.

While details of the November date are to be determined, any polls released “between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate” will count, the New York Times added, noting that “at least eight candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold.”

Candidates have until October 1 to qualify for next month’s debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. In order to qualify, a candidate must garner at least two percent in four DNC-approved polls and report 130,000 individual donors, up from the 65,000 required for the first debate. Eleven candidates have qualified, including Tom Steyer (D). He will be joined by:

Joe Biden (D)

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)

Julián Castro (D)

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)

Beto O’Rourke (D)

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D)

Andrew Yang (D)

Both Marianne Williamson (D) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) are still vying to get on the October debate stage, needing three polls and two polls, respectively.

The increased threshold is likely to draw critiques from low-tier candidates, who slammed the DNC’s requirements in the past.

“Here’s the situation: there’s a whole bunch of different polls that have come out. The DNC has only recognized some of them as being qualifying polls for the debate,” Gabbard told Tucker Carlson in August.

“The whole thing gets a little bit confusing. You’ve gotta jump way down into the weeds of the numbers and statistics, but I think the bigger problem is that whole process really lacks transparency,” she added.

“The DNC’s process is stifling debate at a time when we need it most,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) declared last month. “And it will NOT help us beat Donald Trump. If we wanted to be the party that excluded people, we’d be Republicans”:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) declared on Tuesday that “billionaires should not exist” as part of the rollout of his massive proposal to redistribute wealth in America via an “extreme wealth” tax, which he claims will “reduce the outrageous level of inequality that exists in America today.”

Sanders unveiled his plan to redistribute wealth in the U.S. via an “extreme wealth tax,” which the socialist senator says will apply to the “top 0.1 percent.” While Sanders’ plan is reminiscent of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) proposed wealth tax, it goes even further, taxing more individuals at even higher rates.

For example, Sanders proposes to implement a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million. The percentage increases alongside the value of assets:

The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.

“These brackets are halved for singles,” Sanders explains.

The socialist senator admits the goal of his ultra-progressive redistribution proposal, boasting that — under his plan — the wealth of billionaires “would be cut in half over 15 years” and declaring that “billionaires should not exist”:

Billionaires should not exist. https://t.co/hgR6CeFvLa — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

There is no justice when three billionaires are able to own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire country. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people. Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Sanders’ proposal would also spur the creation of a “national wealth registry” and provide an “increase in IRS funding” in order to manage a swell of new audits.

It states:

In order to ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax, the proposal includes a number of key enforcement policies. First, it would create a national wealth registry and significant additional third party reporting requirements. Second, it includes an increase in IRS funding for enforcement and requires the IRS to perform an audit of 30 percent of wealth tax returns for those in the 1 percent bracket and a 100 percent audit rate for all billionaires. Third, the wealth tax includes a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and 60 percent over $1 billion for all wealthy individual seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax. Finally, the wealth tax proposal will include enhancements to the international tax enforcement and anti-money laundering regime including the strengthening of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.

The presidential candidate argues the U.S. already taxes inherited wealth via the estate tax and says his proposal is constitutional, citing two Yale law professors, Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, who have expressed support for the radical concept. Sanders adds that it is “not radical” to ask the wealthy to “pay their fair share.”

His proposal is expected to result in $4.5 trillion over the next decade, according to University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Nonetheless, that number does not come close to paying for his expansive, expensive proposals, such as his $16 trillion Green New Deal proposal or Medicare for All, which could — by some estimates — cost the U.S. over $60 trillion over the next decade alone.

Sanders’ ideological ally, Warren, has also introduced a wealth tax, although it does not go as far. She proposes implementing a two percent wealth tax on those with $50 million in assets, as opposed to Sanders’ $32 million. Warren’s plan increases the tax to three percent for those with assets of $1 billion or greater, with no distinction between couples or single filers. She, like Sanders, plans to fund her costly proposals via the wealth tax, although Saez and Zucman estimate that her proposal would result in $2.6 trillion over the next decade, $1.9 trillion less than Sanders’ proposal.

“If we make the top 0.1% pay their fair share in taxes, their quality of life would not change at all,” Sanders tweeted following the announcement of his redistribution scheme.

“But we would be able to invest in housing, child care and health care and improve the lives of millions of working people,” he added:"

Some speculate that Pelosi will use accusations from the alleged “whistleblower” – who claimed Trump urged Urkanian officials to “re-open inquiries into the business dealings of former president Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden” – as a basis to present an impeachment resolution, although the Washington Post reports that Pelosi is “discussing the creation of a select committee to conduct the possible impeachment of President Trump”:

With zero legislative accomplishments since retaking the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, after nearly a year filled with contentious investigations, hearings, and the coming opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats are betting it all on a quixotic mission to try to take out Trump with impeachment.

A problem they face is that they need 218 votes to pass articles of impeachment out of the House, and an even-steeper 67-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate to convict and remove the president from office. At this stage, Democrats do not even have 218 votes despite their 235-seat majority–they are somewhere, at best for the pro-impeachment crowd, somewhere around 175 pro-impeachment votes but with growing momentum. In the Senate, there is next to zero chance that 20 Republicans would join all 47 Democrats to vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges.

But Democrats, after failing to take on major legislative issues like infrastructure, healthcare, paid family leave, or anything else for that matter, are now pushing forward with opening official impeachment proceedings against Trump.

Via @mikedebonis and @rachaelmbade, Pelosi is now ""discussing the creation of a select committee to conduct the possible impeachment of President Trump.” https://t.co/PIxMZZeDzt — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 24, 2019

A House Democrat tells me it's ""very likely"" that Pelosi will announce a formal impeachment inquiry this afternoon and signal her own support for impeachment. — Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 24, 2019

The Democrats spent all year conducting hearings and investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, only to fail–as the Special Counsel Robert Mueller probe also failed–to find any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between Trump and his campaign and the Russians. Mueller’s investigation and the Democrat-led investigations also failed to uncover evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump, leaving Democrats empty-handed heading into the August recess back in July.

But now, after the emergence of complaints by a supposed “whistleblower” against Trump with regard to a conversation he had with Ukraine’s newly-elected leader about former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the Eastern European NATO ally nation, Democrats have reinvigorated their push for impeachment. They are buoyed by a swelling of support from members in key battleground House districts and renewed energy from top Democrats in leadership, including in particular House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly told her friends that she views impeachment as inevitable now.

It remains unclear exactly what the Democrats would be impeaching Trump for. The content of the supposed “whistleblower” complaint about Trump’s call with Ukraine’s new president Volodymyr Zelensky remains private, as does the transcript of the call. The president has said he is considering releasing the call transcript, but has not done so yet–and he expressed concerns that releasing a call transcript could produce a chilling effect among world leaders who wish to have honest and frank conversations with the president of the United States.

But on Tuesday afternoon, after news broke that Pelosi was moving forward with impeachment, Trump announced via Twitter he has ordered the release of the call transcript in full:

I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

….You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

What’s more, the supposed “whistleblower” technically does not qualify as a whistleblower under the federal law that provides protection to such individuals, despite the media and leftists referring to the person as such, and the person apparently did not even bear witness to the call itself. Even if Trump did what was alleged, it is unclear how that would amount to an illegal act worthy of impeachment and conviction of a U.S. president, as several Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have said.

Nonetheless, impeachment is less of a legal question and more of a political matter. Polling shows impeaching Trump remains very unpopular nationwide, and with 31 Democrats sitting in districts in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016–13 of which he won by more than six percent–with even more than that filling out a broader ring of vulnerable members nearing 50, Democrats could imperil their chances of holding their majority if they go through with this process.

To hit the threshold necessary to impeach Trump–218 votes–Pelosi would need to force several self-portrayed “moderate” Democrats in these approximately 50 battleground districts to support impeachment by voting for it. That prospect, getting these Democrats who go home to the district and campaign on doing things to help their constituents–to actually vote for anti-Trump craze mania has Republicans nationally salivating.

Pelosi has held off the left side of her conference all year on impeachment, arguing it would be a perilous political mission that would endanger Democrats and embolden Trump. But with the rise of the so-called “Squad” led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a New York socialist, Pelosi has allowed the growth of these rising leftist forces in her conference all year, to the point where Ocasi0-Cortez has taken the driver’s seat in pushing the party’s agenda, the other side of the Democrat conference be damned.

Over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez ripped Democrats for holding back on impeachment–ginning up the left side of the conference, firing up the Democrat base, and forcing Pelosi into action:

At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior – it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It’s another to let him. The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It‘s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

Now that Pelosi has jumped at the behest of the 29-year-old socialist freshman from New York and her fellow “Squad” members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ocasio-Cortez is ripping Pelosi for only doing a committee–saying she wants instead a straight-up impeachment vote.

Yes, this is an emergency. We don’t have the luxury of time w/ another committee. Judiciary has been investigating& putting the pieces together for months. Impeachment belongs there. We must honor jurisdiction, historical precedent,& work done + allow Judiciary to move forward. https://t.co/CM0gXN7T1i — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 24, 2019

The complexity of how to structure impeachment proceedings is meaningless in the broader scheme of things politically, Republicans argue, because now in the GOP’s view the Democrat Party–and all of its members–have officially jumped the shark by going for broke on Trump impeachment, facts be damned.

Two supposedly “moderate” New York Democrats who joined the impeachment brigade this week, Reps. Antonio Delgado (D-NY) and Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), are already under fire back home in their district as Empire State Republicans hammer away at them for siding with the lunacy of Ocasio-Cortez.

New York GOP chairman Nick Langworthy said in a statement:

By joining the impeachment mob, Antonio Delgado and Sean Patrick Maloney just abandoned their constituents in favor of AOC and the Squad. The radical left’s endless obsession with trying to take out President Trump and derail his agenda will be rejected by the voters who want their representatives to focus on making their lives better, not their own power. This reckless decision will rightfully go down as the one that cost them their seats.

They are hardly alone. Two Virginia Democrat freshman women, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Elaine Luria (D-VA)–both freshman Democrats representing battleground House districts who co-signed an op-ed with five others nationwide in the Washington Post on Monday evening signaling their openness to impeaching Trump–are under fire in Virginia now for abandoning their constituents in favor of impeachment.

“Both Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger were already critically endangered heading into 2020, by publicly joining the left-wing impeachment jihad they are clearly angling for post-Elected office job opportunities,” John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “The Republican Party of Virginia already has field staff on the ground this year in preparation for 2020 and will only be expanding our presence as next November approaches.”

Another co-signer of their op-ed, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA)–a freshman Democrat who represents Pennsylvania’s sixth congressional district, another battleground–is facing criticism already for siding with the radical efforts to impeach Trump while not delivering on substantive policy matters.

“Representative Chrissy Houlahan has gone Washington as she continues to prove that she cares more about partisan politics than finding solutions to the challenges we face here in Pennsylvania,” John Emmons, a conservative businessman running for the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania’s sixth district for the shot to take on Houlahan next November, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “She’d rather go after the President and try to get onto CNN than get to work for the people of her district. The voters of PA-06 deserve so much better out of their Member of Congress.”

Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), a freshman who co-signed the op-ed and represents a battleground district in Colorado after defeating a GOP incumbent in 2018, took a hit in Colorado for signing onto impeachment.

“From his call for impeachment to his extreme voting record, Jason Crow has put his constituents on the backburner and placed his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of working people,” Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli told Breitbart News. “Colorado’s 6th district won’t forget how Crow sided with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi over them.”

In Michigan, one of the op-ed’s cosigners, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and another fellow freshman Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), joined the impeachment charade this week as well–and also are paying for it.

Michigan GOP chairwoman Laura Cox said in a statement:

Today, Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens decided to join with Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the most radical members of their party by jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. For nearly three years, Democrats and their allies in the media have conducted a witch-hunt against President Trump in an attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election. Time and time again their accusations have been proven false, and I find it shameful that Slotkin and Stevens have chosen to put their political ambitions ahead of the real issues facing their constituents.

These are just a taste of the lines of attack Republicans have ready for the Democrats if they continue wallowing deeper into this mess. The extent to which the impeachment fight, along with other national trends heading into next year’s presidential and congressional elections, could affect the outcome of the 2020 elections could be monstrous.

“By pushing for impeachment, Democrats and their allies in the media are making a major strategic mistake,” Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and former White House official who advises the president’s son Donald Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. “They’re literally walking directly into a buzz saw and don’t even seem to realize it.”

What’s more, while they draw attention to the Biden-Ukraine corruption questions, Biden continues slipping in the polls in the Democrat primary. Biden’s team has attempted to frame this battle as a sign that Trump is worried about facing the former Vice President head-to-head, while avoiding answering questions about what he did as Vice President in Ukraine in connection with getting a prosecutor investigating a company on whose board his son served fired in exchange for releasing U.S. taxpayer-funded aid and then bragging about it at a public event.

But in reality, the intense scrutiny is waking the country–including many Democrat voters who may not have known much about Hunter Biden’s business dealing in Ukraine or in China or elsewhere and how much of a liability they could be to his father politically.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)–a leftist socialist rising star on the hard edge of her party far outside the mainstream–has surged past Biden in polling in several states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and California. She is virtually or statistically tied with Biden in a number of national polls as well and has seen her numbers increase even in Biden strongholds like Nevada–leaving South Carolina as basically the only early state refuge for the one-time Democrat frontrunner.

If Warren is able to sustain this surge into winning the nomination, while Biden keeps slipping and falling away–all while Trump powers his way through this mess as he has done several times before with other Democrat-driven scandals–the 2020 election could end up becoming a Warren-versus-Trump referendum of socialism-versus-capitalism where the Democrat Party’s new extremist wing takes center stage with no accomplishments to point to since they won the House majority back–all part of why they are going for impeachment in the first place, because they have no other path to beat Trump, some Republicans argue, so they are going for broke with this strategy.

“Despite an all-out assault on President Trump, he still has a higher approval rating than Obama did at this point in time,” Steve Guest of the Republican National Committee said. “This round of baseless calls for impeachment is the Democrats’ acknowledgment of their inability to beat President Trump at the ballot box so they’ll try impeachment instead.”"

The actor-activist hosted the LGBTQ presidential forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday, which featured all of the Democrat presidential candidates except Sanders.

The 38-year-old star spoke to the Guardian following the forum and criticized Sanders for skipping the event.

“I was disappointed to not see all of the candidates here. I was further disappointed to hear this was not the only LGBTQ event Bernie was making other commitments for,” Ross said. “You don’t show up for both of our LGBTQ events? That’s obviously telling us all we need to know.”

The Pose actor claimed access to inside information, which purportedly revealed that Sanders’ prior commitments included visiting historically black colleges and universities as well as an “old black barbershop”:

I’m going to risk being super real here for a second. When you’re on the campaign trail, what’s happening a lot – and what a lot of these candidates have to avoid – is being seen as looking for a photo op. To be seen in certain communities and spaces. I heard that he was not only visiting the [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but also visiting an old black barbershop.

“Found out Bernie has a prior commitments to visit HBCUs in North Carolina and Prestige Barber College (a black barbershop) and will be touring the civil rights museum,” Ross tweeted last week, alongside a sarcastic GIF of The Office’s Michael Scott:

Ross told the Guardian that it is a struggle to “get folks in my own black community to understand that being black and being LGBTQ are not mutally exclusive”:

What I hope Bernie would learn is you don’t have to pander to just one aspect of the black community. If he would have been at the LGBTQ forum tonight, he would have seen we were talking about issues affecting people of color. I think it was a huge misstep on his part. And I’m not here for any of the excuses. I say: ‘Make it up to me. Make it up to us.'”

Several social media users disagreed with the former model’s critique of Sanders.

“To question Bernie Sanders stance on lgbtq rights is the most ridiculous thing ever and shows your bias against him,” one user wrote.

“I don’t think he skipped this forum because he doesn’t believe in equal rights for all,” another said.

“Except you decided to focus on one candidate who has the most robust background on this issue. Also, he was at a HBCU which was already scheduled. To think sanders is weak on LGBTQ is frankly laughable,” another added.

The backlash continued to escalate, leading Ross to announce a break from social media “for a while.”

This would not be the first time Sanders has experienced accusations of harassment and intimidation related to his supporters. Black leaders signed a letter last week, which detailed alleged “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. The alleged harassment followed the socialist senator’s loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement.

As Breitbart News reported:

A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter. … The leaders continued, demanding the Sanders campaign “unequivocally denounce the racism in its ranks, and issue a public statement separating themselves from these abhorrent attacks.” They also urged Democrats across the board – both Sanders supporters and Warren supporters – to come together to “defeat one of the most serious threats to peace and justice in our lifetimes.” “We cannot wait to make justice real amongst the resisters — our lives literally depend on each other,” the leaders added in the letter.

Sanders followed up with a tweet, which read, “This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space. We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House.”

Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. But when you put Quinnipiac's latest into the context of other recent polls, it's pretty clear that Warren is gaining everywhere.

Warren's national numbers are up since the September primary debate. She comes in with an average of 23% in debate qualifying polls taken after the debate. That's still behind Biden's 28%, but not by much. The trendline is what is important here. Warren was at 18% in an average of qualifying national polls taken in September before the debates.

The 5-point climb for Warren post-debate seems to be a continuation of a trend we've seen for months.

In a close race for third place, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received 12% in the poll, followed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 10%.

This is the fourth qualifying poll to show Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard with 2% support or higher, meaning she has now met both the polling and fundraising requirements to join the other 11 candidates who have qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

California Sen. Kamala Harris got 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang received 2% each. All other candidates received 1% or less in the New Hampshire poll.

In July, CNN's poll with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.

Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.

Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.

Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).

But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.

Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 17 to 21, 2019 with 401 New Hampshire voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2020. Results among likely Democratic primary voters have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points."

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are virtually deadlocked in a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new national poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University.

The poll shows Warren at 27% and Biden at 25% among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, and is the first major national poll to show Warren in this strong a position since polling in Iowa and New Hampshire also found the two knotted at the top of the field. Although the difference between the candidates' numbers is within the poll's margin of error, the Massachusetts Democrat's new ranking is the first time a candidate other than the former vice president has topped the pack since Quinnipiac started posing the question in March.

The two candidates also saw change in support from the poll's August results, when Biden was at 32% and Warren was at 19%.

The poll reflects a tightening Democratic race as well as Warren's increasing consolidation of the progressive vote and making inroads among black voters. Her support among that crucial demographic bloc has climbed dramatically in recent months, from 4% in July to 8% in August to 19% now. Biden's support among black voters, meanwhile, has dipped from 53% to 40% over the same time. The numbers signal a potential softening in a key base for Biden's campaign, as well as an ability for Warren to grow support beyond white college-educated liberals.

In the new poll, Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (16%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (7%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%). All other candidates got 2% or lower in the poll.

Lau noted that the campaign's biggest expense at the moment is staff but said he expects that to soon become media spending, with a bigger bulk of the expenditure going towards digital ads than TV.

""At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election -- by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,"" Lau wrote.

Bernie Sanders is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.

The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.

But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.

Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.

The new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.

Perhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders' 22%.

Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign's internal numbers painted a different picture. But even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away.

The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.

""It can't be this national campaign anymore. He's got to go on TV in Iowa. He's got to park himself in Iowa. He's got to show that he's the underdog fighting back,"" one of the aides told CNN.

The aide, who said that staff in Iowa has been ""screaming for Bernie to get on TV"" there, suggested that Sanders had overestimated his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I think there was initially this sense of, which candidates always want to do, they want to expand,"" the aide said. ""And so I think there was a sense in the campaign, probably a little bit wrongly, that he had an Iowa and New Hampshire base and was going to focus on South Carolina and Nevada and California and expanding. And I think what this is showing is he's got to just go back to basics.""

In an interview, campaign manager Faiz Shakir brushed off criticism that Sanders has spent too much time building a national brand, along with the suggestion that it had cost him in those early states. He pointed to Sanders' recent travels in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Colorado as evidence that the campaign is prepared for the long haul.

""We have four fingers in the air,"" Shakir said, referencing the start of the fourth quarter of 2019. ""We are ready to finish strong and, with that, comes an adjustment in the time and attention we pay to certain parts of the map and that includes Iowa and New Hampshire.""

But Shakir conceded that the shrinking calendar meant the campaign's margin for error was diminishing too.

""The arguments that we have framed up for the public, they need to come through clearly in this next period of time,"" he said of Sanders' efforts in Iowa. ""I think delivering that message is absolutely critical here in the fourth quarter. We have put ourselves in a position to do very well.""

A second senior aide also indicated that a move to focus more on Iowa and New Hampshire was imminent. That doesn't mean Sanders plans to eschew future trips to join striking union workers outside those states, as he did this week, but that Iowa, where he kicked off his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour on Monday, is soon likely to serve as a de facto base of operations.

Shakir also told CNN that Sanders, after parting ways earlier this year with the firm that made his ads in 2016, has personally decided to use the campaign's in-house team to produce his first round of television spots. The group, a fixture on the trail with the Sanders, began shooting elements for its first TV ad this week. Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have already begun to run ads in the state. Warren on Tuesday announced a planned eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We have a major advantage over other campaigns in that we have a lot more cash on hand,"" Shakir said of the campaign's approach to ad expenditures. ""You can use it correctly, or you can squander it. We are trying to stick to our strategy and make sure we are using our resources wisely.""

The back-and-forth over the campaign's media strategy has been pointed, but both of the senior aides who spoke to CNN touched on a more fundamental source of internal tension: the increasingly public disconnect between state level operations, most notably seen in New Hampshire, and the campaign's national leadership.

Those conflicts have been stoked, the aides said, by mostly lower level staffers, many of them Sanders loyalists from 2016 who have bristled at the 2020 leadership's tone and more exacting standards.

A progressive consultant familiar with the campaign's operation in New England told CNN that unsettled Sanders diehards pushed, successfully, for the ouster of former New Hampshire state director Joe Caiazzo, who was reassigned to Massachusetts. Caiazzo, who declined to comment, has been replaced by Shannon Jackson, a more familiar face who managed Sanders' 2018 Senate race.

According to a new poll from Monmouth released Tuesday, the campaign is facing increased headwinds in New Hampshire, where Warren -- as she did in Iowa -- has surged into the top-tier with Biden. Sanders, again, sits third with 12% to Warren's 27%.

The progressive consultant also said the campaign's internal politics were complicating efforts to broaden its appeal and forge alliances with outside grassroots groups.

""It's very confusing,"" the progressive consultant said of communications with the campaign. ""I have talked to people that hear from all of them -- that hear from (senior adviser) Chuck Rocha, that hear from (senior adviser) Jeff Weaver and that hear from Faiz. But my understanding is that if you want to get to Bernie, it's not Faiz that you go through. It's Weaver or (deputy campaign manager) Ari Rabin-Havt.""

For new groups only beginning to make sense of the progressive firmament, the process of sorting out the campaign hierarchy can be a turn-off -- especially when Warren's team has developed a reputation for proactively seeking out those less seasoned activists.

One of the senior Sanders aides conceded that the growing pains have been, at times, sharper than many expected. In 2016, the aide said, the absence at times of a coherent national operation meant that field staff had much more autonomy. The shakeup in New Hampshire, and lower level changes in Iowa, were largely instigated by internal arguments rooted in differing ideas about how to run a successful campaign without betraying the spirit of Sanders' first run.

Shakir conceded that there is a level of angst between staff at the local level and the national office. But he insisted that the decisions being made are part of a desire to see the vision of the candidate executed.

In the end, he argued, the campaign team -- from top to bottom -- needs to trust in Sanders' judgment.

""We all take our leadership and follow the direction of Bernie Sanders and he drives the strategy, and the argument of how we are going to win people over,"" Shakir said. ""I think to the extent that there's other people on campaign who have different views, I respect and appreciate that.

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, in the past, has cautioned against impeaching Trump. Her comments on Tuesday came shortly before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in doing so.

Trump faces outrage over reports that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Zelensky -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. The call is also the subject of a whistleblower complaint.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee just announced the debate criteria for November. As expected, it has modestly raised the bar again, asking for candidates to meet a slightly higher polling and donor threshold than the last debates. But like my elderly cat when we got a slightly taller box spring, some candidates just can't make the leap.

And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced to adjust their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks are excluding highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are complaining the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races.

But first, let's be clear that Democratic primary voters want to narrow the field. Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while disadvantaging others (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.

The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes tossed around not-so-veiled references to the size of their penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.

Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee.

And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a reflection of name recognition among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud.

It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.

Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be down to eight

But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a polling average of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.

So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:

The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.

Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?

Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages here. But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate (Biden). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more?

These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden in 2007 (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).

And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs.

But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.

Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"

Importantly, some issues involving individual GM plants have been resolved or are close to resolution, the sources said.

That mostly leaves the so-called national issues, including those involving pay and benefits for GM's nearly 50,000 hourly workers. Those are typically the last to be settled before a tentative labor deal can be reached. The two sides have been talking about those national issues since formal negotiations started in July

A final agreement can come together quickly in a strike. Any tentative deal needs the approval of union members, though the strike could end before a vote.

Warren’s renewed call for impeachment follows reports of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) holding a 4 p.m. Democrat caucus meeting on Tuesday to discuss impeachment. While Pelosi has been hesitant to pursue the matter – telling Democrats during a caucus-wide call in August the public, “isn’t there on impeachment” – her Democrat colleagues appear to be using the alleged “whistleblower” case to push the inquiry, as the Mueller investigation turned out to be a bust:

The alleged whistleblower, who did not even directly hear the purported conversations from Ukrainian leaders, claimed the president urged officials to reopen inquiries into Hunter Biden’s business dealings. As Breitbart News reported, “it is not clear what law, if any, Trump would have broken by urging the Ukrainian government to re-open the case.”

While estimates slightly vary, Democrats are short of a pro-impeachment majority in the House, with 175 in support out of the 235 member caucus. Democrats need 218 votes in the House to make it a reality. Even so, the inquiry would likely flop in the Republican-led Senate, requiring a two-thirds majority – or 67 senators – to vote in favor of impeaching the president.

Warren has increased her calls for impeachment in recent days, arguing that Congress should have taken swift action following the release of the Mueller report, despite the former special counsel not finding any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.

“After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,” Warren wrote last Friday.

“By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president,” she continued, accusing Trump of continuing to commit crimes:

A president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won’t either. Today’s news confirmed he thinks he’s above the law. If we do nothing, he’ll be right. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 20, 2019

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) announced Tuesday that she is beefing up her presidential campaign as she surges in several primary polls across the country.

In a memo to supporters, campaign manager Roger Lau wrote the campaign will grow its presence in Flordia, Texas, California, Illinois, Maine, and Georgia, as well as hire additional staff to help support Democrats running in competitive state legislature races in Michigan and Minnesota.

“Remember: this election is about more than just beating Donald Trump — he’s just the worst symptom of a corrupt system,” Lau wrote. “If we want to make big, structural change, we need to make sure Democrats control the U.S. House and Senate and win important gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country,” explained Lau.

Further, the campaign said it hopes to increase resources for volunteers with a canvassing app to enable them to converse with voters.

“This is how we dream big, fight hard, and win. We’ve got a plan to make sure Elizabeth is the next president of the United States. And when she’s in the Oval Office — when our plans go from big ideas to reality with the help of this grassroots movement — I want you to know that you helped make it happen,” Lau continued.

The announcement comes as the Warren campaign readies an eight-figure ad buy in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada.

“At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election — by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,” Lau said of the television blitz.

Meanwhile, Warren has solidified her status as the frontrunner in the Democrat presidential primary contest this week, two newly-released polls show.

Politico reports:

Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a new poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support.

Though some polls show Warren pulling ahead of Biden in some early primary and caucus states, a Real Clear Politics polling average shows the Massachusetts Democrat still trails the former vice president by roughly ten percent."

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

This is supposed to be the New Sensitivity, right?

We’re supposed to be “perfecting” our society into something more pure and decent, right?

Well, then, explain to me just how in the hell a kid in a sombrero is “problematic” and not a 70-year-old white woman who spent decades wearing the equivalent of “redface” to advance herself?

For decades, Elizabeth Warren committed the most audacious act of cultural appropriation I have ever seen in a national politician. For decades, Warren pretended to be a Cherokee Indian, and to this day, even though her DNA test proves she’s has no more native blood (and probably less) than the average white American, she still hasn’t admitted she is not part Cherokee.

To everyday Americans, it’s her cheating that galls us; it’s someone pretending to be someone she’s not as a means to gain an advantage that galls us.

The Puritan Wokesters, though, if they actually were who they say they are, if they actually stood for what they say they stand for, should be apoplectic over Cherokee Warren, because what she did is not only outrageous, is not only a privileged white woman stealing a cultural identity purely for mercenary purposes, but you also have to ask yourself how many real-life people of color were not hired or promoted or given an opportunity because Cherokee Warren had already filled that slot?

What more proof is there that the Woke Movement is a total fraud filled with partisan liars. Here Warren is surging in the Democrat primary to a point where the Democrat presidential nomination is probably hers to lose. The latest polls show her up in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two primary states, and so far she has paid zero price from the Woke Police for decades and decades and decades of cultural appropriation.

Look at it this way…

If your child dresses as a Cherokee Indian this Halloween, the Woke-tards will be coming after you and him.

But Elizabeth Warren can spend decades pretending to be a Cherokee Indian as a means to get rich and famous and powerful, and these same people refuse to utter a peep.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” Rourke, billionaire climate crusader Tom Steyer, and technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The next debate, co-hosted by the New York Times and CNN, is scheduled for October 15th in Westerville, Ohio.

News of Gabbard’s inclusion in the fourth debate comes one day after the DNC announced intensified requirements for candidates to clinch a spot at the fifth debate in November. White House hopefuls will need to garner at 3 percent or higher in four polls or at least 5 percent in a pair of early-state polls as well as enjoys the support of 165,000 campaign donors."

Many Americans are frightened by the left-wing vision promoted by Democrats, said Olsen.

“I think it’s clear that a lot of [Democrat] policies — and particularly the stridency with which they are promoted — scare a lot of people, even the people who don’t like President Trump,” assessed Olsen.

LISTEN:



Olsen continued, “[Full-wokeness] would mobilize every Trump supporter to make sure they get out and vote, because the combination of economic policies and the cultural stridency unites every wing of the Trump coalition.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) record of supporting “full-woke” positions will become a political liability in a presidential election, determined Olsen.

“I have a hard time seeing how Warren can avoid that,” speculated Olsen. “She might want to campaign on the economy, but on the other hand, she’s already gone full-woke. She’s already called for reparations. She’s already said that the border should be decriminalized, [and] that there should be no such thing as illegal immigration. She’s already embraced radical positions on abortion.”

Olsen added, “It’s very hard to see how [Elizabeth Warren] avoids talking about that, because you know that the president and Republicans will remind her over and over and over again. I think she’s already stepped into that, so to speak, and it’s going to be hard for her to extricate herself.”

Trump’s greatest political threat is from a Democrat nominee who escapes “full-wokeness,” said Olsen.

“The most formidable opponent [for Donald Trump] is anyone who doesn’t scare the middle,” Olsen stated. “Right now, [Joe Biden] is avoiding full-wokeness. He’s talking about things in a way where he goes part of the way, but he doesn’t go all the way there.”

Joe Biden may move further left over the course of the Democrats’ presidential nomination process, noted Olsen.

“It’s not clear that the Biden we’re seeing now is the Biden we’re going to see in February,” Olsen said. “Will he move left — and sharply left — to get himself the nomination? I don’t know. And I think that if Biden does, then that — plus his notable penchant for gaffes and his obvious inability to maintain a steady debate performance across an entire two hours — will eventually be questions that voters will consider.”

Mansour highlighted a recent focus group of female swing voters examining Warren’s political appeal, inviting Olsen’s analysis on the Massachusetts senator’s likability.

Warren’s “demeanor,” arraigned Olsen, is unappealing to a broad swathe of the electorate.

“I’ve been watching the Democratic debates, and the thing that strikes me — as a former graduate of a well-ranked law school — is how much she reminds me of what she actually is, which is a law professor,” Olsen expressed.

Olsen continued, “The same demeanor of ‘the professor’s always right,’ staring straight out as if you were looking at a class with 200 students in it, and conducting the sort of pointed discussion that really doesn’t admit of discussion.”

Olsen went on, “Unfortunately, the election is not a classroom where students have to agree with you or be quiet. … In an election, people decide whether or not they like the person at the front of the room, and it doesn’t surprise me that a lot of people who don’t already agree with her positions — not just the populist positions, but the whole demeanor of ‘everything is awful and needs to be thrown upside down’ — [don’t] find her terribly attractive, particularly people who don’t have college degrees.”

Trump authorized the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript” of his conversation with Zelensky on Tuesday.

The transcript does not provide a “smoking gun,” as Democrat candidates proclaim. Rather, it shows Trump asking the Ukranian leader to further look into the 2016 election meddling roots — something Democrats, given their self-described goals of ensuring election security, would be in favor of.

Trump said:

I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

Biden’s son was not mentioned until after the fact:

… I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

As the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel explained:

2)As to call transcript itself: Trump’s actual “favor” is that Ukraine look backward, to what happened in the 2016 election. This is a legitimate ask, since election meddling looks to have come from both Russia and Ukraine. — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019

4)It is actually Zelensky who brings up Rudy Giuliani—saying they can’t wait to “meet him.” And it is Zelensky who references “that investigation,” as he goes on to promise that “all investigations will be done openly and candidly.” — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019

He smeared Ilhan Omar. He smeared San Francisco. He denied the existence of an obvious delay in military aid to Ukraine. He denied that the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. He confused champion mountain climbers by claiming that champion mountain climbers had tried and failed to climb his border wall.

President Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites.

Seventy-nine false claims is down from 90 the week prior to last , Trump's highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims.

Trump made 29 of last week's 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters.

Twenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats.

The most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay

Facing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay.

""I didn't delay anything,"" he told reporters . ""We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge.""

The money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was openly defending the delay he had said did not happen.

""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they're not doing it,"" he said -- which is also not true.

The most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again

This time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party

For sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump's story about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it.

Some of Trump's false claims are so bizarre that it's almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness.

Whatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party.

We must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the ""Democrat Party.""

He said last week, again, that he is not only using ""Democrat Party"" because it sounds worse but because that is the party's official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer ""Democratic Party,"" in which case he might call them that.

Yes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing.

Here is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update:

Google and the 2016 election

""Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two million to 10.5 million votes, and we won."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Joe Biden

Hunter Biden and the investigation

""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won't get a very large amount of U.S. money..."" -- September 21 tweet

""And, you know, he really made it a -- it was an offer. It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, 'I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters after Coast Guard briefing in Houston

Facts First: There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg.

You can read a full fact check on Trump's claims about the Bidens and Ukraine here

Joe Biden and ""the case""

""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden's son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired.

Trump's allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

Joe Biden's previous comments

""This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did. And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again."" And: ""I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker : Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'""

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

Cokie Roberts

""I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional."" -- September 17 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: Trump had met Roberts, who : Trump had met Roberts, who died on September 17. As CNN's Brian Stelter noted , she interviewed him at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she asked him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question ""very nasty."")

Trump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent.

San Francisco, the ocean and needles

""We'll start with those two cities and we're looking at San Francisco, we're looking at Los Angeles. And we're looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there's tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they're going through what's called a storm sewer. That's for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don't have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it's a terrible situation. That's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them the notice very soon."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump's claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's claims ""ridiculous,"" saying in a statement that the city's sewer system ""ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants."" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay, told the Mercury News: ""In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported : ""Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 'We haven't had any (recent) problems with syringes,' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.""

Mountain climbers and the wall

""We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast : There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast contacted several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House.

The wall and San Diego

""You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, 'You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.'"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we : It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we reported at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump's repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall. San Diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to the proposal, and even the Republican mayor Trump was praising here, Kevin Faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed

The name of the Democratic Party

Trump said he calls the Democratic Party the ""Democrat Party"" not only because ""Democrat"" sounds worse than ""Democratic"" but because ""that's their name, the Democrat Party""; he said, ""Frankly, they should probably change it -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly : The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly insisted that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide.

A tweet on Ilhan Omar

Trump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump wrote , ""IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!"" -- September 18 tweet

Facts First: The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11. She was attending an event, called Breaking Concrete Ceilings, connected to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference.

Nuclear weapons

""Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, 'tippy-top shape.' Tippy-top. It's — we have new and we have renovated and it's — it's incredible."" --September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

""As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully -- and we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear. And the rest of our military is all brand new. The nuclear now is at a level that's it's never been before."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to : ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to cost more than $1 trillion . And experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the arsenal.

""I feel comfortable saying that the scientific studies to date have yet to provide any evidence that the nuclear arsenal was 'tired' or in any way at risk of being ineffective if called upon,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy.

""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal — but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Kemp, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, said that, with the exception of a hypothetical top-secret development she doesn't know about, ""everything is the same"" in the deployed arsenal ""as it was in January 2017"" -- aside from reductions the US made to fulfill its obligations under the New START treaty with Russia.

While ""the Trump administration has certainly requested and received increased funding for nuclear modernization,"" Bell said, ""this is a trajectory we have been on since 2010 "" -- and ""he hasn't really changed anything yet.""

""Budgets clearly demonstrate that we have spent enormous of money on nuclear modernization over the past decade,"" said Bell, who served in the State Department under Obama from 2010 to 2017.

A wall at the Democratic convention?

Talking about the large barriers he had visited at a California border site and is planning to erect elsewhere, Trump was asked if that's what he wants around the White House grounds. He said, ""No, but that's what the Democrats are putting up around their convention...They're building a big wall around their convention. Which they should do."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention. They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. ""It's not true,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN.

There will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California.

The Green New Deal and cars

Trump said that, under the Democrats' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric -- single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The congressional : The congressional resolution on the Green New Deal does not include any restrictions on the number of cars people could own or the number of miles they could drive.

The proposal calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.""

Bay of Pigs veterans

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The : Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The endorsement was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.)

Trump's Cuban American support in 2016

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%..."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses : Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses reported on by the Miami Herald when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received ""84%"" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%.

The Herald reported: ""Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations."" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump's best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%.

Military aid to Ukraine

Question: ""How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?"" Trump: ""Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. : Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid.

Trump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed by members of Congress and by people who were serving in the Ukrainian government this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn't actually happen until September.

The estate tax

""And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely

It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""

Oil prices

""Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: : Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate futures both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters reported

We can't fact check Trump's hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago.

The cost of the Mueller investigation

""House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent..."" -- September 16 tweet

""...they spent $40 million -- there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.

The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.

Here's a list of claims we've fact checked before in one of our weekly updates:

Immigration

Mexican troops on the border

""And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico's southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said , ""Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.""

Mexico's immigration assistance

""You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they're doing just the opposite. They've really been incredible."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. ""The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),"" Selee said. He added: ""The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border.""

Building the wall

""Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

""Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we're building it at a breakneck speed."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump's tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are ""many"" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction.

Democrats and the border

Trump said the Democrats have an agenda of ""open borders."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Human trafficking

""If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data.

Experts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. ""I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I've done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,"" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars.

Many victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration found that ""in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.""

Democrats

The Green New Deal, cows and planes

""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Democrats' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes.

Trump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A ""FAQ"" page that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to ""net-zero"" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.""

The FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector"" and ""working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.

Popularity and accomplishments

Special election in North Carolina's 9th District

Trump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down ""17 points three weeks ago,"" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Bishop was not down 17 points in any : Bishop was not down 17 points in any public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins.

When we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded ""Try harder"" -- pointing to a tweet by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14.

But 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine's tweet did not include any of that information.

Special election in North Carolina's 3rd District

Trump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District, ""was up a couple of points"" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One : Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One late poll had him up by 11 points.

The poll was in line with pundits' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.

Trump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but ""a couple of points"" is incorrect.

Suppression polls

""Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls, and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They're no different. They're suppression polls."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.

Veterans Choice

Trump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, ""They've tried to get that for 45 years. They haven't been able to get it. But I'm good at getting things."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Foreign and military affairs

Venezuela's wealth

""Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Venezuela was not one of the world's wealthiest countries 15 years ago.

The International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world's countries, but nowhere near the top.

""Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,"" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.

The war in Afghanistan

""We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they've ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about how ""hard"" the US is attacking the Taliban. ""Nineteen years of war,"" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says ""19 years.""

The Iran nuclear deal

""The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don't have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check : Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check here

ISIS fighters and Europe

""We have thousands of ISIS fighters and we want those fighters to be taken -- you're talking about, I think it's a big -- we have thousands of ISIS fighters that we've taken into -- we've defeated 100% of the caliphate. We are holding in various forms of prison. We're holding thousands of people. Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""They mostly come out of Europe."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: According to Trump's own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries.

Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Remains from North Korea

""We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back. We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them 'our heroes.' And they were our heroes. And they're coming back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort.

Trump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim here

Trade

Unions and the USMCA

Trump said of his USMCA trade agreement, ""Unions love it."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation : The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation says it will be a ""disaster for workers"" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.

Trade deficit with China

Trump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to ""to take out $500 billion a year"" or even ""more than that"" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was : Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

Aid to farmers

Talking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, ""And I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a : It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a second announcement that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government's tracking data as of September 24.

Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump said twice that China is ""eating the tariffs"" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue ""from China.""

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's economic performance

Trump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in ""57 years.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter growth rate was the : China's second-quarter growth rate was the worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

History of the tariffs

On three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received ""10 cents,"" ""100 cents"" or ""billions"" from China.

Facts First: The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we'll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.)

The Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year.

Economy and energy

Automotive investments

""My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. "" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Contrary to Trump's claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump's inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama's (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama's second term, according to the center's Bernard Swiecki.

Just two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump's presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision.

Trump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments. But none of these companies has announced a new US plant since Toyota and Mazda introduced the joint venture in early 2018, though Japanese automakers have made additional investments in existing facilities and Japanese truck company Hino Motors has built a truck-cab assembly plant in West Virginia.

""We know of no German or Japanese automakers currently looking to place additional car or truck assembly capacity in the United States,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's vice president of industry, labor and economics.

Energy independence

""Well, we have the Strategic — if you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody now."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters

""So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before."" -- September 18 tweet

""We're independent, as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is : While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted , the US also consumed more energy than it produced.

There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year.

""The US is still a net importer of crude and refined products, although the trend of declining dependence on imports should continue due to increased domestic production of unconventional oil and biofuels and growing investment in export infrastructure following the 2015 repeal of the crude export ban,"" said Josh Price, a senior analyst for energy and utilities at Height Capital Markets. ""Most of these factors preceded President Trump and have not been significantly altered by administration policies.""

The decrease in US imports and increase in exports began before the Trump administration. Obama presided over a boom in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.

""The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products. Executive policy has had little to do with the explosive gains, which are attributable to technology and price,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.

It's worth noting that the US will still be using large quantities of foreign energy even if it does become a net exporter next year. In other words, it will not be completely independent from foreign suppliers.

Energy production

Trump claimed four times that the US had only recently become the world's largest producer of oil and gas; in one of the claims, he added a message of self-congratulation in the third person: ""Thank you, Mr. President!""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under Obama, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Asian American unemployment

Facts First: Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was : Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 2.8% in August -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.

Overall unemployment

""Our job numbers for African Americans are the best in history. You saw the new ones came out; they're even better than they were two months ago. Hispanic, the best in history. Asian, the best in history. Overall, they're phenomenal. The best in 51 years. And I think we'll soon be historic on that one too."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

""We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""And unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years, and very soon, we think that will be broken to be a historic number."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The unemployment rate over this spring and summer -- 3.7% in each of June, July and August, 3.6% in each of April and May -- has been the lowest since December 1969, slightly less than 50 years ago; all of these rates were well off the record 2.5%, set in 1953.

The dollar

""Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER!"" -- September 16 tweet

Facts First: The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check : The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Women's unemployment

Trump said at his New Mexico rally that unemployment numbers for women were the best in ""71 years.""

Facts First: This was his usual slight exaggeration. The rate this summer has been the lowest since 1953, 66 years ago.

Inflation

Trump claimed three times that there is ""no inflation."" Facts First: There is inflation: 1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Prescription drug prices

Trump claimed that last year was ""the first year in 51 years where prices went down"" for prescription drugs. -- September 16 exchange w with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check : This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures.

Pre-existing conditions

""And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Republicans will always do that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass : This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass bills that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are now trying to get the courts to declare Obamacare void, without a plan to replace those pre-existing protections if their lawsuit succeeds.

Air quality

""And I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country?"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""President Obama said they (prisoners at Guantanamo Bay) were going to be totally completed and emptied out by the time he left office. And very much like judges, where, as you know, I ended up with 138 slots, you had a situation where that wasn't cleaned out."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges, including court of appeals judges, because President Obama did us a great favor. when I came in, I said, 'I assume I have no judges to appoint.' 'No sir, you have 138 judges.' 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not enter office with 138 judicial vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the confirmation of many of Obama's judicial nominees late in his term; Obama obviously didn't intend to ""hand"" vacancies to Trump."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fears the Democrat-led House impeachment effort could lead President Trump to ultimately claim vindication, he told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday the launch of an official impeachment inquiry, using the whistleblower complaint as a launching point. This follows months of far-left “Squad” members pushing impeachment and Pelosi’s continuous stiff-arming of such efforts.

“I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,” Pelosi announced at a Capitol Hill press conference.

“I am directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,” she said.

“The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law,” she continued, citing the Founding Fathers.

“Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote that times have found us, that times found them to fight for and establish our democracy,” she added. “The times have found us today”:

Nancy Pelosi: ""Therefore today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" pic.twitter.com/HyHKD39N7M — Axios (@axios) September 24, 2019

Several 2020 Democrat candidates called for the inquiry prior to Pelosi’s announcement.

“This isn’t a partisan issue—or shouldn’t be,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) tweeted. “When the president of the United States is working with other countries to interfere with our elections, we should begin impeachment proceedings.”

“It was true when I said it in 2017 running for Senate in Texas and it’s still true today: President Trump should be impeached,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) added.

“The House must impeach. It must start today,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote.

Noticeably absent though, was Sanders. While he believes that “impeachable offenses” exist, he signaled that Democrats may be acting too hastily and would not say if he would support the impeachment effort if it made it to the Senate.

“Here’s the dilemma that you have,” Sanders told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, according to BuzzFeed News. “Now I don’t know — I’ll tell you that my gut is that the average Republican in the Senate and the House is totally intimidated by President Trump.”

“And at this particular point, I have my doubts, like you all. I have my doubts that any Republican, or very few, would vote against him,” he continued, detailing his fear. Sanders worries that – in the event that the impeachment effort gets passed on to the Senate – which would require a two-thirds majority (or 67 votes) – it would fail and Trump would claim vindication as a result.

“I know and you know what [Trump] will do: ‘I am vindicated! … I am vindicated!’ And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed.

“But what do you do when you have a president who has acted in an unconstitutional way? If that is the findings,” Sanders continued. “Again, I don’t want to judge it. I think that is the face. But there is a process that has to take place.”

Sanders reiterated that he believes there are impeachable offenses, and he has signaled such before, floating an inquiry in May:

It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 23, 2019

“I believe that there are impeachable offenses. That’s my view. But my view is not good enough,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed News.

“I happen to believe that there are grounds to do it. But you have to lay it out,” Sanders explained, refusing to reveal his thoughts on the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Fellow presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken her position on impeachment farther than Sanders, telling CNN’s Newsroom on Tuesday that impeachment would “further tear apart an already divided country.”

“Impeachment is something — that is a step that will divide the country and will be worse off for our country,” she said."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) declared on Tuesday that “billionaires should not exist” as part of the rollout of his massive proposal to redistribute wealth in America via an “extreme wealth” tax, which he claims will “reduce the outrageous level of inequality that exists in America today.”

Sanders unveiled his plan to redistribute wealth in the U.S. via an “extreme wealth tax,” which the socialist senator says will apply to the “top 0.1 percent.” While Sanders’ plan is reminiscent of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) proposed wealth tax, it goes even further, taxing more individuals at even higher rates.

For example, Sanders proposes to implement a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million. The percentage increases alongside the value of assets:

The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.

“These brackets are halved for singles,” Sanders explains.

The socialist senator admits the goal of his ultra-progressive redistribution proposal, boasting that — under his plan — the wealth of billionaires “would be cut in half over 15 years” and declaring that “billionaires should not exist”:

Billionaires should not exist. https://t.co/hgR6CeFvLa — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

There is no justice when three billionaires are able to own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire country. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people. Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Sanders’ proposal would also spur the creation of a “national wealth registry” and provide an “increase in IRS funding” in order to manage a swell of new audits.

It states:

In order to ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax, the proposal includes a number of key enforcement policies. First, it would create a national wealth registry and significant additional third party reporting requirements. Second, it includes an increase in IRS funding for enforcement and requires the IRS to perform an audit of 30 percent of wealth tax returns for those in the 1 percent bracket and a 100 percent audit rate for all billionaires. Third, the wealth tax includes a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and 60 percent over $1 billion for all wealthy individual seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax. Finally, the wealth tax proposal will include enhancements to the international tax enforcement and anti-money laundering regime including the strengthening of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.

The presidential candidate argues the U.S. already taxes inherited wealth via the estate tax and says his proposal is constitutional, citing two Yale law professors, Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, who have expressed support for the radical concept. Sanders adds that it is “not radical” to ask the wealthy to “pay their fair share.”

His proposal is expected to result in $4.5 trillion over the next decade, according to University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Nonetheless, that number does not come close to paying for his expansive, expensive proposals, such as his $16 trillion Green New Deal proposal or Medicare for All, which could — by some estimates — cost the U.S. over $60 trillion over the next decade alone.

Sanders’ ideological ally, Warren, has also introduced a wealth tax, although it does not go as far. She proposes implementing a two percent wealth tax on those with $50 million in assets, as opposed to Sanders’ $32 million. Warren’s plan increases the tax to three percent for those with assets of $1 billion or greater, with no distinction between couples or single filers. She, like Sanders, plans to fund her costly proposals via the wealth tax, although Saez and Zucman estimate that her proposal would result in $2.6 trillion over the next decade, $1.9 trillion less than Sanders’ proposal.

“If we make the top 0.1% pay their fair share in taxes, their quality of life would not change at all,” Sanders tweeted following the announcement of his redistribution scheme.

“But we would be able to invest in housing, child care and health care and improve the lives of millions of working people,” he added:"

With zero legislative accomplishments since retaking the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, after nearly a year filled with contentious investigations, hearings, and the coming opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats are betting it all on a quixotic mission to try to take out Trump with impeachment.

A problem they face is that they need 218 votes to pass articles of impeachment out of the House, and an even-steeper 67-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate to convict and remove the president from office. At this stage, Democrats do not even have 218 votes despite their 235-seat majority–they are somewhere, at best for the pro-impeachment crowd, somewhere around 175 pro-impeachment votes but with growing momentum. In the Senate, there is next to zero chance that 20 Republicans would join all 47 Democrats to vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges.

But Democrats, after failing to take on major legislative issues like infrastructure, healthcare, paid family leave, or anything else for that matter, are now pushing forward with opening official impeachment proceedings against Trump.

The Democrats spent all year conducting hearings and investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, only to fail–as the Special Counsel Robert Mueller probe also failed–to find any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between Trump and his campaign and the Russians. Mueller’s investigation and the Democrat-led investigations also failed to uncover evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump, leaving Democrats empty-handed heading into the August recess back in July.

But now, after the emergence of complaints by a supposed “whistleblower” against Trump with regard to a conversation he had with Ukraine’s newly-elected leader about former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the Eastern European NATO ally nation, Democrats have reinvigorated their push for impeachment. They are buoyed by a swelling of support from members in key battleground House districts and renewed energy from top Democrats in leadership, including in particular House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly told her friends that she views impeachment as inevitable now.

It remains unclear exactly what the Democrats would be impeaching Trump for. The content of the supposed “whistleblower” complaint about Trump’s call with Ukraine’s new president Volodymyr Zelensky remains private, as does the transcript of the call. The president has said he is considering releasing the call transcript, but has not done so yet–and he expressed concerns that releasing a call transcript could produce a chilling effect among world leaders who wish to have honest and frank conversations with the president of the United States.

But on Tuesday afternoon, after news broke that Pelosi was moving forward with impeachment, Trump announced via Twitter he has ordered the release of the call transcript in full:

I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

….You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

What’s more, the supposed “whistleblower” technically does not qualify as a whistleblower under the federal law that provides protection to such individuals, despite the media and leftists referring to the person as such, and the person apparently did not even bear witness to the call itself. Even if Trump did what was alleged, it is unclear how that would amount to an illegal act worthy of impeachment and conviction of a U.S. president, as several Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have said.

Nonetheless, impeachment is less of a legal question and more of a political matter. Polling shows impeaching Trump remains very unpopular nationwide, and with 31 Democrats sitting in districts in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016–13 of which he won by more than six percent–with even more than that filling out a broader ring of vulnerable members nearing 50, Democrats could imperil their chances of holding their majority if they go through with this process.

To hit the threshold necessary to impeach Trump–218 votes–Pelosi would need to force several self-portrayed “moderate” Democrats in these approximately 50 battleground districts to support impeachment by voting for it. That prospect, getting these Democrats who go home to the district and campaign on doing things to help their constituents–to actually vote for anti-Trump craze mania has Republicans nationally salivating.

Pelosi has held off the left side of her conference all year on impeachment, arguing it would be a perilous political mission that would endanger Democrats and embolden Trump. But with the rise of the so-called “Squad” led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a New York socialist, Pelosi has allowed the growth of these rising leftist forces in her conference all year, to the point where Ocasi0-Cortez has taken the driver’s seat in pushing the party’s agenda, the other side of the Democrat conference be damned.

Over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez ripped Democrats for holding back on impeachment–ginning up the left side of the conference, firing up the Democrat base, and forcing Pelosi into action:

At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior – it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It’s another to let him. The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It‘s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

Now that Pelosi has jumped at the behest of the 29-year-old socialist freshman from New York and her fellow “Squad” members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ocasio-Cortez is ripping Pelosi for only doing a committee–saying she wants instead a straight-up impeachment vote.

Yes, this is an emergency. We don’t have the luxury of time w/ another committee. Judiciary has been investigating& putting the pieces together for months. Impeachment belongs there. We must honor jurisdiction, historical precedent,& work done + allow Judiciary to move forward. https://t.co/CM0gXN7T1i — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 24, 2019

The complexity of how to structure impeachment proceedings is meaningless in the broader scheme of things politically, Republicans argue, because now in the GOP’s view the Democrat Party–and all of its members–have officially jumped the shark by going for broke on Trump impeachment, facts be damned.

Two supposedly “moderate” New York Democrats who joined the impeachment brigade this week, Reps. Antonio Delgado (D-NY) and Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), are already under fire back home in their district as Empire State Republicans hammer away at them for siding with the lunacy of Ocasio-Cortez.

New York GOP chairman Nick Langworthy said in a statement:

By joining the impeachment mob, Antonio Delgado and Sean Patrick Maloney just abandoned their constituents in favor of AOC and the Squad. The radical left’s endless obsession with trying to take out President Trump and derail his agenda will be rejected by the voters who want their representatives to focus on making their lives better, not their own power. This reckless decision will rightfully go down as the one that cost them their seats.

They are hardly alone. Two Virginia Democrat freshman women, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Elaine Luria (D-VA)–both freshman Democrats representing battleground House districts who co-signed an op-ed with five others nationwide in the Washington Post on Monday evening signaling their openness to impeaching Trump–are under fire in Virginia now for abandoning their constituents in favor of impeachment.

“Both Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger were already critically endangered heading into 2020, by publicly joining the left-wing impeachment jihad they are clearly angling for post-Elected office job opportunities,” John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “The Republican Party of Virginia already has field staff on the ground this year in preparation for 2020 and will only be expanding our presence as next November approaches.”

Another co-signer of their op-ed, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA)–a freshman Democrat who represents Pennsylvania’s sixth congressional district, another battleground–is facing criticism already for siding with the radical efforts to impeach Trump while not delivering on substantive policy matters.

“Representative Chrissy Houlahan has gone Washington as she continues to prove that she cares more about partisan politics than finding solutions to the challenges we face here in Pennsylvania,” John Emmons, a conservative businessman running for the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania’s sixth district for the shot to take on Houlahan next November, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “She’d rather go after the President and try to get onto CNN than get to work for the people of her district. The voters of PA-06 deserve so much better out of their Member of Congress.”

Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), a freshman who co-signed the op-ed and represents a battleground district in Colorado after defeating a GOP incumbent in 2018, took a hit in Colorado for signing onto impeachment.

“From his call for impeachment to his extreme voting record, Jason Crow has put his constituents on the backburner and placed his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of working people,” Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli told Breitbart News. “Colorado’s 6th district won’t forget how Crow sided with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi over them.”

In Michigan, one of the op-ed’s cosigners, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and another fellow freshman Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), joined the impeachment charade this week as well–and also are paying for it.

Michigan GOP chairwoman Laura Cox said in a statement:

Today, Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens decided to join with Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the most radical members of their party by jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. For nearly three years, Democrats and their allies in the media have conducted a witch-hunt against President Trump in an attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election. Time and time again their accusations have been proven false, and I find it shameful that Slotkin and Stevens have chosen to put their political ambitions ahead of the real issues facing their constituents.

These are just a taste of the lines of attack Republicans have ready for the Democrats if they continue wallowing deeper into this mess. The extent to which the impeachment fight, along with other national trends heading into next year’s presidential and congressional elections, could affect the outcome of the 2020 elections could be monstrous.

“By pushing for impeachment, Democrats and their allies in the media are making a major strategic mistake,” Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and former White House official who advises the president’s son Donald Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. “They’re literally walking directly into a buzz saw and don’t even seem to realize it.”

What’s more, while they draw attention to the Biden-Ukraine corruption questions, Biden continues slipping in the polls in the Democrat primary. Biden’s team has attempted to frame this battle as a sign that Trump is worried about facing the former Vice President head-to-head, while avoiding answering questions about what he did as Vice President in Ukraine in connection with getting a prosecutor investigating a company on whose board his son served fired in exchange for releasing U.S. taxpayer-funded aid and then bragging about it at a public event.

But in reality, the intense scrutiny is waking the country–including many Democrat voters who may not have known much about Hunter Biden’s business dealing in Ukraine or in China or elsewhere and how much of a liability they could be to his father politically.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)–a leftist socialist rising star on the hard edge of her party far outside the mainstream–has surged past Biden in polling in several states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and California. She is virtually or statistically tied with Biden in a number of national polls as well and has seen her numbers increase even in Biden strongholds like Nevada–leaving South Carolina as basically the only early state refuge for the one-time Democrat frontrunner.

If Warren is able to sustain this surge into winning the nomination, while Biden keeps slipping and falling away–all while Trump powers his way through this mess as he has done several times before with other Democrat-driven scandals–the 2020 election could end up becoming a Warren-versus-Trump referendum of socialism-versus-capitalism where the Democrat Party’s new extremist wing takes center stage with no accomplishments to point to since they won the House majority back–all part of why they are going for impeachment in the first place, because they have no other path to beat Trump, some Republicans argue, so they are going for broke with this strategy.

“Despite an all-out assault on President Trump, he still has a higher approval rating than Obama did at this point in time,” Steve Guest of the Republican National Committee said. “This round of baseless calls for impeachment is the Democrats’ acknowledgment of their inability to beat President Trump at the ballot box so they’ll try impeachment instead.”"

Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. But when you put Quinnipiac's latest into the context of other recent polls, it's pretty clear that Warren is gaining everywhere.

Warren's national numbers are up since the September primary debate. She comes in with an average of 23% in debate qualifying polls taken after the debate. That's still behind Biden's 28%, but not by much. The trendline is what is important here. Warren was at 18% in an average of qualifying national polls taken in September before the debates.

The 5-point climb for Warren post-debate seems to be a continuation of a trend we've seen for months.

In an average of debate qualifying polls taken before the first set of debates in June, Warren was 12%. That rose to 16% in July. In other words, Warren's increasing numbers are the result not of one moment but of many."

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are virtually deadlocked in a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new national poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University.

The poll shows Warren at 27% and Biden at 25% among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, and is the first major national poll to show Warren in this strong a position since polling in Iowa and New Hampshire also found the two knotted at the top of the field. Although the difference between the candidates' numbers is within the poll's margin of error, the Massachusetts Democrat's new ranking is the first time a candidate other than the former vice president has topped the pack since Quinnipiac started posing the question in March.

The two candidates also saw change in support from the poll's August results, when Biden was at 32% and Warren was at 19%.

The poll reflects a tightening Democratic race as well as Warren's increasing consolidation of the progressive vote and making inroads among black voters. Her support among that crucial demographic bloc has climbed dramatically in recent months, from 4% in July to 8% in August to 19% now. Biden's support among black voters, meanwhile, has dipped from 53% to 40% over the same time. The numbers signal a potential softening in a key base for Biden's campaign, as well as an ability for Warren to grow support beyond white college-educated liberals.

In the new poll, Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (16%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (7%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%). All other candidates got 2% or lower in the poll.

Coulter, the author of “Resistance Is Futile!: How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind,” told Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event that it was “very suspicious” how specifics about new U.S.-Mexico border wall construction was not readily made available to the public.

“It’s very suspicious that we can’t get a straight answer from them on is any new wall being built where there was nothing before?” Coulter said. “Now admittedly I’ve seen about 50 miles on a 3,000-mile border, so who cares? Fifty miles does nothing when you have a 3,000-mile border. They were crappy little fences. Any little car or a person can get past it. But there was a fence and should we create a real fence there? Yes, definitely – an improvement. But it does make a difference is if they created real wall where there was nothing before. It shows that they have the building permits, that there is no EPA problem with disturbing a snail darter – you’re actually doing something new here, and you’ve gotten the go-ahead. And I believe the answer to that is ‘no’ because every time we get a straight answer, the answer is ‘no.’”

She recounted an effort relayed to her by someone having a difficult time getting answers about progress on wall construction.

“Last I heard, one of our friends was pressing the White House – he showed it to me – he sent it to me secretly the email thread, and it’s just hilarious,” she continued. “He keeps asking – ‘Yes, yes, yes but just so I can go back to Coulter and say ‘new wall is being built.’ Can you tell me if new wall is being built where it is being built? And they will not answer that question.”

As for the 2020 presidential election and what Trump’s potentially unfulfilled pledges pertaining to immigration issues might mean for its outcome, Coulter said a lot of next year’s election had to do with the Democratic Party opposition.

“The Democrats are doing everything they can to lose this election – not only by the candidates they’re running, not only by their positions,” she said. “They seem to that if Trump wants to protect America’s working class, then we hate America’s working class. If Trump doesn’t want illegal aliens, then we love illegal aliens. They’re taking the most absurd positions. We could get the Democratic Party to officially come out for pederasty if we told them, ‘You know, Trump is against pederasty. He really wants to go after the pederasts.’ That would be a plank in the Democratic platform. So we have that, and we have this nonsense with the call with the Ukrainian guy today.”

She said Trump’s 2016 election victory was a result of a combination GOP voters being energized and Democrat complacency.

“Leaving aside how crazy they are, this is the argument for why we should be nervous,” she continued. “It was kind of a miracle victory in 2016. Trump won by 80,000 voters basically spread out over four states in the industrial Midwest, i.e., white working-class voters, who have not voted in elections in 30 years. The Democrats were caught sleeping. They were so sure it was going to be a 46-state landslide for Hillary [Clinton]. You know there were a lot of Democrats who thought, ‘Ah, I don’t want to get up early. I’m just going to say I vote. She’s going to win anyway.’”

However, Coulter warned without action on the border wall and the so-called DREAMers, some of those Trump voters may not be there in 2020.

“[I] think there are a lot of Trump voters – I know there are besides me – they voted for him for the wall, for him to end the DREAMers,” she said. “So why hasn’t he done that? No, you can’t blame Mitch McConnell for that. You can’t blame Paul Ryan for that. You certainly can’t blame the Democrats. That was an unconstitutional executive order. Obama admitted it was unconstitutional for six years until he signed it. He kept telling all these left-wing activist groups, ‘I can’t grant amnesty on my own, that would be unconstitutional.’ Then he signed. Mitch McConnell won.”

“I think a fair number, and it doesn’t take that many, of Trump’s voters to be discouraged,” she added. “The one thing that is going to get them to the polls and is going to get Ann to the polls is the terror of having some lunatic like Elizabeth Warren elected.”

Bernie Sanders is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.

The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.

But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.

Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.

The new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.

Perhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders' 22%.

Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign's internal numbers painted a different picture. But even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away.

The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.

""It can't be this national campaign anymore. He's got to go on TV in Iowa. He's got to park himself in Iowa. He's got to show that he's the underdog fighting back,"" one of the aides told CNN.

The aide, who said that staff in Iowa has been ""screaming for Bernie to get on TV"" there, suggested that Sanders had overestimated his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I think there was initially this sense of, which candidates always want to do, they want to expand,"" the aide said. ""And so I think there was a sense in the campaign, probably a little bit wrongly, that he had an Iowa and New Hampshire base and was going to focus on South Carolina and Nevada and California and expanding. And I think what this is showing is he's got to just go back to basics.""

In an interview, campaign manager Faiz Shakir brushed off criticism that Sanders has spent too much time building a national brand, along with the suggestion that it had cost him in those early states. He pointed to Sanders' recent travels in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Colorado as evidence that the campaign is prepared for the long haul.

""We have four fingers in the air,"" Shakir said, referencing the start of the fourth quarter of 2019. ""We are ready to finish strong and, with that, comes an adjustment in the time and attention we pay to certain parts of the map and that includes Iowa and New Hampshire.""

But Shakir conceded that the shrinking calendar meant the campaign's margin for error was diminishing too.

""The arguments that we have framed up for the public, they need to come through clearly in this next period of time,"" he said of Sanders' efforts in Iowa. ""I think delivering that message is absolutely critical here in the fourth quarter. We have put ourselves in a position to do very well.""

A second senior aide also indicated that a move to focus more on Iowa and New Hampshire was imminent. That doesn't mean Sanders plans to eschew future trips to join striking union workers outside those states, as he did this week, but that Iowa, where he kicked off his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour on Monday, is soon likely to serve as a de facto base of operations.

Shakir also told CNN that Sanders, after parting ways earlier this year with the firm that made his ads in 2016, has personally decided to use the campaign's in-house team to produce his first round of television spots. The group, a fixture on the trail with the Sanders, began shooting elements for its first TV ad this week. Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have already begun to run ads in the state. Warren on Tuesday announced a planned eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We have a major advantage over other campaigns in that we have a lot more cash on hand,"" Shakir said of the campaign's approach to ad expenditures. ""You can use it correctly, or you can squander it. We are trying to stick to our strategy and make sure we are using our resources wisely.""

The back-and-forth over the campaign's media strategy has been pointed, but both of the senior aides who spoke to CNN touched on a more fundamental source of internal tension: the increasingly public disconnect between state level operations, most notably seen in New Hampshire, and the campaign's national leadership.

Those conflicts have been stoked, the aides said, by mostly lower level staffers, many of them Sanders loyalists from 2016 who have bristled at the 2020 leadership's tone and more exacting standards.

A progressive consultant familiar with the campaign's operation in New England told CNN that unsettled Sanders diehards pushed, successfully, for the ouster of former New Hampshire state director Joe Caiazzo, who was reassigned to Massachusetts. Caiazzo, who declined to comment, has been replaced by Shannon Jackson, a more familiar face who managed Sanders' 2018 Senate race.

According to a new poll from Monmouth released Tuesday, the campaign is facing increased headwinds in New Hampshire, where Warren -- as she did in Iowa -- has surged into the top-tier with Biden. Sanders, again, sits third with 12% to Warren's 27%.

The progressive consultant also said the campaign's internal politics were complicating efforts to broaden its appeal and forge alliances with outside grassroots groups.

""It's very confusing,"" the progressive consultant said of communications with the campaign. ""I have talked to people that hear from all of them -- that hear from (senior adviser) Chuck Rocha, that hear from (senior adviser) Jeff Weaver and that hear from Faiz. But my understanding is that if you want to get to Bernie, it's not Faiz that you go through. It's Weaver or (deputy campaign manager) Ari Rabin-Havt.""

For new groups only beginning to make sense of the progressive firmament, the process of sorting out the campaign hierarchy can be a turn-off -- especially when Warren's team has developed a reputation for proactively seeking out those less seasoned activists.

One of the senior Sanders aides conceded that the growing pains have been, at times, sharper than many expected. In 2016, the aide said, the absence at times of a coherent national operation meant that field staff had much more autonomy. The shakeup in New Hampshire, and lower level changes in Iowa, were largely instigated by internal arguments rooted in differing ideas about how to run a successful campaign without betraying the spirit of Sanders' first run.

Shakir conceded that there is a level of angst between staff at the local level and the national office. But he insisted that the decisions being made are part of a desire to see the vision of the candidate executed.

In the end, he argued, the campaign team -- from top to bottom -- needs to trust in Sanders' judgment.

""We all take our leadership and follow the direction of Bernie Sanders and he drives the strategy, and the argument of how we are going to win people over,"" Shakir said. ""I think to the extent that there's other people on campaign who have different views, I respect and appreciate that.

""But ultimately I believe strongly that we all take our guidance from the top -- and he is the one driving this train."""

When asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" if he believed Giuliani was potentially criminally liable, Schiff said that ""If Mr. Giuliani was involved in a scheme to coerce a foreign government into giving dirt, manufacturing dirt, on President Trump's political opponent, then yes, that certainly can violate the law -- violate the criminal laws.""

""Do I have any confidence, hope or what not, that the Justice Department would be willing to investigate?"" he added. ""No.""

The Justice Department, Schiff said, ""made it clear they're not going to investigate this and they don't want anyone else to. The fact that they would so cavalierly dismiss this credible evidence and say it is not even worthy of us looking into is yet another affirmation that Attorney General Bill Barr believes that he exists to serve the will and interest of the President, not the presidency, and that's exactly what he's doing.""

Schiff's comments come the same day acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the Intelligence Committee about his handling of a whistleblower complaint that has set off a politically explosive week in Washington.

Importantly, some issues involving individual GM plants have been resolved or are close to resolution, the sources said.

That mostly leaves the so-called national issues, including those involving pay and benefits for GM's nearly 50,000 hourly workers. Those are typically the last to be settled before a tentative labor deal can be reached. The two sides have been talking about those national issues since formal negotiations started in July

A final agreement can come together quickly in a strike. Any tentative deal needs the approval of union members, though the strike could end before a vote.

""I don't want to get hopes up but there has been progress,"" said one person familiar with the talks.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) announced Tuesday that she is beefing up her presidential campaign as she surges in several primary polls across the country.

In a memo to supporters, campaign manager Roger Lau wrote the campaign will grow its presence in Flordia, Texas, California, Illinois, Maine, and Georgia, as well as hire additional staff to help support Democrats running in competitive state legislature races in Michigan and Minnesota.

“Remember: this election is about more than just beating Donald Trump — he’s just the worst symptom of a corrupt system,” Lau wrote. “If we want to make big, structural change, we need to make sure Democrats control the U.S. House and Senate and win important gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country,” explained Lau.

Further, the campaign said it hopes to increase resources for volunteers with a canvassing app to enable them to converse with voters.

“This is how we dream big, fight hard, and win. We’ve got a plan to make sure Elizabeth is the next president of the United States. And when she’s in the Oval Office — when our plans go from big ideas to reality with the help of this grassroots movement — I want you to know that you helped make it happen,” Lau continued.

The announcement comes as the Warren campaign readies an eight-figure ad buy in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada.

“At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election — by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,” Lau said of the television blitz.

Meanwhile, Warren has solidified her status as the frontrunner in the Democrat presidential primary contest this week, two newly-released polls show.

Politico reports:

Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a new poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support.

Though some polls show Warren pulling ahead of Biden in some early primary and caucus states, a Real Clear Politics polling average shows the Massachusetts Democrat still trails the former vice president by roughly ten percent."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has overtaken Joe Biden and zoomed into first place nationally, according to polling from the far-left Quinnipiac.

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

Civiqs surveyed 1,548 registered voters September 21-24, 2019, and asked respondents whom they would support in hypothetical general election matchups featuring the president and top Democrat presidential candidates.

“If the election for president of the United States were held today, and the choices were Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, who would you vote for?” the survey asked.

In that scenario, 48 percent of voters chose Warren, and 44 percent chose Donald Trump, taking her lead outside of the 2.8 percent margin of error.

The survey asked the same question, replacing Warren with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). While Biden also experienced a four-point advantage over the president – 47 percent to 43 percent – he did not earn as much national support as Warren, who edged him out by one point. It further signals an increase in the Massachusetts senator’s electability.

The poll found Sanders with a two-point advantage over Trump – 46 percent to 44 percent – and Harris tied with the president with 44 percent each:

Following a rally in Iowa, Warren was asked if she would ban the children of her vice president from serving on the boards of foreign companies — a reference to the scrutinized business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who was paid $83,000 a month while sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil corporation at the time that his father was in the White House.

Despite her anti-corruption agenda, Warren initially said “No” she would not allow her vice president’s children to serve on the boards of foreign companies, but she quickly backtracked the answer, saying, “I don’t know.”

As Breitbart News’s Haris Alic has reported, questions about why Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma in April 2014 have plagued the former vice president’s 2020 Democrat presidential primary bid.

Alic’s reporting notes:

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. [Emphasis added] Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma. [Emphasis added]

Breitbart News’s Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer has detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, how Hunter Biden had no experience with the oil and gas industry or the nation of Ukraine before joining Burisma while his father was vice president.

These Woke Puritans on the left claim to be all about racial sensitivity, about opposing white privilege, about not offending people of color. They’re so rabid they swarm to attack nobody high schoolers who wear “problematic” prom dresses, white college kids who wear dreadlocks, even children who trick-or-treat as an Indian chief or an Eskimo or a Mexican bandit or an Arab.

This is supposed to be the New Sensitivity, right?

We’re supposed to be “perfecting” our society into something more pure and decent, right?

Well, then, explain to me just how in the hell a kid in a sombrero is “problematic” and not a 70-year-old white woman who spent decades wearing the equivalent of “redface” to advance herself?

For decades, Elizabeth Warren committed the most audacious act of cultural appropriation I have ever seen in a national politician. For decades, Warren pretended to be a Cherokee Indian, and to this day, even though her DNA test proves she’s has no more native blood (and probably less) than the average white American, she still hasn’t admitted she is not part Cherokee.

To everyday Americans, it’s her cheating that galls us; it’s someone pretending to be someone she’s not as a means to gain an advantage that galls us.

The Puritan Wokesters, though, if they actually were who they say they are, if they actually stood for what they say they stand for, should be apoplectic over Cherokee Warren, because what she did is not only outrageous, is not only a privileged white woman stealing a cultural identity purely for mercenary purposes, but you also have to ask yourself how many real-life people of color were not hired or promoted or given an opportunity because Cherokee Warren had already filled that slot?

What more proof is there that the Woke Movement is a total fraud filled with partisan liars. Here Warren is surging in the Democrat primary to a point where the Democrat presidential nomination is probably hers to lose. The latest polls show her up in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two primary states, and so far she has paid zero price from the Woke Police for decades and decades and decades of cultural appropriation.

Look at it this way…

If your child dresses as a Cherokee Indian this Halloween, the Woke-tards will be coming after you and him.

But Elizabeth Warren can spend decades pretending to be a Cherokee Indian as a means to get rich and famous and powerful, and these same people refuse to utter a peep.

Trump authorized the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript” of his conversation with Zelensky on Tuesday.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” Trump said. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”:

….You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

The transcript does not provide a “smoking gun,” as Democrat candidates proclaim. Rather, it shows Trump asking the Ukranian leader to further look into the 2016 election meddling roots — something Democrats, given their self-described goals of ensuring election security, would be in favor of.

Trump said:

I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

Biden’s son was not mentioned until after the fact:

… I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

As the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel explained:

2)As to call transcript itself: Trump’s actual “favor” is that Ukraine look backward, to what happened in the 2016 election. This is a legitimate ask, since election meddling looks to have come from both Russia and Ukraine. — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019

4)It is actually Zelensky who brings up Rudy Giuliani—saying they can’t wait to “meet him.” And it is Zelensky who references “that investigation,” as he goes on to promise that “all investigations will be done openly and candidly.” — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019

6)Trump's several references to Giuliani are mostly to say what a great guy he is. He says he will have Giuliani and AG Barr call. He asks Zelensky to speak/work with both. — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019

8)Meanwhile, the IG back in August referred this to DOJ as potential violation of campaign finance law, based on whistleblower complaint.

The House Intelligence Committee released the complaint on Thursday, which detailed accusations from an anonymous “whistleblower” who did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The alleged “whistleblower” contends that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

However, as the transcripts of the conversation, which were released Wednesday, showed, Trump’s explicit use of the word “favor” was used in reference to Crowdstrike and the questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts. Biden and his son were not mentioned until later in the conversation. The transcripts show no quid pro quo or “pressure,” and the Ukrainian president confirmed such.

Nonetheless, Democrats – particularly 2020 Democrat candidates – are claiming that the “whistleblower” complaint is “explosive” in nature and contend that it proves Trump committed “crimes” in the White House.

Joe Biden (D), whose alleged corrupt practices remain at the center of the controversy, proclaimed that Trump “believes he is above the law” and attempted to convince Americans across the board that the Democrats’ latest investigation and impeachment effort is not a partisan issue:

We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law. This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 26, 2019

“The whistleblower complaint is explosive,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote. “It paints a sobering picture of a president abusing his power for his own political gain against US national security interests.”

“Americans deserve to know the truth—that’s why an impeachment inquiry is so critical & our moral obligation,” he added:

“This is only the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior by Trump,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) assessed. “The House must thoroughly investigate Trump’s cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election”:

Like Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared that Trump “believes he is above the law” and predicted that he will “continue to commit crimes from the White House” until lawmakers take action.

“The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires,” she wrote:

Julián Castro (D) described the president as an “active national security threat” and said the complaint “exposed a criminal effort to extort political dirtywork from a foreign government, and a massive cover-up orchestrated by the White House”:

Both Castro and Beto O’Rourke (D) called on the House to cancel its scheduled recess to begin impeachment proceedings.

“As the whistleblower made clear: Every day Trump is in office, our democracy is less safe. We can’t wait to act,” O’Rourke added:

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) tweeted a clip from her Wednesday appearance on Anderson Cooper 360, urging Americans to refrain from viewing the latest Democrat effort to take down Trump as a partisan issue:

Cory Booker (D-NJ) are losing to some guy named Andrew Yang.

The four most recent national polls show Yang beating Booker in every single one. These same polls show Yang tied with O’Rourke in three, but shellacking him in a fourth.

Emerson has Yang at eight(!) points, Paddy with one point, and Booker with two.

Quinnipiac has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Morning Consult has all three sitting at three points.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Julian Castro, a former HUD secretary under President Obama, are polling even worse than Paddy and Booker.

The most interesting bit of polling news, though, is the total collapse of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is only polling a little better than Yang. But in the Emerson poll, which is only a few days old, he beats her eight points to four points.

In just ten weeks, Harris has dived from having 15 points of average national support from Democrat primary voters to just 4.9 percent, which is where she sits today, according to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls.

The Real Clear Politics poll of polls has Yang at 3.3 percent, which puts him ahead of O’Rourke at 2.4 percent, Booker at 1.7 percent, Klobuchar at 1.6 percent, and Castro at 1.3 percent.

Right now, the race for a 2020 Democrat presidential nomination is a three-way race… period. And it’s not even close.

In that poll of polls, former Vice President Joe Biden leads with 28 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA) with 22 and 17 percent, respectively.

The only positive thing you can say about Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s poll position is that he’s at the top of the bottom tier with 5.9 percent support, which only puts him a little ahead of Yang’s 3.3 percent. But…

In that Emerson poll, Buttigieg is behind Yang — eight to six.

The 44-year-old Yang has no political experience. He’s a private sector success, an entrepreneur, lawyer, and CEO. His big idea is to take away everyone’s private health insurance by forcing us into a government-run Medicare For All. He wants to confiscate guns and give everyone $1,000 every month as a guaranteed income, for some crazy reason.

In other words, he’s a crank.

But so are all the others.

The difference is that Yang has some charisma and a sense of humor. Unlike Booker and Paddy and Klobuchar and Castro and the Mean Little Mayor, Yang is likable and self-deprecating. And that is all it takes to beat a bunch of left-wing stiffs these days.

He smeared Ilhan Omar. He smeared San Francisco. He denied the existence of an obvious delay in military aid to Ukraine. He denied that the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. He confused champion mountain climbers by claiming that champion mountain climbers had tried and failed to climb his border wall.

President Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites.

Seventy-nine false claims is down from 90 the week prior to last , Trump's highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims.

Trump made 29 of last week's 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters.

Twenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats.

The most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay

Facing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay.

""I didn't delay anything,"" he told reporters . ""We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge.""

The money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was openly defending the delay he had said did not happen.

""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they're not doing it,"" he said -- which is also not true.

The most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again

This time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party

For sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump's story about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it.

Some of Trump's false claims are so bizarre that it's almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness.

Whatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party.

We must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the ""Democrat Party.""

He said last week, again, that he is not only using ""Democrat Party"" because it sounds worse but because that is the party's official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer ""Democratic Party,"" in which case he might call them that.

Yes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing.

Here is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update:

Google and the 2016 election

""Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two million to 10.5 million votes, and we won."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: That flawed study was conducted by a psychologist, not a Google employee or executive. You can read a full fact check on the study : That flawed study was conducted by a psychologist, not a Google employee or executive. You can read a full fact check on the study here

Joe Biden

Hunter Biden and the investigation

""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won't get a very large amount of U.S. money..."" -- September 21 tweet

""And, you know, he really made it a -- it was an offer. It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, 'I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters after Coast Guard briefing in Houston

Facts First: There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg.

Joe Biden and ""the case""

""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden's son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired.

Trump's allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

Joe Biden's previous comments

""This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did. And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again."" And: ""I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker : Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'""

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

Cokie Roberts

""I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional."" -- September 17 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: Trump had met Roberts, who : Trump had met Roberts, who died on September 17. As CNN's Brian Stelter noted , she interviewed him at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she asked him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question ""very nasty."")

Trump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent.

San Francisco, the ocean and needles

""We'll start with those two cities and we're looking at San Francisco, we're looking at Los Angeles. And we're looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there's tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they're going through what's called a storm sewer. That's for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don't have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it's a terrible situation. That's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them the notice very soon."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump's claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's claims ""ridiculous,"" saying in a statement that the city's sewer system ""ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants."" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay, told the Mercury News: ""In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported : ""Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 'We haven't had any (recent) problems with syringes,' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.""

Mountain climbers and the wall

""We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast : There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast contacted several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House.

The wall and San Diego

""You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, 'You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.'"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we : It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we reported at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump's repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall. San Diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to the proposal, and even the Republican mayor Trump was praising here, Kevin Faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed

The name of the Democratic Party

Trump said he calls the Democratic Party the ""Democrat Party"" not only because ""Democrat"" sounds worse than ""Democratic"" but because ""that's their name, the Democrat Party""; he said, ""Frankly, they should probably change it -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly : The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly insisted that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide.

A tweet on Ilhan Omar

Trump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump wrote , ""IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!"" -- September 18 tweet

Facts First: The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11. She was attending an event, called Breaking Concrete Ceilings, connected to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference.

Nuclear weapons

""Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, 'tippy-top shape.' Tippy-top. It's — we have new and we have renovated and it's — it's incredible."" --September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

""As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully -- and we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear. And the rest of our military is all brand new. The nuclear now is at a level that's it's never been before."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to : ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to cost more than $1 trillion . And experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the arsenal.

""I feel comfortable saying that the scientific studies to date have yet to provide any evidence that the nuclear arsenal was 'tired' or in any way at risk of being ineffective if called upon,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy.

""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal — but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Kemp, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, said that, with the exception of a hypothetical top-secret development she doesn't know about, ""everything is the same"" in the deployed arsenal ""as it was in January 2017"" -- aside from reductions the US made to fulfill its obligations under the New START treaty with Russia.

While ""the Trump administration has certainly requested and received increased funding for nuclear modernization,"" Bell said, ""this is a trajectory we have been on since 2010 "" -- and ""he hasn't really changed anything yet.""

""Budgets clearly demonstrate that we have spent enormous of money on nuclear modernization over the past decade,"" said Bell, who served in the State Department under Obama from 2010 to 2017.

A wall at the Democratic convention?

Talking about the large barriers he had visited at a California border site and is planning to erect elsewhere, Trump was asked if that's what he wants around the White House grounds. He said, ""No, but that's what the Democrats are putting up around their convention...They're building a big wall around their convention. Which they should do."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention. They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. ""It's not true,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN.

There will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California.

The Green New Deal and cars

Trump said that, under the Democrats' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric -- single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The congressional : The congressional resolution on the Green New Deal does not include any restrictions on the number of cars people could own or the number of miles they could drive.

The proposal calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.""

Bay of Pigs veterans

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The : Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The endorsement was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.)

Trump's Cuban American support in 2016

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%..."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses : Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses reported on by the Miami Herald when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received ""84%"" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%.

The Herald reported: ""Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations."" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump's best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%.

Military aid to Ukraine

Question: ""How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?"" Trump: ""Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. : Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid.

Trump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed by members of Congress and by people who were serving in the Ukrainian government this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn't actually happen until September.

The estate tax

""And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely

It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""

Oil prices

""Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: : Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate futures both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters reported

We can't fact check Trump's hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago.

The cost of the Mueller investigation

""House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent..."" -- September 16 tweet

""...they spent $40 million -- there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.

The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.

Here's a list of claims we've fact checked before in one of our weekly updates:

Immigration

Mexican troops on the border

""And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico's southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said , ""Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.""

Mexico's immigration assistance

""You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they're doing just the opposite. They've really been incredible."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. ""The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),"" Selee said. He added: ""The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border.""

Building the wall

""Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

""Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we're building it at a breakneck speed."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump's tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are ""many"" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction.

Democrats and the border

Trump said the Democrats have an agenda of ""open borders."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Human trafficking

""If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data.

Experts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. ""I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I've done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,"" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars.

Many victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration found that ""in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.""

Democrats

The Green New Deal, cows and planes

""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Democrats' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes.

Trump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A ""FAQ"" page that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to ""net-zero"" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.""

The FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector"" and ""working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.

Popularity and accomplishments

Special election in North Carolina's 9th District

Trump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down ""17 points three weeks ago,"" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Bishop was not down 17 points in any : Bishop was not down 17 points in any public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins.

When we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded ""Try harder"" -- pointing to a tweet by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14.

But 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine's tweet did not include any of that information.

Special election in North Carolina's 3rd District

Trump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District, ""was up a couple of points"" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One : Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One late poll had him up by 11 points.

The poll was in line with pundits' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.

Trump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but ""a couple of points"" is incorrect.

Suppression polls

""Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls, and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They're no different. They're suppression polls."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.

Veterans Choice

Trump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, ""They've tried to get that for 45 years. They haven't been able to get it. But I'm good at getting things."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Foreign and military affairs

Venezuela's wealth

""Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Venezuela was not one of the world's wealthiest countries 15 years ago.

The International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world's countries, but nowhere near the top.

""Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,"" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.

The war in Afghanistan

""We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they've ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about how ""hard"" the US is attacking the Taliban. ""Nineteen years of war,"" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says ""19 years.""

The Iran nuclear deal

""The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don't have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check : Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check here

ISIS fighters and Europe

""We have thousands of ISIS fighters and we want those fighters to be taken -- you're talking about, I think it's a big -- we have thousands of ISIS fighters that we've taken into -- we've defeated 100% of the caliphate. We are holding in various forms of prison. We're holding thousands of people. Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""They mostly come out of Europe."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: According to Trump's own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries.

Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Remains from North Korea

""We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back. We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them 'our heroes.' And they were our heroes. And they're coming back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort.

Trump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim here

Trade

Unions and the USMCA

Trump said of his USMCA trade agreement, ""Unions love it."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation : The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation says it will be a ""disaster for workers"" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.

Trade deficit with China

Trump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to ""to take out $500 billion a year"" or even ""more than that"" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was : Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

Aid to farmers

Talking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, ""And I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a : It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a second announcement that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government's tracking data as of September 24.

Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump said twice that China is ""eating the tariffs"" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue ""from China.""

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's economic performance

Trump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in ""57 years.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter growth rate was the : China's second-quarter growth rate was the worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

History of the tariffs

On three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received ""10 cents,"" ""100 cents"" or ""billions"" from China.

Facts First: The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we'll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.)

The Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year.

Economy and energy

Automotive investments

""My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. "" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Contrary to Trump's claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump's inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama's (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama's second term, according to the center's Bernard Swiecki.

Just two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump's presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision.

Trump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments. But none of these companies has announced a new US plant since Toyota and Mazda introduced the joint venture in early 2018, though Japanese automakers have made additional investments in existing facilities and Japanese truck company Hino Motors has built a truck-cab assembly plant in West Virginia.

""We know of no German or Japanese automakers currently looking to place additional car or truck assembly capacity in the United States,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's vice president of industry, labor and economics.

Energy independence

""Well, we have the Strategic — if you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody now."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters

""So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before."" -- September 18 tweet

""We're independent, as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is : While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted , the US also consumed more energy than it produced.

There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year.

""The US is still a net importer of crude and refined products, although the trend of declining dependence on imports should continue due to increased domestic production of unconventional oil and biofuels and growing investment in export infrastructure following the 2015 repeal of the crude export ban,"" said Josh Price, a senior analyst for energy and utilities at Height Capital Markets. ""Most of these factors preceded President Trump and have not been significantly altered by administration policies.""

The decrease in US imports and increase in exports began before the Trump administration. Obama presided over a boom in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.

""The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products. Executive policy has had little to do with the explosive gains, which are attributable to technology and price,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.

It's worth noting that the US will still be using large quantities of foreign energy even if it does become a net exporter next year. In other words, it will not be completely independent from foreign suppliers.

Energy production

Trump claimed four times that the US had only recently become the world's largest producer of oil and gas; in one of the claims, he added a message of self-congratulation in the third person: ""Thank you, Mr. President!""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under Obama, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Asian American unemployment

Facts First: Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was : Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 2.8% in August -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.

Overall unemployment

""Our job numbers for African Americans are the best in history. You saw the new ones came out; they're even better than they were two months ago. Hispanic, the best in history. Asian, the best in history. Overall, they're phenomenal. The best in 51 years. And I think we'll soon be historic on that one too."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

""We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""And unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years, and very soon, we think that will be broken to be a historic number."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The unemployment rate over this spring and summer -- 3.7% in each of June, July and August, 3.6% in each of April and May -- has been the lowest since December 1969, slightly less than 50 years ago; all of these rates were well off the record 2.5%, set in 1953.

The dollar

""Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER!"" -- September 16 tweet

Facts First: The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check : The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Women's unemployment

Trump said at his New Mexico rally that unemployment numbers for women were the best in ""71 years.""

Facts First: This was his usual slight exaggeration. The rate this summer has been the lowest since 1953, 66 years ago.

Inflation

Trump claimed three times that there is ""no inflation."" Facts First: There is inflation: 1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Prescription drug prices

Trump claimed that last year was ""the first year in 51 years where prices went down"" for prescription drugs. -- September 16 exchange w with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check : This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures.

Pre-existing conditions

""And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Republicans will always do that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass : This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass bills that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are now trying to get the courts to declare Obamacare void, without a plan to replace those pre-existing protections if their lawsuit succeeds.

Air quality

""And I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country?"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""President Obama said they (prisoners at Guantanamo Bay) were going to be totally completed and emptied out by the time he left office. And very much like judges, where, as you know, I ended up with 138 slots, you had a situation where that wasn't cleaned out."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges, including court of appeals judges, because President Obama did us a great favor. when I came in, I said, 'I assume I have no judges to appoint.' 'No sir, you have 138 judges.' 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not enter office with 138 judicial vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the confirmation of many of Obama's judicial nominees late in his term; Obama obviously didn't intend to ""hand"" vacancies to Trump."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fears the Democrat-led House impeachment effort could lead President Trump to ultimately claim vindication, he told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday the launch of an official impeachment inquiry, using the whistleblower complaint as a launching point. This follows months of far-left “Squad” members pushing impeachment and Pelosi’s continuous stiff-arming of such efforts.

“I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,” Pelosi announced at a Capitol Hill press conference.

“I am directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,” she said.

“The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law,” she continued, citing the Founding Fathers.

“Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote that times have found us, that times found them to fight for and establish our democracy,” she added. “The times have found us today”:

Nancy Pelosi: ""Therefore today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" pic.twitter.com/HyHKD39N7M — Axios (@axios) September 24, 2019

Several 2020 Democrat candidates called for the inquiry prior to Pelosi’s announcement.

“This isn’t a partisan issue—or shouldn’t be,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) tweeted. “When the president of the United States is working with other countries to interfere with our elections, we should begin impeachment proceedings.”

“It was true when I said it in 2017 running for Senate in Texas and it’s still true today: President Trump should be impeached,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) added.

“The House must impeach. It must start today,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote.

Noticeably absent though, was Sanders. While he believes that “impeachable offenses” exist, he signaled that Democrats may be acting too hastily and would not say if he would support the impeachment effort if it made it to the Senate.

“Here’s the dilemma that you have,” Sanders told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, according to BuzzFeed News. “Now I don’t know — I’ll tell you that my gut is that the average Republican in the Senate and the House is totally intimidated by President Trump.”

“And at this particular point, I have my doubts, like you all. I have my doubts that any Republican, or very few, would vote against him,” he continued, detailing his fear. Sanders worries that – in the event that the impeachment effort gets passed on to the Senate – which would require a two-thirds majority (or 67 votes) – it would fail and Trump would claim vindication as a result.

“I know and you know what [Trump] will do: ‘I am vindicated! … I am vindicated!’ And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed.

“But what do you do when you have a president who has acted in an unconstitutional way? If that is the findings,” Sanders continued. “Again, I don’t want to judge it. I think that is the face. But there is a process that has to take place.”

Sanders reiterated that he believes there are impeachable offenses, and he has signaled such before, floating an inquiry in May:

It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 23, 2019

“I believe that there are impeachable offenses. That’s my view. But my view is not good enough,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed News.

“I happen to believe that there are grounds to do it. But you have to lay it out,” Sanders explained, refusing to reveal his thoughts on the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Fellow presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken her position on impeachment farther than Sanders, telling CNN’s Newsroom on Tuesday that impeachment would “further tear apart an already divided country.”

“Impeachment is something — that is a step that will divide the country and will be worse off for our country,” she said."

Warren, the Massachusetts senator and a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination, has been a frequent critic of corporate malfeasance.

In a letter sent to Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton on Thursday, Warren said that even though reforms were put into place after the 2008 financial crisis to increase oversight of the ratings agencies, ""the SEC and other federal agencies have neglected or delayed implementation of many of the changes.""

She said a big problem is that companies pay Moody's and S&P to rate their bonds.

""Under the issuer-pays model, bond issuers - like large financial institutions - pay the agencies for their assessments of the products they hope to sell, ultimately giving the rating firms an incentive to give better ratings, regardless of the risk, since bond issuers might otherwise go to their competitors,"" Warren wrote.

""Right now, I'd like to just see us do the Ukraine issue because it is so clear and it is such a clear violation of law,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in an interview in her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the day after the release of a stunning whistleblower complaint about Trump and his conduct.

""The President is asking for help against one of his political rivals and asking a foreign government for a thing of value for himself personally. That's against the law,"" she continued.

Warren's comments come as Democrats debate how broadly to draft articles of impeachment against the President. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats in a private meeting on Wednesday that she wants to focus on Trump's conversations with Ukraine, according to several sources involved in the discussions. A resolution that is more broad could make it more complicated to get the necessary votes on the House floor, according to multiple Democratic sources.

But some Democrats who backed impeachment earlier on said they want the focus of the inquiry to include findings of potential obstruction of justice, saying Trump shouldn't be let off the hook for allegedly trying to thwart former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe . Others say the inquiry should address Trump's involvement in alleged hush-money payments to prevent stories of his alleged affairs from coming out before the 2016 election.

The whistleblower complaint detailed various ways in which the whistleblower believed Trump sought to ""solicit interference"" from Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election, including by encouraging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig into Hunter Biden's past. It also laid out an alleged pattern of efforts by the White House to cover up those attempts.

The White House released a transcript of a call between Trump and Zelensky, showing Trump repeatedly pushing his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son. The transcript has drawn further scrutiny because it had been moved to a highly secure server. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

""They didn't leave that transcript in the regular course of transcripts of phone calls with foreign leaders. Why? Because it wasn't a regular call,"" Warren said. ""It was a call that violated the law. And so their immediate instinct is: Let's block it out. Let's make sure nobody can see it. Let's cover it up.""

On whether she believes any Senate Republicans would vote to convict Trump, Warren answered: ""I don't know.""

""I think everyone in Congress should be called on to vote,"" she added. ""Everyone who took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then they should have to live with that vote forever.""

Warren, who has risen in recent polls and is running neck-and-neck with Joe Biden, said she hoped the impeachment process could be wrapped up before voting in the Democratic primary begins in February. She has called on the House to begin impeachment proceedings since April after the release of Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Asked whether Hunter Biden's business dealings should be off limits in the 2020 campaign, Warren pivoted back to Trump.

""I believe that this issue is about Donald Trump and that's where we need to keep our focus,"" she said. ""He is the President of the United States and he has solicited a foreign government interfering in our 2020 election. That is a threat to democracy and it is a threat to our Constitution. That's where we need to focus.""

Warren also told CNN on Friday that she worries for the safety of the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown to the public. She said Trump and his administration are ""doing their best to try to cover this up and discredit anyone who's trying to get to the truth.""

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Thursday testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint and defended the whistleblower, saying the whistleblower ""did the right thing.""

More than half of the House of Representatives now supports an inquiry, after Pelosi announced Tuesday a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump."

Coulter, the author of “Resistance Is Futile!: How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind,” told Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event that it was “very suspicious” how specifics about new U.S.-Mexico border wall construction was not readily made available to the public.

“It’s very suspicious that we can’t get a straight answer from them on is any new wall being built where there was nothing before?” Coulter said. “Now admittedly I’ve seen about 50 miles on a 3,000-mile border, so who cares? Fifty miles does nothing when you have a 3,000-mile border. They were crappy little fences. Any little car or a person can get past it. But there was a fence and should we create a real fence there? Yes, definitely – an improvement. But it does make a difference is if they created real wall where there was nothing before. It shows that they have the building permits, that there is no EPA problem with disturbing a snail darter – you’re actually doing something new here, and you’ve gotten the go-ahead. And I believe the answer to that is ‘no’ because every time we get a straight answer, the answer is ‘no.’”

She recounted an effort relayed to her by someone having a difficult time getting answers about progress on wall construction.

“Last I heard, one of our friends was pressing the White House – he showed it to me – he sent it to me secretly the email thread, and it’s just hilarious,” she continued. “He keeps asking – ‘Yes, yes, yes but just so I can go back to Coulter and say ‘new wall is being built.’ Can you tell me if new wall is being built where it is being built? And they will not answer that question.”

As for the 2020 presidential election and what Trump’s potentially unfulfilled pledges pertaining to immigration issues might mean for its outcome, Coulter said a lot of next year’s election had to do with the Democratic Party opposition.

“The Democrats are doing everything they can to lose this election – not only by the candidates they’re running, not only by their positions,” she said. “They seem to that if Trump wants to protect America’s working class, then we hate America’s working class. If Trump doesn’t want illegal aliens, then we love illegal aliens. They’re taking the most absurd positions. We could get the Democratic Party to officially come out for pederasty if we told them, ‘You know, Trump is against pederasty. He really wants to go after the pederasts.’ That would be a plank in the Democratic platform. So we have that, and we have this nonsense with the call with the Ukrainian guy today.”

She said Trump’s 2016 election victory was a result of a combination GOP voters being energized and Democrat complacency.

“Leaving aside how crazy they are, this is the argument for why we should be nervous,” she continued. “It was kind of a miracle victory in 2016. Trump won by 80,000 voters basically spread out over four states in the industrial Midwest, i.e., white working-class voters, who have not voted in elections in 30 years. The Democrats were caught sleeping. They were so sure it was going to be a 46-state landslide for Hillary [Clinton]. You know there were a lot of Democrats who thought, ‘Ah, I don’t want to get up early. I’m just going to say I vote. She’s going to win anyway.’”

However, Coulter warned without action on the border wall and the so-called DREAMers, some of those Trump voters may not be there in 2020.

“[I] think there are a lot of Trump voters – I know there are besides me – they voted for him for the wall, for him to end the DREAMers,” she said. “So why hasn’t he done that? No, you can’t blame Mitch McConnell for that. You can’t blame Paul Ryan for that. You certainly can’t blame the Democrats. That was an unconstitutional executive order. Obama admitted it was unconstitutional for six years until he signed it. He kept telling all these left-wing activist groups, ‘I can’t grant amnesty on my own, that would be unconstitutional.’ Then he signed. Mitch McConnell won.”

“I think a fair number, and it doesn’t take that many, of Trump’s voters to be discouraged,” she added. “The one thing that is going to get them to the polls and is going to get Ann to the polls is the terror of having some lunatic like Elizabeth Warren elected.”

""To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,"" the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party's fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

Twelve candidates have said they surpassed the polling and contribution thresholds outlined by the DNC to receive an invitation to participate in the debate: former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, businessman Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

At this time, no other candidate appears close to reaching the polling and fundraising thresholds by the October 1 deadline. To receive an invitation to the debate, candidates need a to meet a 2% polling threshold in four DNC-approved polls and at least 130,000 unique donors, including 400 donors per state from at least 20 states, to qualify.

""We ask that you to immediately reverse course and heed the recommendation of top US military officials and faith leaders to open our doors to eligible refugees from all corners of the world,"" the letter reads. ""A generous US refugee policy spares tens of thousands from terrible fates.""

The letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ed Markey, comes on the heels of the State Department's report to Congress that proposed a refugee cap -- which dictates how many refugees may be admitted to the US -- to 18,000 for fiscal year 2020, which begins next week.

Under Trump, the administration has slowly chipped away at the refugee cap. The ceiling for fiscal year 2019 stands at 30,000, which, at the time, was the lowest level since 1980.

The State Department announced the proposed refugee ceiling Thursday as part of a larger number of combined refugee and asylum claims expected for the next fiscal year.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The possible super PAC is far from operational, but Larry Rasky, a former Biden aide, has led the effort to stand up an outside group that he believes would help the former vice president rebut attacks that could impact Biden's standing in the crowded and contentious Democratic primary. While Biden is still seen as a front-runner in the race, recent polling has shown his once-large lead slipping as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren rises in the field

""For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,"" Rasky said. He added that he has begun to think ""the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we'd need to fight this.""

""The campaign is fighting a war on two fronts -- the primary and the general election -- at the same time. They certainly need all the support they can get.""

News of the super PAC, which was first reported by The New York Times , was not welcome inside Biden's campaign. Biden's team, from the outset of his presidential bid, has said they would disavow any outside spending on the former vice president's behalf. This case is no different. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden, reiterated Friday that the campaign would reject any help from outside super PACs.

""The attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,"" Ducklo said. ""Which is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs. That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.""

A source familiar with the internal Biden campaign strategy, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the outside effort, put a finer point on it.

""The campaign had its best week of fundraising since the second week after launching, and it would be impossible to miss from anywhere on earth that Donald Trump is panicked about Joe Biden,"" the source said. ""The campaign doesn't need or want this effort, and anyone engaging in it doesn't have its best interests at heart.""

Rasky said he expected that his prospective effort would be disavowed by the campaign, but he and others still believe the outside group is needed to rebut attacks leveled by Trump and other Republicans.

""We are dead serious about the need to do it,"" Rasky said. ""But we are also mindful of the campaign's position and the Vice President's expressed desire not to have one. That is a lot for us to ponder.""

Biden's campaign is not the first to have a super PAC considering spending on its behalf. A super PAC ran ads in support of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee during his now-ended presidential bid. And top Democratic donors considered launching a super PAC to help New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker earlier this year. Booker did not back the effort.

A source close to the possible super PAC said that while its focus would be to respond to attacks from Trump and other Republicans, they would not rule out responding to Democratic attacks on Biden.

""That's not what it is for,"" the source said, ""but if Biden is attacked, we need to defend him."""

""Do I have any confidence, hope or what not, that the Justice Department would be willing to investigate?"" he added. ""No.""

The Justice Department, Schiff said, ""made it clear they're not going to investigate this and they don't want anyone else to. The fact that they would so cavalierly dismiss this credible evidence and say it is not even worthy of us looking into is yet another affirmation that Attorney General Bill Barr believes that he exists to serve the will and interest of the President, not the presidency, and that's exactly what he's doing.""

Schiff's comments come the same day acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the Intelligence Committee about his handling of a whistleblower complaint that has set off a politically explosive week in Washington.

Civiqs surveyed 1,548 registered voters September 21-24, 2019, and asked respondents whom they would support in hypothetical general election matchups featuring the president and top Democrat presidential candidates.

“If the election for president of the United States were held today, and the choices were Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, who would you vote for?” the survey asked.

In that scenario, 48 percent of voters chose Warren, and 44 percent chose Donald Trump, taking her lead outside of the 2.8 percent margin of error.

The survey asked the same question, replacing Warren with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). While Biden also experienced a four-point advantage over the president – 47 percent to 43 percent – he did not earn as much national support as Warren, who edged him out by one point. It further signals an increase in the Massachusetts senator’s electability.

The poll found Sanders with a two-point advantage over Trump – 46 percent to 44 percent – and Harris tied with the president with 44 percent each:

“I wanted to give you call just to say thank you. I’m glad we’re going to be in this fight together side by side. I love the endorsement and for all the right reasons,” Warren said.

“Thank you so much. Well you know I have to tell you,” he began, telling Warren when he began to realize that she was the candidate for him.

“It was at the last debates and I was like ‘this health insurance industry is a f*cking racket,” he said.

“It felt right,” Warren said as she pounded her chest.

“That’s why we’ve got to do it. Because it is right. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. Not just for some of us. For all of us,” Warren said.

“I’m so excited to be shoulder to shoulder with you too. I can’t believe you called,” Van Ness gushed. “Let me know how I can be of service. I really want to help.”

“Yep. Were going to do it together,” Warren said to an awkward pause and filling in the silence by telling him to “be strong.”

“Go save America,” Van Ness said, before pivoting the conversation and telling Warren that they must get rid of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) because “he’s the worst.”

“Like we also really got to get that Mitch out of there because regardless of what – I mean Mitch McConnell, he’s the worst,” he said.

“We got to take the Senate. We’re going to take Congress back,” he continued, quickly correcting himself, as Democrats already possess a House majority.

“Well we already have Congress,” he said, adding, “and then we got to get you in the White House, and we’re just going to sort everything out.”

“So you go Save America, I’m going to keep doing these interviews, and I can’t believe you took the time to talk to me and I’ll talk to you soon,” he added.

“Ok, talk to you soon. Be strong out there,” Warren said.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday refused to say if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families, dodging the question and instead claiming people care more about overall “costs.”

Warren spoke to NBC News’ Ali Vitali, who asked the Massachusetts senator if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families– a question Warren has faced several times before on both the debate stage and campaign trail. Once again, Warren did not answer the question, instead claiming that families care more about overall “costs”:

“So one of the things that a few of your opponents were talking about late last week really was this idea of middle class taxes in healthcare. So yes or no– should middle class Americans expect their taxes to go up under a Medicare for All system?” Vitali asked.

“You may remember that I’ve spent a big chunk of my life studying why middle class families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is health care,” Warren said, repeating one of her routine talking points.

“The problem is its total cost for these families, so it’s what you pay in premiums. It’s also what you paying co-pays to see a doctor, or sorry that doctor is out of network so you’ve got to pay for the whole thing,” she explained.

Because of that, Warren suggested that Americans need to change the way they view the system:

People keep reaching into their pockets and reaching into their pockets even when they have health insurance, so how we have to think about this system is yes we should expect that for giant corporations and very wealthy individuals, costs will go up, but for middle class families – for hardworking people – the costs are going to go down.

“But that’s not the same as taxes not going up,” Vitali pointed out.

Warren did not dismiss Vitali’s assertion but argued that families care more about overall “costs,” regardless of increased taxes.

“What matters to families is costs,” Warren said.

Warren faced the same question during the Democrat debate in Houston, Texas, and repeated the same lines about total “cost.”

“What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets, what’s going to happen in their budgets, and the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations,” she said.

“But for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down, and that’s how it should work under Medicare for All,” she added, refusing to ultimately say if middle class taxes would go up, regardless of overall “costs.”

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) went after Warren for repeatedly refusing to answer the question.

“Senator Warren is known for being straightforward, and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we’ve seen that repeatedly,” he told CNN’s The Lead last week.

“I think that if you are proud of your plan and it’s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,” he continued.

“And I think it’s puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question, of whether her plan and Senator Sanders’ plan will raise middle-class taxes is yes, why you wouldn’t just say so and then explain why you think that’s the better way forward,” he added."

Warren said that Americans need to phase out structures that “have any carbon emissions” by 2028 and said the same of cars, calling to halt emission-producing vehicles by 2030.

“We need to say by 2028, we’re not going to do any more buildings and houses that have any carbon emissions,” she declared. “By 2030, no more cars with carbon emissions, and by 2035 no more production of electricity that has carbon emissions”:

Warren unveiled her $3 trillion climate change plan – inspired by Gov. Jay Inslee (D) – in September. The plan touts the same goals she outlined in her Keene stump speech, calling for “zero-carbon pollution for all new commercial and residential buildings” by 2028, “zero emissions for all new light-duty passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks, and all buses” by 2030, and “100% renewable and zero-emission energy in electricity generation, with an interim target of 100% carbon-neutral power” by 2030.

As Breitbart News’s Jerome Hudson detailed in his book 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know, carbon emissions from energy usage in U.S. are the lowest since 1992. Additionally, the U.S. reduced its greenhouse gas output by 2.7 percent in 2017 – President Trump’s first year in office – according to a report from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released last fall."

Despite her anti-corruption agenda, Warren initially said “No” she would not allow her vice president’s children to serve on the boards of foreign companies, but she quickly backtracked the answer, saying, “I don’t know.”

As Breitbart News’s Haris Alic has reported, questions about why Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma in April 2014 have plagued the former vice president’s 2020 Democrat presidential primary bid.

Alic’s reporting notes:

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. [Emphasis added] Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma. [Emphasis added]

Breitbart News’s Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer has detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, how Hunter Biden had no experience with the oil and gas industry or the nation of Ukraine before joining Burisma while his father was vice president.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) benefited financially from the existence of private prisons despite vowing to ban them on the grounds that they are “profiteering off cruelty,” a report from the Washington Free Beacon revealed.

Warren pledged in June to ban private immigration centers and private prisons, detailing the vow in a Medium post.

“There should be no place in America for profiting off putting more people behind bars or in detention,” Warren wrote:

We didn’t get here by chance. Washington works hand-in-hand with private prison companies, who spend millions on lobbyists, campaign contributions, and revolving-door hires — all to turn our criminal and immigration policies into ones that prioritize making them rich instead of keeping us safe.

“That’s why I will shut down the use of federal private detention facilities by ending all contracts that the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service have with private detention providers,” Warren continued, accusing private prisons of engaging in “exploitation, plain and simple.”

She even implicated the Trump administration, accusing it of luring in private prison companies, which “saw their chance to run the same playbook for our immigration system.”

Despite those pleas, Warren has benefited financially from the existence of private prisons.

According to the Free Beacon, Warren invested tens of thousands of dollars — $50,000 — in a Vanguard Group fund which “owned hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares in leading private prison companies. While she sold her stakes in that fund in 2013, the Free Beacon noted that it was “the largest shareholder of America’s largest private prison corporation” at the time.

The Free Beacon reported:

Warren invested in Vanguard Target Retirement 2025—a retirement account run by the Vanguard Group, an investment management company—which in turn invested more than 30 percent of its money in Vanguard’s domestic stock index fund. Vanguard was the top shareholder of Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), and one of the largest of GEO Group, both private prison companies, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Vanguard owned more than 12 million CCA shares and nearly 9 million GEO Group shares, which were worth roughly $456 million and $216 million, respectively, in March 2013. CCA, now called CoreCivic, was already the country’s largest owner of private prisons in 2013, according to an annual report. The company owned or controlled more than 50 correctional or detention facilities in the country, “with a total design capacity of approximately 86,000 beds in 20 states and the District of Columbia.” GEO Group is also one of the largest private prison providers in the country with 66 prison facilities across the world as of 2013. The two companies also operate many Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities for illegal immigrants.

Warren’s investment in the fund stands in stark contrast with the presidential candidate’s accusatory remarks over the summer, in which she accused private prisons and the financial beneficiaries of “profiteering off cruelty.”"

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told late-night host Stephen Colbert on Thursday that his Medicare for All proposal is far from free and Americans making over $29,000 will see their taxes raised to pay for it.

Sanders has been a vocal proponent of Medicare for All, which — by some estimates — could cost over $60 trillion over a decade. Colbert asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) last week if Medicare for All would result in higher taxes for middle class Americans, and he posed the same question to Sanders on Thursday.

“Senator Warren was on here last week and I asked her about her plans for Medicare for All, and I’m going to ask you the question that I asked her … at the risk of being accused of trumpeting Republican talking points,” Colbert said.

“Is there an increase in taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All, or rather, where would the tax burden go to pay for that?” the CBS host asked.

Sanders initially issued a similar answer to Warren, who repeatedly talked about overall “costs” rather than increased taxation itself.

“Under my legislation — 15 co-sponsors I believe in the Senate now — nobody in America will pay any more premiums,” Sanders said. “No more co-payments, gone. No more out-of-pocket expenses, gone. Nobody will go bankrupt… because of medical bills, that is gone.”

“Nobody in America under my bill will pay more than $200 a year in total for their prescription drugs,” he continued.

However, the socialist senator admitted that health care is not “free.”

“Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not. So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person’s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes,” Sanders explained, essentially admitting that taxes will go up on middle class families from there.

“Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,” Sanders said. “But if I say to you, that right now you’re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That’s gone.”

Sanders’ admission stands in stark contrast to Warren, who refused to explicitly state that Medicare for All will result in increased taxes for the middle class.

“Will their taxes go up?” Colbert asked after Warren refused to answer the question directly.

“I’ve listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence,” he said.

“Isn’t Medicare for All like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren’t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?” he asked.

“So, I accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that’s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered,” Warren responded, still refusing to say if she would raise taxes on the middle class to implement Medicare for All."

The House Intelligence Committee released the complaint on Thursday, which detailed accusations from an anonymous “whistleblower” who did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The alleged “whistleblower” contends that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

However, as the transcripts of the conversation, which were released Wednesday, showed, Trump’s explicit use of the word “favor” was used in reference to Crowdstrike and the questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts. Biden and his son were not mentioned until later in the conversation. The transcripts show no quid pro quo or “pressure,” and the Ukrainian president confirmed such.

Nonetheless, Democrats – particularly 2020 Democrat candidates – are claiming that the “whistleblower” complaint is “explosive” in nature and contend that it proves Trump committed “crimes” in the White House.

Joe Biden (D), whose alleged corrupt practices remain at the center of the controversy, proclaimed that Trump “believes he is above the law” and attempted to convince Americans across the board that the Democrats’ latest investigation and impeachment effort is not a partisan issue:

We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law. This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 26, 2019

“The whistleblower complaint is explosive,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote. “It paints a sobering picture of a president abusing his power for his own political gain against US national security interests.”

“Americans deserve to know the truth—that’s why an impeachment inquiry is so critical & our moral obligation,” he added:

“This is only the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior by Trump,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) assessed. “The House must thoroughly investigate Trump’s cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election”:

Like Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared that Trump “believes he is above the law” and predicted that he will “continue to commit crimes from the White House” until lawmakers take action.

“The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires,” she wrote:

Julián Castro (D) described the president as an “active national security threat” and said the complaint “exposed a criminal effort to extort political dirtywork from a foreign government, and a massive cover-up orchestrated by the White House”:

Both Castro and Beto O’Rourke (D) called on the House to cancel its scheduled recess to begin impeachment proceedings.

“As the whistleblower made clear: Every day Trump is in office, our democracy is less safe. We can’t wait to act,” O’Rourke added:

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) tweeted a clip from her Wednesday appearance on Anderson Cooper 360, urging Americans to refrain from viewing the latest Democrat effort to take down Trump as a partisan issue:

Cory Booker (D-NJ) are losing to some guy named Andrew Yang.

The four most recent national polls show Yang beating Booker in every single one. These same polls show Yang tied with O’Rourke in three, but shellacking him in a fourth.

The Economist has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Emerson has Yang at eight(!) points, Paddy with one point, and Booker with two.

Quinnipiac has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Morning Consult has all three sitting at three points.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Julian Castro, a former HUD secretary under President Obama, are polling even worse than Paddy and Booker.

The most interesting bit of polling news, though, is the total collapse of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is only polling a little better than Yang. But in the Emerson poll, which is only a few days old, he beats her eight points to four points.

In just ten weeks, Harris has dived from having 15 points of average national support from Democrat primary voters to just 4.9 percent, which is where she sits today, according to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls.

The Real Clear Politics poll of polls has Yang at 3.3 percent, which puts him ahead of O’Rourke at 2.4 percent, Booker at 1.7 percent, Klobuchar at 1.6 percent, and Castro at 1.3 percent.

Right now, the race for a 2020 Democrat presidential nomination is a three-way race… period. And it’s not even close.

In that poll of polls, former Vice President Joe Biden leads with 28 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA) with 22 and 17 percent, respectively.

The only positive thing you can say about Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s poll position is that he’s at the top of the bottom tier with 5.9 percent support, which only puts him a little ahead of Yang’s 3.3 percent. But…

In that Emerson poll, Buttigieg is behind Yang — eight to six.

The 44-year-old Yang has no political experience. He’s a private sector success, an entrepreneur, lawyer, and CEO. His big idea is to take away everyone’s private health insurance by forcing us into a government-run Medicare For All. He wants to confiscate guns and give everyone $1,000 every month as a guaranteed income, for some crazy reason.

In other words, he’s a crank.

But so are all the others.

The difference is that Yang has some charisma and a sense of humor. Unlike Booker and Paddy and Klobuchar and Castro and the Mean Little Mayor, Yang is likable and self-deprecating. And that is all it takes to beat a bunch of left-wing stiffs these days.

(CNN) Democrats might ask themselves why President Donald Trump is so intent on smearing former Vice President Joe Biden with phony scandals. Why isn't he doing the same to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's been climbing in the polls and has a shot at becoming the Democratic nominee for president?

The clear answer is that Biden, in his own words, could ""beat him like a drum"" -- and while Warren could win against Trump, her victory does not look like a resounding one, according to recent polls . In Trump's view, Biden poses the greatest threat and must be destroyed. And what better way than to wound Biden to the point that Democrats might think he's more trouble than he's worth?

Warren fans will point to national polls showing their candidate defeating Trump in a general election. But it's important to note that Warren has been largely spared from Trump's attacks thus far, and those polls don't take into account the campaign of calumny that would surely follow a Warren nomination. It's Biden that Trump clearly most fears.

It would not surprise me if foreign propagandists decided to take to social media to advance Warren's candidacy and hurt Biden's. This happened in 2016, when Russian trolls tried to turn fans of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. Many supporters took the bait and either voted for third party candidates or sat out the election.

Though polls suggest that Warren could defeat Trump by a few points, Biden still holds a more comfortable margin over the President. Let's not forget that poll numbers don't necessarily translate to an Electoral College victory. In 2016, Clinton lost the election even though she bested Trump by nearly 2.9 million votes nationally.

Biden is still a stronger bet against Trump in crucial swing states like Wisconsin and Ohio, compared to Warren. The most recent Wisconsin poll pitting Democrats against Trump has Biden winning by 9 points, while Elizabeth Warren is tied with the President. In Ohio, Biden is the only Democrat who can beat Trump. According to the most recent Quinnipiac poll from July, Biden leads Trump by 8 points, while Sanders and Warren both trail the President by 1.

President Trump has claimed Biden called for Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who was ""investigating his son."" But there is no evidence Hunter Biden was under investigation. The probe was into the business dealings of the owner of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

How should Democrats handle Trump's hatchet job on Biden's integrity? For starters, they should not get sucked into arguments over Biden's guilt or innocence. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Ukraine's current prosecutor general also came out in defense of the two. And making the case that the Trump children are profiting from their proximity to their father establishes a false equivalence that turns a flat-out lie into a ""what about the other side?"" discussion.

Meanwhile, other polls underscore weaknesses in the Warren campaign. For one thing, Warren seems to have a likeability problem, even in politically friendly states. A CNN/UNH Survey Center poll from July asked likely New Hampshire voters which Democrat they found most likeable. Biden and Sanders topped the list at 20% each, while only 4% chose Warren.

Then there are the policies. Warren endorses a Medicare for All health plan that would do away with private coverage, even though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows only 41% of registered voters supporting a system that eliminates private health coverage.

Biden's support for a government-run option in Obamacare is much closer to the public's preference. The poll found that 67% want an option to buy health coverage through a Medicare program, while keeping the possibility of private insurance.

Warren's call for decriminalizing illegal border crossings is also widely unpopular. She might be able to finesse that position in a general election campaign, but her views on immigration generally have ventured dangerously close to open borders.

Democrats might ultimately choose someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee. But it should be their decision and not a scared response to Trump's manipulation of the truth. There is a good reason he's so intent on crushing Biden."

385,"Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN",,A new Quinnipiac University poll out this week finds Sen. Elizabeth Warren with a 74% favorable rating and a 10% unfavorable rating among potential Democratic primary voters.,2019-09-28,CNN,Analysis: Warren's rising popularity has been limited to Democrats,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/28/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-popularity/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is Mork & Mindy closing credits .

A new Quinnipiac University poll out this week finds Sen. Elizabeth Warren with a 74% favorable rating and a 10% unfavorable rating among potential Democratic primary voters. Her favorable rating is up significantly from 61% in May , while her unfavorable rating is down from 16%.

This poll is one of many that suggests Warren's favorable rating has climbed since the beginning of the year.

Warren seems to have the hot hand in the Democratic presidential primary. She's challenging former Vice President Joe Biden for the lead in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally. These numbers show that at least part of her rise is because she's become more popular.

However, her growing popularity does not seem to be extending to outside the Democratic base.

Quinnipiac was kind enough to provide me with a crosstab of how non-potential Democratic voters (i.e. those who are not Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents) feel about Warren.

This month, she comes in with an 11% favorable rating and a 70% unfavorable rating among this group. That shouldn't be too surprising, given that, while some of this group are independents who don't lean toward either party, much of it is made up of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. We simply should expect Warren (or any Democrat) to struggle with this group.

What's interesting is the trendline. Back in Quinnipiac's May poll, Warren's favorable rating with non-potential Democratic primary voters was 8%, compared to an unfavorable rating of 66%. A CNN poll a month later put Warren with an 11% favorable and 66% unfavorable rating with this group.

Put another way, Warren has not really seen any improvement with non-potential Democratic primary voters over the summer, even as she has dramatically improved with Democrats.

Now compare Warren's numbers with that of her chief Democratic rival, Biden. He's become considerably less popular with Democrats. His favorable rating with potential Democratic primary voters from May to now has gone from 79% to 72% and his unfavorable has gone from 14% to 19%.

Among non-potential Democratic voters, the fall off has not been as dramatic. Biden's favorable rating remains steady at 22%. His unfavorable rating is up from 63% in May to 70% now.

Biden maintains a clear edge in net favorability (favorable - unfavorable) rating of -48 points versus -59 points for Warren among non-potential Democratic primary voters.

Biden's advantage here may explain why he does better in polls against Republican President Doanld Trump than Warren. A recent Fox News poll , for instance, had both Biden and Warren beating Trump -- but Biden more than doubled Warren's margin over the President (14 points vs. 6 points). He did so, in large part, because he did significantly better than Warren among non-Democratic primary voters.

UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT IS PUBLIC! It is ALL rumor, gossip, hearsay. NO PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OR EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING! I recommend reading it. In the alternative, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here is a picture that fully describes the whistleblower & his report. Mo pic.twitter.com/OYHmoRpUgv — Mo Brooks (@RepMoBrooks) September 26, 2019

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. on Thursday at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Brooks elaborated on his feelings about the allegations, which he said could be tied to 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) supporters.

“Elizabeth Warren in my judgment is just about guaranteed to be the Democrat nominee for president, OK?” Brooks said. “And there’s probably a number of people who support Elizabeth Warren that in part were either behind the disclosure of this information or are currently promoting it today in order to enhance Elizabeth Warren’s stature vis-à-vis, Joe Biden.”

According to the Alabama Republican, Warren meets the requirements of the modern Democratic Party in both identity and ideology.

“Let’s look at who Joe Biden is, OK?” he continued. “He is a white male who is a liberal. In today’s Democratic Party, that doesn’t cut it. On a sexist level, the Democratic Party basically says we want women, not men. And Joe Biden is a man. So that doesn’t fit that identity politics item that the Democrat Party fosters on the American people. Additionally, Joe Biden is a mere liberal. The Democrats of today insist on pure socialist.”

“And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, the third principle argument that they use is based on race,” Brooks added. “They are opposed generally to the election or nomination of Caucasians. And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, she’s claimed that she’s a Native American.”

Those criteria, according to Brooks are who Democrat voters want representing their party on the ballot.

“Those are their three themes, and those are the three themes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used to beat a 20-year white male liberal incumbent congressman in New York.”

Warren, the Massachusetts senator and a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination, has been a frequent critic of corporate malfeasance.

In a letter sent to Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton on Thursday, Warren said that even though reforms were put into place after the 2008 financial crisis to increase oversight of the ratings agencies, ""the SEC and other federal agencies have neglected or delayed implementation of many of the changes.""

She said a big problem is that companies pay Moody's and S&P to rate their bonds.

""Under the issuer-pays model, bond issuers - like large financial institutions - pay the agencies for their assessments of the products they hope to sell, ultimately giving the rating firms an incentive to give better ratings, regardless of the risk, since bond issuers might otherwise go to their competitors,"" Warren wrote.

""Right now, I'd like to just see us do the Ukraine issue because it is so clear and it is such a clear violation of law,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in an interview in her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the day after the release of a stunning whistleblower complaint about Trump and his conduct.

""The President is asking for help against one of his political rivals and asking a foreign government for a thing of value for himself personally. That's against the law,"" she continued.

Warren's comments come as Democrats debate how broadly to draft articles of impeachment against the President. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats in a private meeting on Wednesday that she wants to focus on Trump's conversations with Ukraine, according to several sources involved in the discussions. A resolution that is more broad could make it more complicated to get the necessary votes on the House floor, according to multiple Democratic sources.

But some Democrats who backed impeachment earlier on said they want the focus of the inquiry to include findings of potential obstruction of justice, saying Trump shouldn't be let off the hook for allegedly trying to thwart former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe . Others say the inquiry should address Trump's involvement in alleged hush-money payments to prevent stories of his alleged affairs from coming out before the 2016 election.

The whistleblower complaint detailed various ways in which the whistleblower believed Trump sought to ""solicit interference"" from Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election, including by encouraging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig into Hunter Biden's past. It also laid out an alleged pattern of efforts by the White House to cover up those attempts.

The White House released a transcript of a call between Trump and Zelensky, showing Trump repeatedly pushing his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son. The transcript has drawn further scrutiny because it had been moved to a highly secure server. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

""They didn't leave that transcript in the regular course of transcripts of phone calls with foreign leaders. Why? Because it wasn't a regular call,"" Warren said. ""It was a call that violated the law. And so their immediate instinct is: Let's block it out. Let's make sure nobody can see it. Let's cover it up.""

On whether she believes any Senate Republicans would vote to convict Trump, Warren answered: ""I don't know.""

""I think everyone in Congress should be called on to vote,"" she added. ""Everyone who took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then they should have to live with that vote forever.""

Warren, who has risen in recent polls and is running neck-and-neck with Joe Biden, said she hoped the impeachment process could be wrapped up before voting in the Democratic primary begins in February. She has called on the House to begin impeachment proceedings since April after the release of Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Asked whether Hunter Biden's business dealings should be off limits in the 2020 campaign, Warren pivoted back to Trump.

""I believe that this issue is about Donald Trump and that's where we need to keep our focus,"" she said. ""He is the President of the United States and he has solicited a foreign government interfering in our 2020 election. That is a threat to democracy and it is a threat to our Constitution. That's where we need to focus.""

Warren also told CNN on Friday that she worries for the safety of the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown to the public. She said Trump and his administration are ""doing their best to try to cover this up and discredit anyone who's trying to get to the truth.""

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Thursday testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint and defended the whistleblower, saying the whistleblower ""did the right thing.""

More than half of the House of Representatives now supports an inquiry, after Pelosi announced Tuesday a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump."

“Now the American people are being told we’re going to impeach the president … but guess what America, you can’t ask any questions of any of these people because they have certain protections,” Wright said during an interview on Fox & Friends Friday.

“That’s a sham; that doesn’t make any sense. That is an effort ultimately to kneecap … the president of the United States. This president or any other president, it is a horrific precedent,” he concluded.

The former CIA officer said that if the “whistleblower” is being used in an effort to try and remove President Trump, the individual should be forced to testify before Congress.

“You better stand up and do it publicly,” said Wright. He also criticized House Democrats for moving forward without gathering all of the facts.

“This isn’t about trying to get facts. We’ve already decided, as a partisan Democratic Party. I’m sorry to say, we’ve already decided we have to get rid of the president. We’re moving forward with it, irrespective of facts. That is clear.”

On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed, without evidence, that Russia was involved in the phone conversation in July between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way,” Pelosi said during an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe.

She continued:

We saw what the Russian disruption of our election last time, their interference, 100% confidence of the intelligence community, high confidence in the intelligence community, that the Russians disrupted our election. That was wrong. The integrity of our elections is central to our democracy. So what the president did in inviting outside intervention into our election, it goes beyond the pale.

On Saturday, President Trump criticized Democrats on Twitter for focusing all of their efforts on impeachment:

On September 21, Breitbart News reported that Congressional Republicans defended President Trump against the Democrats and the accusations made by the “whistleblower.”

“It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

“Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out — Whoa, different story! This seems to be the same kind of deal,” he concluded.

However, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said Friday that she hopes the impeachment inquiry will be completed before 2020 primary voting begins in February.

“Do you think it’s important that all of this be wrapped up before voting begins in February?” CNN’s political correspondent, MJ Lee, asked Warren on Friday’s broadcast of OutFront.

“Oh, I hope that it is. I’d like to see us get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible,” she replied."

Under Trump, the administration has slowly chipped away at the refugee cap. The ceiling for fiscal year 2019 stands at 30,000, which, at the time, was the lowest level since 1980.

The State Department announced the proposed refugee ceiling Thursday as part of a larger number of combined refugee and asylum claims expected for the next fiscal year.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The possible super PAC is far from operational, but Larry Rasky, a former Biden aide, has led the effort to stand up an outside group that he believes would help the former vice president rebut attacks that could impact Biden's standing in the crowded and contentious Democratic primary. While Biden is still seen as a front-runner in the race, recent polling has shown his once-large lead slipping as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren rises in the field

""For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,"" Rasky said. He added that he has begun to think ""the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we'd need to fight this.""

""The campaign is fighting a war on two fronts -- the primary and the general election -- at the same time. They certainly need all the support they can get.""

News of the super PAC, which was first reported by The New York Times , was not welcome inside Biden's campaign. Biden's team, from the outset of his presidential bid, has said they would disavow any outside spending on the former vice president's behalf. This case is no different. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden, reiterated Friday that the campaign would reject any help from outside super PACs.

""The attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,"" Ducklo said. ""Which is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs. That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.""

A source familiar with the internal Biden campaign strategy, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the outside effort, put a finer point on it.

""The campaign had its best week of fundraising since the second week after launching, and it would be impossible to miss from anywhere on earth that Donald Trump is panicked about Joe Biden,"" the source said. ""The campaign doesn't need or want this effort, and anyone engaging in it doesn't have its best interests at heart.""

Rasky said he expected that his prospective effort would be disavowed by the campaign, but he and others still believe the outside group is needed to rebut attacks leveled by Trump and other Republicans.

""We are dead serious about the need to do it,"" Rasky said. ""But we are also mindful of the campaign's position and the Vice President's expressed desire not to have one. That is a lot for us to ponder.""

Biden's campaign is not the first to have a super PAC considering spending on its behalf. A super PAC ran ads in support of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee during his now-ended presidential bid. And top Democratic donors considered launching a super PAC to help New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker earlier this year. Booker did not back the effort.

A source close to the possible super PAC said that while its focus would be to respond to attacks from Trump and other Republicans, they would not rule out responding to Democratic attacks on Biden.

""That's not what it is for,"" the source said, ""but if Biden is attacked, we need to defend him."""

Ford’s accusatory testimony – in which she accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a college party more than 30 years ago – was fraught with contradictions. Ford claimed that her friend, Leland Keyser, was at the party where the alleged assault took place. However, Keyser has been quoted denying any recollection of the alleged event.

“I don’t have any confidence in the story. Those facts together I don’t recollect, and it just didn’t make any sense,” she said, according to the New York Times’ Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly’s book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.

“It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she’s getting home,” Keyser said. “I just really didn’t have confidence in the story.”

Even Ford’s father reportedly supported Kavanaugh’s confirmation, despite his daughter’s unfounded claims.

Despite the pending questions, Ford has remained a heroic political figure for many on the left. She made Time Magazine’s annual “100 Most Influential People” list, which featured a profile written by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who praised Ford’s “sacrifice.”

“Her story, spoken while holding back tears, shook Washington and the country. Her courage, in the face of those who wished to silence her, galvanized Americans,” Harris wrote.

“And her unfathomable sacrifice, out of a sense of civic duty, shined a spotlight on the way we treat survivors of sexual violence,” she continued.

Harris praised Ford again on Friday in an op-ed published by Elle, calling for an impeachment inquiry into Kavanaugh.

“After allegations of sexual assault surfaced during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, I saw up close that the hearings and FBI investigation were not a serious pursuit of truth or justice,” she continued.

“We need to get to the truth about Kavanaugh. And I believe the best path to truth and accountability is through a formal impeachment process,” she added."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday posted a video of a phone call she had with Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness, thanking him for his recent endorsement.

Van Ness, who recently went public with his HIV diagnosis, told his 796k Twitter followers on Wednesday the moment he “knew” he was officially endorsing Warren for president.

“The moment I knew I was endorsing @ewarren was last month when I misplaced my HIV meds,” Van Ness wrote.

“It cost $3500 to replace them out of pocket with “amazing” plantinum level insurance. Healthcare shouldn’t be for profit ever, it’s a human right,” he added:

Warren was delighted by the endorsement and called to thank him, tweeting a video of their conversation on Twitter:

Thank you for your support, @jvn! Shoulder to shoulder, we’re going to fight for #MedicareForAll. No one should be able to make a profit off of denying people health care—and together, we’ll win. pic.twitter.com/8aF4Ut55jq — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 26, 2019

“I wanted to give you call just to say thank you. I’m glad we’re going to be in this fight together side by side. I love the endorsement and for all the right reasons,” Warren said.

“Thank you so much. Well you know I have to tell you,” he began, telling Warren when he began to realize that she was the candidate for him.

“It was at the last debates and I was like ‘this health insurance industry is a f*cking racket,” he said.

“It felt right,” Warren said as she pounded her chest.

“That’s why we’ve got to do it. Because it is right. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. Not just for some of us. For all of us,” Warren said.

“I’m so excited to be shoulder to shoulder with you too. I can’t believe you called,” Van Ness gushed. “Let me know how I can be of service. I really want to help.”

“Yep. Were going to do it together,” Warren said to an awkward pause and filling in the silence by telling him to “be strong.”

“Go save America,” Van Ness said, before pivoting the conversation and telling Warren that they must get rid of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) because “he’s the worst.”

“Like we also really got to get that Mitch out of there because regardless of what – I mean Mitch McConnell, he’s the worst,” he said.

“We got to take the Senate. We’re going to take Congress back,” he continued, quickly correcting himself, as Democrats already possess a House majority.

“Well we already have Congress,” he said, adding, “and then we got to get you in the White House, and we’re just going to sort everything out.”

“So you go Save America, I’m going to keep doing these interviews, and I can’t believe you took the time to talk to me and I’ll talk to you soon,” he added.

“Ok, talk to you soon. Be strong out there,” Warren said.

“Thank you, I will. You too,” he added with an enthusiastic “Ah!”

Van Ness is hardly the first supporter Warren has called to thank. The presidential candidate tweeted videos of personal calls she made to grassroots donors, thanking them for contributing to her campaign, on Friday:

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday refused to say if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families, dodging the question and instead claiming people care more about overall “costs.”

Warren spoke to NBC News’ Ali Vitali, who asked the Massachusetts senator if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families– a question Warren has faced several times before on both the debate stage and campaign trail. Once again, Warren did not answer the question, instead claiming that families care more about overall “costs”:

“So one of the things that a few of your opponents were talking about late last week really was this idea of middle class taxes in healthcare. So yes or no– should middle class Americans expect their taxes to go up under a Medicare for All system?” Vitali asked.

“You may remember that I’ve spent a big chunk of my life studying why middle class families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is health care,” Warren said, repeating one of her routine talking points.

“The problem is its total cost for these families, so it’s what you pay in premiums. It’s also what you paying co-pays to see a doctor, or sorry that doctor is out of network so you’ve got to pay for the whole thing,” she explained.

Because of that, Warren suggested that Americans need to change the way they view the system:

People keep reaching into their pockets and reaching into their pockets even when they have health insurance, so how we have to think about this system is yes we should expect that for giant corporations and very wealthy individuals, costs will go up, but for middle class families – for hardworking people – the costs are going to go down.

“But that’s not the same as taxes not going up,” Vitali pointed out.

Warren did not dismiss Vitali’s assertion but argued that families care more about overall “costs,” regardless of increased taxes.

“What matters to families is costs,” Warren said.

Warren faced the same question during the Democrat debate in Houston, Texas, and repeated the same lines about total “cost.”

“What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets, what’s going to happen in their budgets, and the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations,” she said.

“But for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down, and that’s how it should work under Medicare for All,” she added, refusing to ultimately say if middle class taxes would go up, regardless of overall “costs.”

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) went after Warren for repeatedly refusing to answer the question.

“Senator Warren is known for being straightforward, and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we’ve seen that repeatedly,” he told CNN’s The Lead last week.

“I think that if you are proud of your plan and it’s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,” he continued.

“And I think it’s puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question, of whether her plan and Senator Sanders’ plan will raise middle-class taxes is yes, why you wouldn’t just say so and then explain why you think that’s the better way forward,” he added."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told supporters during a campaign stop in Keene, New Hampshire, on Wednesday that Americans should phase out new homes, buildings, and vehicles that produce carbon emissions over the next 16 years.

Warren said that Americans need to phase out structures that “have any carbon emissions” by 2028 and said the same of cars, calling to halt emission-producing vehicles by 2030.

“We need to say by 2028, we’re not going to do any more buildings and houses that have any carbon emissions,” she declared. “By 2030, no more cars with carbon emissions, and by 2035 no more production of electricity that has carbon emissions”:

Warren unveiled her $3 trillion climate change plan – inspired by Gov. Jay Inslee (D) – in September. The plan touts the same goals she outlined in her Keene stump speech, calling for “zero-carbon pollution for all new commercial and residential buildings” by 2028, “zero emissions for all new light-duty passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks, and all buses” by 2030, and “100% renewable and zero-emission energy in electricity generation, with an interim target of 100% carbon-neutral power” by 2030.

As Breitbart News’s Jerome Hudson detailed in his book 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know, carbon emissions from energy usage in U.S. are the lowest since 1992. Additionally, the U.S. reduced its greenhouse gas output by 2.7 percent in 2017 – President Trump’s first year in office – according to a report from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released last fall."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) benefited financially from the existence of private prisons despite vowing to ban them on the grounds that they are “profiteering off cruelty,” a report from the Washington Free Beacon revealed.

Warren pledged in June to ban private immigration centers and private prisons, detailing the vow in a Medium post.

“There should be no place in America for profiting off putting more people behind bars or in detention,” Warren wrote:

We didn’t get here by chance. Washington works hand-in-hand with private prison companies, who spend millions on lobbyists, campaign contributions, and revolving-door hires — all to turn our criminal and immigration policies into ones that prioritize making them rich instead of keeping us safe.

“That’s why I will shut down the use of federal private detention facilities by ending all contracts that the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service have with private detention providers,” Warren continued, accusing private prisons of engaging in “exploitation, plain and simple.”

She even implicated the Trump administration, accusing it of luring in private prison companies, which “saw their chance to run the same playbook for our immigration system.”

Despite those pleas, Warren has benefited financially from the existence of private prisons.

According to the Free Beacon, Warren invested tens of thousands of dollars — $50,000 — in a Vanguard Group fund which “owned hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares in leading private prison companies. While she sold her stakes in that fund in 2013, the Free Beacon noted that it was “the largest shareholder of America’s largest private prison corporation” at the time.

The Free Beacon reported:

Warren invested in Vanguard Target Retirement 2025—a retirement account run by the Vanguard Group, an investment management company—which in turn invested more than 30 percent of its money in Vanguard’s domestic stock index fund. Vanguard was the top shareholder of Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), and one of the largest of GEO Group, both private prison companies, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Vanguard owned more than 12 million CCA shares and nearly 9 million GEO Group shares, which were worth roughly $456 million and $216 million, respectively, in March 2013. CCA, now called CoreCivic, was already the country’s largest owner of private prisons in 2013, according to an annual report. The company owned or controlled more than 50 correctional or detention facilities in the country, “with a total design capacity of approximately 86,000 beds in 20 states and the District of Columbia.” GEO Group is also one of the largest private prison providers in the country with 66 prison facilities across the world as of 2013. The two companies also operate many Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities for illegal immigrants.

Warren’s investment in the fund stands in stark contrast with the presidential candidate’s accusatory remarks over the summer, in which she accused private prisons and the financial beneficiaries of “profiteering off cruelty.”"

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL) discussed the possible motivations of the renewed push against Trump as it pertained to Ukraine.

“I think they’re trying to make the president look bad,” Aderholt said. “That’s one aspect of it – but also trying to appease their Democrat base on the other side. Now what is going to be interesting, I think, is see what in the next few days and next couple of weeks what we see this does to Biden because Biden is all wrapped up in this whole thing and his son Hunter. So, I don’t know how that’s going to have an impact.”

The Alabama Republican lawmaker said given the Biden son’s involvement in the saga, Biden could be eliminated from contention for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

“I think quite honestly Biden is out of the picture,” he continued. “I’ve said for quite some time now that I don’t think he will be the nominee. And I think with this recent thing he has implicated with his son that I think this assures he will not be the nominee.”

Aderholt went on to add that among his House colleagues, there is a consensus Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will be the nominee.

“Certainly, those on the left side of the party – they don’t like Trump obviously,” he added. “But they don’t really like Biden either. So, I think Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren – that’s who they would gravitate toward. I talk to a lot of my colleagues. I casually just ask the question about how they see this playing out. It seems like the consensus is that Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee.”

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told late-night host Stephen Colbert on Thursday that his Medicare for All proposal is far from free and Americans making over $29,000 will see their taxes raised to pay for it.

Sanders has been a vocal proponent of Medicare for All, which — by some estimates — could cost over $60 trillion over a decade. Colbert asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) last week if Medicare for All would result in higher taxes for middle class Americans, and he posed the same question to Sanders on Thursday.

“Senator Warren was on here last week and I asked her about her plans for Medicare for All, and I’m going to ask you the question that I asked her … at the risk of being accused of trumpeting Republican talking points,” Colbert said.

“Is there an increase in taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All, or rather, where would the tax burden go to pay for that?” the CBS host asked.

Sanders initially issued a similar answer to Warren, who repeatedly talked about overall “costs” rather than increased taxation itself.

“Under my legislation — 15 co-sponsors I believe in the Senate now — nobody in America will pay any more premiums,” Sanders said. “No more co-payments, gone. No more out-of-pocket expenses, gone. Nobody will go bankrupt… because of medical bills, that is gone.”

“Nobody in America under my bill will pay more than $200 a year in total for their prescription drugs,” he continued.

However, the socialist senator admitted that health care is not “free.”

“Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not. So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person’s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes,” Sanders explained, essentially admitting that taxes will go up on middle class families from there.

“Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,” Sanders said. “But if I say to you, that right now you’re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That’s gone.”

Sanders’ admission stands in stark contrast to Warren, who refused to explicitly state that Medicare for All will result in increased taxes for the middle class.

“Will their taxes go up?” Colbert asked after Warren refused to answer the question directly.

“I’ve listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence,” he said.

“Isn’t Medicare for All like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren’t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?” he asked.

“So, I accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that’s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered,” Warren responded, still refusing to say if she would raise taxes on the middle class to implement Medicare for All."

“We are here today because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton, and until the Republicans free themselves of hatred our country will suffer,” Pelosi said in the clip.

“They are driven by hatred,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) declared. “They hate Bill and Hillary Clinton so much, they will stop at nothing to bring him down.”

“Impeachment of a president is an undoing of a national election, and one of the reasons we all feel so angry about what they are doing is that they are ripping from us, they are ripping us under our votes,” Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said. “They are telling us that our votes don’t count.”

The flashback even features Joe Biden (D), who warned Congress to be careful and make “darn sure” that they are impeaching based on “principle not politics.”

Their remarks stand in stark contrast to their recent remarks.

Pelosi announced the formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump on Wednesday.

(CNN) Democrats might ask themselves why President Donald Trump is so intent on smearing former Vice President Joe Biden with phony scandals. Why isn't he doing the same to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's been climbing in the polls and has a shot at becoming the Democratic nominee for president?

The clear answer is that Biden, in his own words, could ""beat him like a drum"" -- and while Warren could win against Trump, her victory does not look like a resounding one, according to recent polls . In Trump's view, Biden poses the greatest threat and must be destroyed. And what better way than to wound Biden to the point that Democrats might think he's more trouble than he's worth?

Warren fans will point to national polls showing their candidate defeating Trump in a general election. But it's important to note that Warren has been largely spared from Trump's attacks thus far, and those polls don't take into account the campaign of calumny that would surely follow a Warren nomination. It's Biden that Trump clearly most fears.

It would not surprise me if foreign propagandists decided to take to social media to advance Warren's candidacy and hurt Biden's. This happened in 2016, when Russian trolls tried to turn fans of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. Many supporters took the bait and either voted for third party candidates or sat out the election.

Though polls suggest that Warren could defeat Trump by a few points, Biden still holds a more comfortable margin over the President. Let's not forget that poll numbers don't necessarily translate to an Electoral College victory. In 2016, Clinton lost the election even though she bested Trump by nearly 2.9 million votes nationally.

Biden is still a stronger bet against Trump in crucial swing states like Wisconsin and Ohio, compared to Warren. The most recent Wisconsin poll pitting Democrats against Trump has Biden winning by 9 points, while Elizabeth Warren is tied with the President. In Ohio, Biden is the only Democrat who can beat Trump. According to the most recent Quinnipiac poll from July, Biden leads Trump by 8 points, while Sanders and Warren both trail the President by 1.

President Trump has claimed Biden called for Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who was ""investigating his son."" But there is no evidence Hunter Biden was under investigation. The probe was into the business dealings of the owner of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

How should Democrats handle Trump's hatchet job on Biden's integrity? For starters, they should not get sucked into arguments over Biden's guilt or innocence. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Ukraine's current prosecutor general also came out in defense of the two. And making the case that the Trump children are profiting from their proximity to their father establishes a false equivalence that turns a flat-out lie into a ""what about the other side?"" discussion.

Meanwhile, other polls underscore weaknesses in the Warren campaign. For one thing, Warren seems to have a likeability problem, even in politically friendly states. A CNN/UNH Survey Center poll from July asked likely New Hampshire voters which Democrat they found most likeable. Biden and Sanders topped the list at 20% each, while only 4% chose Warren.

Then there are the policies. Warren endorses a Medicare for All health plan that would do away with private coverage, even though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows only 41% of registered voters supporting a system that eliminates private health coverage.

Biden's support for a government-run option in Obamacare is much closer to the public's preference. The poll found that 67% want an option to buy health coverage through a Medicare program, while keeping the possibility of private insurance.

Warren's call for decriminalizing illegal border crossings is also widely unpopular. She might be able to finesse that position in a general election campaign, but her views on immigration generally have ventured dangerously close to open borders.

Democrats might ultimately choose someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee. But it should be their decision and not a scared response to Trump's manipulation of the truth. There is a good reason he's so intent on crushing Biden."
407,"Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN",,A new Quinnipiac University poll out this week finds Sen. Elizabeth Warren with a 74% favorable rating and a 10% unfavorable rating among potential Democratic primary voters.,2019-09-28,CNN,Analysis: Warren's rising popularity has been limited to Democrats,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/28/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-popularity/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is Mork & Mindy closing credits .

A new Quinnipiac University poll out this week finds Sen. Elizabeth Warren with a 74% favorable rating and a 10% unfavorable rating among potential Democratic primary voters. Her favorable rating is up significantly from 61% in May , while her unfavorable rating is down from 16%.

This poll is one of many that suggests Warren's favorable rating has climbed since the beginning of the year.

Warren seems to have the hot hand in the Democratic presidential primary. She's challenging former Vice President Joe Biden for the lead in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally. These numbers show that at least part of her rise is because she's become more popular.

However, her growing popularity does not seem to be extending to outside the Democratic base.

Quinnipiac was kind enough to provide me with a crosstab of how non-potential Democratic voters (i.e. those who are not Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents) feel about Warren.

This month, she comes in with an 11% favorable rating and a 70% unfavorable rating among this group. That shouldn't be too surprising, given that, while some of this group are independents who don't lean toward either party, much of it is made up of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. We simply should expect Warren (or any Democrat) to struggle with this group.

What's interesting is the trendline. Back in Quinnipiac's May poll, Warren's favorable rating with non-potential Democratic primary voters was 8%, compared to an unfavorable rating of 66%. A CNN poll a month later put Warren with an 11% favorable and 66% unfavorable rating with this group.

Put another way, Warren has not really seen any improvement with non-potential Democratic primary voters over the summer, even as she has dramatically improved with Democrats.

Now compare Warren's numbers with that of her chief Democratic rival, Biden. He's become considerably less popular with Democrats. His favorable rating with potential Democratic primary voters from May to now has gone from 79% to 72% and his unfavorable has gone from 14% to 19%.

Among non-potential Democratic voters, the fall off has not been as dramatic. Biden's favorable rating remains steady at 22%. His unfavorable rating is up from 63% in May to 70% now.

Biden maintains a clear edge in net favorability (favorable - unfavorable) rating of -48 points versus -59 points for Warren among non-potential Democratic primary voters.

Biden's advantage here may explain why he does better in polls against Republican President Doanld Trump than Warren. A recent Fox News poll , for instance, had both Biden and Warren beating Trump -- but Biden more than doubled Warren's margin over the President (14 points vs. 6 points). He did so, in large part, because he did significantly better than Warren among non-Democratic primary voters.

Of course, we'll have to see how this week's impeachment news may shift these numbers. Biden's numbers could slink southward as Republicans attack him.

But for now, Biden's maintaining his electability edge over Warren."

At a CNN town hall in March in Jackson, Mississippi, she talked boldly about the enduring stain of chattel slavery and her plans to address lingering racial inequality.

A month later, she got a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference where she set the pace on black maternal health care policy. Jesse Jackson lavished her with praise, seeming to single her out after her speech at the Rainbow Push conference in June.

And at Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington, DC, in early September, she drew the largest applause of all the candidates, two of whom were CBC members. She has also grabbed endorsements from prominent black women, such as Roxane Gay.

Yet, Warren, whose campaign feels most like a movement, has struggled to translate that appeal to black voters on the ground. On the campus of a small historically black college here this weekend that was very much evident -- she only drew a handful of black voters in a crowd of about 1,000 people. Event attendance, particularly on a Saturday afternoon in 90 degree weather, is a very rough metric -- Biden's crowd at the same venue was mostly white as well. But it's clear that Warren, like Bernie Sanders before her, is struggling with black voters. She is all the rage on black twitter, not so much elsewhere. A new CNN poll has her lagging Biden in this state among black voters by 41 points -- she notches 4% among black voters. (Sanders gets 13%).

Asked Saturday about closing this gap and why she thinks it persists, she answered:

""The way I see this is that African American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now. They get out there and they fight for you. What I'm doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I'm in this fight. About what's broken and how to fix it and how we're building a grassroots movement to get it done. And it's not just one policy, it's everywhere. Education it is. It's about our historically black colleges and universities. It's about closing the black white wealth gap by canceling a lot of the student loan debt that's out there. It's there in health care to deal with the maternal health mortality rates that hit black women so much harder than any other group. It's about housing and attacking redlining straight on. I've got a lot of plans and what I want to do talk to people about all of them. Because ultimately we have a country that keeps working better and better for those at the top and isn't working for much of anyone else and I think we got a chance to change that.""

Her very specific plans are certainly breaking through with some voters. Casey McClure, who came with her mother and father to Warren's event here with very specific reasons why she backs the Massachusetts senator.

""I'm voting for Warren because I can't afford college anymore. I also like her plan for black women so we won't die so much in labor,"" McClure, 26, said. ""And she reminds me of Obama because she gives us hope.""

McClure said she is trying to convince her dad, Willie McClure, 65, to back Warren. He seems to lean-Biden because of the Obama connection, but is still making up his mind.

""I like Warren because of the fire she brings. What she's bringing to the table is the main issues and that's what we need,"" McClure said. ""And I like Biden ... he's got this calm attitude about himself. If one of them is not elected, I'd like to see them each at least serve in administration.""

Deitra Pichey, 32, came with her brother Marcus Bigger, 34, to hear Warren. While she backs Andrew Yang, she thinks Warren has a shot with black voters.

""I think her policies definitely align with the African American community, it's just that we need to hear her more,"" Pichey said. ""She needs to go to more HBCUs to speak to our community because there's a lot of issues that affect us as a whole that people running for the Democratic nomination need to hear about.""

Bigger has settled on Warren because of her plan to forgive student loan debt.

""I think she is hitting on the right points,"" he said. ""I don't know if a lot of black voters have tuned in to hear her message.""

After her event at Clinton College, Warren went to nearby soul food restaurant where she posed for pictures and signed the wall. She will return in the coming weeks for an event with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the venerable South Carolina congressman who the Democratic candidates are all courting for an endorsement.

As in 2016, there is likely to be a generational divide among black voters, with younger voters opting for the not-Biden candidates.

Sanders got 52% of black voters under 30 in 2016, yet those voters were only about 3% of voters in a CNN analysis of 27 states with exit or entrance polls. Among black voters over age 30, it was 82% Hillary Clinton to 17% Sanders. That block of older black voters were about one-fifth of Democratic voters, giving Clinton a big base of support in 2016 that has now largely shifted to Biden.

While Biden has drawn criticism for his praise of his work with segregationist senators and his rambling answer (record players?) to a question about slavery in the last debate, there remains a reservoir of good will toward him, particularly among older black voters.

Biden's retort when people question him on issues, particularly on race, is to say that people know him. And in this state, and all across the South among black voters that carries a lot weight. Southerners figure out who you are by figuring out who your people are. And Biden still has the clearest answer.

""When people see Biden, they see Obama's VP and they feel like he can relate,"" said Tracey Easter, 44. ""He is human. We saw him lose his son. He is a good and decent man."""

UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT IS PUBLIC! It is ALL rumor, gossip, hearsay. NO PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OR EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING! I recommend reading it. In the alternative, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here is a picture that fully describes the whistleblower & his report. Mo pic.twitter.com/OYHmoRpUgv — Mo Brooks (@RepMoBrooks) September 26, 2019

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. on Thursday at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Brooks elaborated on his feelings about the allegations, which he said could be tied to 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) supporters.

“Elizabeth Warren in my judgment is just about guaranteed to be the Democrat nominee for president, OK?” Brooks said. “And there’s probably a number of people who support Elizabeth Warren that in part were either behind the disclosure of this information or are currently promoting it today in order to enhance Elizabeth Warren’s stature vis-à-vis, Joe Biden.”

According to the Alabama Republican, Warren meets the requirements of the modern Democratic Party in both identity and ideology.

“Let’s look at who Joe Biden is, OK?” he continued. “He is a white male who is a liberal. In today’s Democratic Party, that doesn’t cut it. On a sexist level, the Democratic Party basically says we want women, not men. And Joe Biden is a man. So that doesn’t fit that identity politics item that the Democrat Party fosters on the American people. Additionally, Joe Biden is a mere liberal. The Democrats of today insist on pure socialist.”

“And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, the third principle argument that they use is based on race,” Brooks added. “They are opposed generally to the election or nomination of Caucasians. And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, she’s claimed that she’s a Native American.”

Those criteria, according to Brooks are who Democrat voters want representing their party on the ballot.

“Those are their three themes, and those are the three themes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used to beat a 20-year white male liberal incumbent congressman in New York.”

Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are knotted up in Nevada, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in the third and fourth states to cast ballots for the 2020 Democratic nomination .

Biden tops Warren by 21 points in South Carolina -- 37% of likely voters back the former vice president, 16% Warren and 11% Sanders. In Nevada, there is no clear leader, with Biden and Sanders tied at 22% of likely caucusgoers with 18% for Warren, all within the poll's margin of sampling error. In neither state does any other candidate reach double-digits.

Biden's strong standing in South Carolina rests on support from black voters. Overall, 45% of black likely primary voters back Biden, more than 30 points ahead of his closest competitor. Among white likely primary voters, however, Biden and Warren are deadlocked: 29% favor Biden, 28% Warren.

Nevada's three-way race rests on the demographic and political divides that are driving the contest nationwide. Liberal likely caucusgoers break heavily for Sanders, while moderate and conservative caucusgoers give Biden a wide edge. Those under age 50 break toward Sanders: 35% for him vs. 13% for Warren and 12% for Biden. Among those over 50, 32% back Biden, 23% Warren and 11% Sanders. Voters with college degrees are more in Warren's corner, while those without degrees split between Sanders and Biden with Warren lagging behind.

There is room in both states for these numbers to move. So far, 44% of likely caucusgoers in Nevada and 45% of likely voters in South Carolina say they've chosen a candidate and made up their mind. Another 38% in each state say they have a preference but could change their mind and 18% in Nevada and 17% in South Carolina don't have a preference yet.

Biden stands alone in South Carolina when likely voters are asked to rate their level of enthusiasm. Nearly half, 48%, would be enthusiastic about a Biden nomination, outpacing Warren's 35%, Sanders' and California Sen. Kamala Harris's 23% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 19%. In Nevada, more than 4 in 10 say they would be enthusiastic about each of the top three -- 47% for Sanders, 44% for Biden and 42% for Warren -- while 22% each would be enthusiastic about a Harris or Buttigieg nomination.

In both states, however, majorities would at least be satisfied with any of these five candidates. The share saying they would be dissatisfied or upset with any of these five peaks at 37% for Buttigieg in South Carolina and 28% for Harris or Buttigieg in Nevada.

On the issues and electability

About six in 10 likely Democratic voters or caucusgoers say it's more important to nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump than it is to nominate one who shares their views on the issues. And in both states, the group that is focused on beating Trump is more apt to favor Biden over Sanders. In Nevada, they are also more apt to favor Warren than are those focused on issues, her numbers are about the same across those groups in South Carolina.

Regardless of how they rate the importance of a candidate's positions on the issues, Nevada and South Carolina Democrats seem to differ over who can best handle the top issues facing the field. On health care, South Carolina's likely voters favor Biden -- 34% say he'd do the best job on it vs. 17% for Sanders and 16% for Warren -- while those in Nevada give Sanders an edge -- 32% say the Vermonter would do the best job on health care, 25% Biden, 17% Warren.

In Nevada, there's a massive divide within likely caucusgoers over health care along ideological lines, mirroring the debate the candidates have had publicly over the merits of ""Medicare for All."" Fully 50% of liberal likely caucusgoers say they trust Sanders most on health care with 20% naming Warren and 15% Biden, while Sanders trails Biden by 11 points among moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers (31% Biden, 20% Sanders and 14% Warren). The ideological gap is narrower in South Carolina.

Biden holds a wide edge overall on each of the five issues tested in South Carolina (health care, the climate crisis, gun policy, the economy and immigration. In Nevada, however, things get tighter outside of health care. On no other issue does a single candidate earn the trust of even 25% of likely caucusgoers, with Sanders, Biden and Warren clustered near the top across all five.

Rating Trump

Looking beyond the primaries, the President's approval rating in Nevada -- likely to be a critical battleground state in 2020 -- is underwater, 51% disapprove while 41% approve. That's about the same as it was last October just before Democrats won a Senate seat there, one of two picked up from Republicans in the 2018 midterms. In South Carolina, Trump's ratings outpace his national marks, which currently hover around 40% approval, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving. In both states, there is a 90-point gap between where Republicans and Democrats stand on Trump's approval, with independents tilting negative.

The surveys were conducted from September 22 through 26, during which time House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President . Looking at interviews conducted before and after the announcement of the inquiry, there does not appear to be a shift in Trump's ratings.

The Republican Party in both states has canceled its Republican nominating contest for 2020. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents largely back their party's decision, though. In South Carolina, 62% approve of canceling the primary, while 52% approve of the Nevada GOP's cancellation of its caucus. But even among those Republicans and Republican-leaners who disapprove of the decision to cancel the primary or caucus, the President is still deeply popular (83% approve of his job performance in Nevada, 74% in South Carolina).

The CNN polls in Nevada and South Carolina were conducted by telephone among random samples of adults in each state. In Nevada, results among the 1,203 adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, it is 7.1 points for results among the 324 likely Democratic caucusgoers. In South Carolina, results among 1,200 adults carry an error margin of 3.4 percentage points, while those among the 406 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of 5.9 points."

Nevada is right next door to California, her home state. South Carolina has a large black population.

Instead, she’s at 5% in Nevada and 3% in South Carolina.

When you dig a little deeper, there doesn’t seem to be any untapped well of support. Just 22% of likely caucus-goers in Nevada and 23% of likely primary voters in South Carolina say they would be enthusiastic about her winning the nomination. That’s more than 20 points behind the leader in each contest.

Harris tied with Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and only statistically insignificantly ahead of him in South Carolina when it comes to enthusiasm. Both states have been among the South Bend, Indiana, mayor’s weakest.

These numbers suggest that Harris is making the right call by planting herself in Iowa. Even if these states should be stronger for her in theory, she polls about as well in Iowa. These states are not anywhere close to a backstop for Harris. What she needs is to somehow use Iowa as a catapult to improve her standing in these later contests.

Perhaps the only encouraging sign for Harris is she’s at 6% among black voters in South Carolina compared to Elizabeth Warren’s 4%. That is, she is in no worse position than Warren among a pivotal bloc of voters, even as she struggles overall. It suggests Harris has more room to grow with black voters -- if her campaign can ever get going."

The former CIA officer said that if the “whistleblower” is being used in an effort to try and remove President Trump, the individual should be forced to testify before Congress.

“You better stand up and do it publicly,” said Wright. He also criticized House Democrats for moving forward without gathering all of the facts.

“This isn’t about trying to get facts. We’ve already decided, as a partisan Democratic Party. I’m sorry to say, we’ve already decided we have to get rid of the president. We’re moving forward with it, irrespective of facts. That is clear.”

On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed, without evidence, that Russia was involved in the phone conversation in July between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way,” Pelosi said during an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe.

She continued:

We saw what the Russian disruption of our election last time, their interference, 100% confidence of the intelligence community, high confidence in the intelligence community, that the Russians disrupted our election. That was wrong. The integrity of our elections is central to our democracy. So what the president did in inviting outside intervention into our election, it goes beyond the pale.

On Saturday, President Trump criticized Democrats on Twitter for focusing all of their efforts on impeachment:

On September 21, Breitbart News reported that Congressional Republicans defended President Trump against the Democrats and the accusations made by the “whistleblower.”

“It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

“Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out — Whoa, different story! This seems to be the same kind of deal,” he concluded.

However, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said Friday that she hopes the impeachment inquiry will be completed before 2020 primary voting begins in February.

“Do you think it’s important that all of this be wrapped up before voting begins in February?” CNN’s political correspondent, MJ Lee, asked Warren on Friday’s broadcast of OutFront.

""How is it possible that after the country was torn apart by the Russian interference in the 2016 election and its aftermath, and after (President Donald) Trump himself endured almost two years under the searing spotlight of an investigation into that very thing, how is it possible that he could reach out to another country and -- according to a whistleblower complaint -- attempt another round of election interference? How is that possible?""

Her answer: ""Trump has apparently come to believe that he is so brilliant, so talented, so invincible , that he could get away with defying every norm, every practice, every institution of the democracy he is charged with leading.""

In a word from ancient Greece: hubris.

described it another way: ""Trump's decision to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a political opponent one day after the country heard special counsel Robert Mueller testify before Congress suggests a man with a political death wish .""

One thing worked well for candidate Donald Trump in 2016. His ability to nickname and define his political rivals swiftly and mercilessly froze everyone else out of the Republican nomination and then helped secure him an Electoral College victory over Hillary Clinton. So, according to documents released this past week, he decided to do it again -- by tarring 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden as dishonest and mired in a Ukraine corruption investigation -- despite the lack of evidence that the former vice president had done anything wrong.

But is this election fundamentally different from 2016, with Trump as President seeking re-election rather than as an unlikely candidate?

Peter Bergen: "" Last week's disclosures explained why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an inquiry that could lead to Trump's impeachment, wrote: "" A sitting president appears to have abused his office for political gain, and White House officials allegedly engaged in a cover-up of that effort.""

Elie Honig noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: Why on earth was Giuliani -- a private citizen and not an employee of the US government -- involved in any of this at all? The answer, it seems, is that Trump's dealings with Ukraine were intended for his own personal and political benefit and not for (or perhaps at the expense of) the best interests of the United States.""

Josh Campbell said we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" Trump famously punches back at critics. And former FBI supervisory special agentsaid we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal , publicly blasting the whistleblower as a 'partisan,' even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is.

And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as 'the Ukraine witch hunt.'""

Now what?

As congressional committees investigate, people are looking ahead to the debate over whether Trump's actions are indeed impeachable.

Frank Bowman III is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: ""If what Trump did here isn't impeachable, nothing is.""

Forty-five years ago, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal. Nixon resigned within two weeks. Bowman wrote, ""Nixon's conduct was penny-ante compared to Trump's. Trump didn't cover up a second-rate burglary by a group of inept 'plumbers' looking for dirt on Democrats. Rather, he appears to have wielded the entire economic, military and moral authority of a great nation to, effectively, extort another democratically elected head of state.""

Paul Callan: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. Trump's tendency to ""speak in a code,"" as Trump fixer Michael Cohen explained to a Congressional committee, is worth remembering when you read the rough transcript of the President's call with Zelensky, wrote: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. The 'stick' or threat that can be wielded is a cut-off of US aid unless Trump gains a personal benefit, the destruction of a political rival.""

Absolutely not. of The Washington Post wrote that the Democrats favoring impeachment are getting ahead of the evidence relating to Trump's request for an investigation of Biden: ""Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. But the reality of this call is a far cry from overheated charges that Trump used US aid to repeatedly pressure Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. At a news conference with Trump at the United Nations, Zelensky said the call was 'normal' and 'nobody pushed me.' Career public integrity prosecutors at the Justice Department also reviewed the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call and found there was no campaign finance crime to pursue.""

Julian Zelizer. ""There is a compelling argument that Many have written about the pressure a vote for impeachment would place on moderate Democrats elected in districts where Trump won in 2016. But the real test is of Republicans, who profess faith in limited government and the rule of law, wrote. ""There is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles . In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for.""

Michael D'Antonio wrote. ""This will work for as long as they believe he is truly powerful. Now that the cracks are beginning to show, he cannot count on anyone's genuine affection or loyalty. So far, congressional Republicans have been more lukewarm than usual in their support of Trump, amid reports that a majority of GOP senators would oppose the President, if they could vote to remove him in secret (they can't). ""The President achieved his dominance over the GOP by making just about everyone in the party afraid of him,""wrote. ""This will work for as long as they believe he is truly powerful.

Cory Booker on Sunday announced he has reached the required donor threshold to qualify for the fifth Democratic presidential debate despite his campaign running behind on a self-imposed donation fundraising goal of $1.7 million.

The New Jersey senator's announcement comes after the Democratic National Committee announced last week that candidates must meet higher donor thresholds in order to qualify for the November debates. Candidates must raise money from 165,000 separate donors -- including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories, up from the current minimum of 130,000 donors.

""We have nearly 35,000 donors who have been helping us make this goal. We've raised $1.5 million plus,"" Booker told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""We've actually already crossed the threshold to make the November debates of 165,000 unique donors. The surge and the momentum is great, but yeah, I still need help.""

Booker has already qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate , which will be moderated by CNN and The New York Times, but he has not yet met the polling threshold to qualify for the November stage. The DNC has not yet announced the date for that debate.

(CNN) The whistleblower complaint is certainly worthy of investigation, but is an inappropriate phone call an impeachable offense? Is there evidence of a quid pro quo? Is there a case to be made that President Trump engaged in a ""betrayal of his oath of office""? Or is this a rush to judgment at a time we need to slow down and look at the facts?

Alice Stewart

It's not a heavy lift to find Republicans who have, at some point, looked at President Trump's actions and said, ""I would not have done that"" or ""I would not have said it that way."" I count myself among them. With that as a starting point, it's important to consider the credibility of the whistleblower complaint, the calculation of the Democrats and the collateral damage that will likely result from the impeachment proceedings.

Credibility of complaint:

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday that the whistleblower did the right thing and the complaint was ""credible"" and ""important.""

That's true, from the standpoint that the complaint follows the appropriate protocol and reporting procedures. The official complaint is a clearly calculated document, more likely prepared by an attorney than the work of a rank-and-file member of the intelligence community.

Ford’s accusatory testimony – in which she accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a college party more than 30 years ago – was fraught with contradictions. Ford claimed that her friend, Leland Keyser, was at the party where the alleged assault took place. However, Keyser has been quoted denying any recollection of the alleged event.

“I don’t have any confidence in the story. Those facts together I don’t recollect, and it just didn’t make any sense,” she said, according to the New York Times’ Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly’s book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.

“It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she’s getting home,” Keyser said. “I just really didn’t have confidence in the story.”

Even Ford’s father reportedly supported Kavanaugh’s confirmation, despite his daughter’s unfounded claims.

Despite the pending questions, Ford has remained a heroic political figure for many on the left. She made Time Magazine’s annual “100 Most Influential People” list, which featured a profile written by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who praised Ford’s “sacrifice.”

“Her story, spoken while holding back tears, shook Washington and the country. Her courage, in the face of those who wished to silence her, galvanized Americans,” Harris wrote.

“And her unfathomable sacrifice, out of a sense of civic duty, shined a spotlight on the way we treat survivors of sexual violence,” she continued.

Harris praised Ford again on Friday in an op-ed published by Elle, calling for an impeachment inquiry into Kavanaugh.

“After allegations of sexual assault surfaced during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, I saw up close that the hearings and FBI investigation were not a serious pursuit of truth or justice,” she continued.

“We need to get to the truth about Kavanaugh. And I believe the best path to truth and accountability is through a formal impeachment process,” she added."

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL) discussed the possible motivations of the renewed push against Trump as it pertained to Ukraine.

“I think they’re trying to make the president look bad,” Aderholt said. “That’s one aspect of it – but also trying to appease their Democrat base on the other side. Now what is going to be interesting, I think, is see what in the next few days and next couple of weeks what we see this does to Biden because Biden is all wrapped up in this whole thing and his son Hunter. So, I don’t know how that’s going to have an impact.”

The Alabama Republican lawmaker said given the Biden son’s involvement in the saga, Biden could be eliminated from contention for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

“I think quite honestly Biden is out of the picture,” he continued. “I’ve said for quite some time now that I don’t think he will be the nominee. And I think with this recent thing he has implicated with his son that I think this assures he will not be the nominee.”

Aderholt went on to add that among his House colleagues, there is a consensus Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will be the nominee.

“Certainly, those on the left side of the party – they don’t like Trump obviously,” he added. “But they don’t really like Biden either. So, I think Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren – that’s who they would gravitate toward. I talk to a lot of my colleagues. I casually just ask the question about how they see this playing out. It seems like the consensus is that Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee.”

The younger Biden, who has a storied history of personal and professional issues, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the Bidens are denying any wrongdoing, even going to the extent of accusing Trump of abusing his power, the situation only underscores the shadowy nature of Hunter Biden’s professional life.

Breitbart News is providing an indepth breakdown of instances in which Hunter Biden’s business interests directly intersected with his father’s position in elective office.

1. Joe Biden’s top campaign contributor hired Hunter fresh out of law school.

Shortly after Joe Biden was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, his largest campaign contributor, the credit card issuer MBNA Corp., hired Hunter for an undisclosed role. The job raised eyebrows from ethics watchdogs since MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner designed to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations.

Clouding the picture even further was the fact that then 26-year-old Hunter Biden was a recent graduate of Yale Law School with no banking or business experience. Both father and son defended the job offer, claiming nothing improper had or would result because of the arrangement.

“Unfortunately, no matter where I went to work, some people would make an issue of it,” the younger Biden told the Delaware News Journal in November 1996 when the job was announced.

Despite his role being unknown at the time of his hiring, when Hunter Biden left the company in 1998 to join the Clinton-era Commerce Department it was as a senior vice president.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Joe Biden was championing bankruptcy reform legislation endorsed by financial interests and credit card companies such as MBNA.

2. Hunter Biden was on MBNA’s payroll while Joe Biden was writing bankruptcy reform legislation.

In the early-2000s, Hunter Biden remained on MBNA’s payroll as a consultant while his father was writing and pushing the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The arrangement, which did not become public until after the law was passed, started in 2001 after Hunter Biden had left his position in the Commerce Department. Hunter Biden was paid monthly consulting fees, with some claiming they ranged upwards of $100,000, to advise the company on online banking issues.

The 2005 bankruptcy law tightened regulations to make it extremely difficult to declare bankruptcy. The law was heavily favored by MBNA and other giants in the banking and finance sectors. Many consumer protection advocates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have claimed the bill benefited special interests at the expense of consumers. Some have even suggested the law only served to hasten and aggravate the recession of the late 2000s.

As previously reported by the New York Times, Biden worked against many of his own fellow Democrats in Congress to ensure the final version of the bill was free of provisions opposed by companies such as MBNA.

Biden “was one of five Democrats in March 2005 who voted against a proposal to require credit card companies to provide more effective warnings to consumers about the consequences of paying only the minimum amount due each month,” the Times noted.

3. Hunter Biden sought to monetize off his father’s political standing on Wall Street.

In 2006, shortly before Joe Biden assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and launched his second presidential campaign, Hunter purchased a hedge fund called Paradigm Global Advisors with his uncle, James. Although neither had a strong background in finance, James and Hunter believed they could leverage Joe Biden’s political connections to their benefit.

“Don’t worry about investors,” James Biden, the former vice president’s younger brother, purportedly told Paradigm’s senior leadership upon taking over the fund, as reported by Politico. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden.”

Paradigm’s executives claim that James and Hunter Biden saw the hedge fund as a way to “take money from rich foreigners who could not legally give money” to Joe Biden’s campaign account.

“We’ve got investors lined up in a line of 747s filled with cash ready to invest in this company,” James Biden allegedly told Paradigm’s staff.

As part of their effort to cash in on Joe Biden’s political influence, Hunter and James also tried to solicit labor unions to invest their pension funds with Paradigm. The duo’s main argument when pitching to unions was their access and ties to Joe Biden, who has a long record of advocating for collective bargaining.

The entire approach proved unsuccessful after a series of bad investments — including a partnership with a Ponzi scheme. James and Hunter eventually chose to strip the hedge fund of all its assets in 2010, selling them to the highest bidder before shuttering it indefinitely.

4. Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China only days after his father paid an official visit to the country.

As Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden inked a multi-billion dollar deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The deal, which was the first of its kind, created a private equity fund, Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) to invest Chinese money overseas.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China. Schweizer said:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. So basically, no challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden is still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

5. The Obama-Biden administration helped facilitate the sale of U.S. company with insight into military technology to BHR and a Chinese state-owned defense firm.

In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government — made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company.

The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced “dual-use” anti-vibration technology with U.S. “military applications.” CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications.

When the AVIC and BHR’s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was “reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,” which it later “reportedly incorporated … into China’s J-20 and J‑31 aircraft.”

Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC purchasing 51 percent of the company and BHR taking ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the “biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

Although the deal was approved by the Obama administration, it has not escaped congressional scrutiny. In August, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) launched a probe into whether or not the CFIUS decision was influenced by either Joe Biden or former Secretary of State John Kerry, whose stepson was also involved in the venture.

“The direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,” Grassley noted when launching the probe."

At a CNN town hall in March in Jackson, Mississippi, she talked boldly about the enduring stain of chattel slavery and her plans to address lingering racial inequality.

A month later, she got a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference where she set the pace on black maternal health care policy. Jesse Jackson lavished her with praise, seeming to single her out after her speech at the Rainbow Push conference in June.

And at Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington, DC, in early September, she drew the largest applause of all the candidates, two of whom were CBC members. She has also grabbed endorsements from prominent black women, such as Roxane Gay.

Yet, Warren, whose campaign feels most like a movement, has struggled to translate that appeal to black voters on the ground. On the campus of a small historically black college here this weekend that was very much evident -- she only drew a handful of black voters in a crowd of about 1,000 people. Event attendance, particularly on a Saturday afternoon in 90 degree weather, is a very rough metric -- Biden's crowd at the same venue was mostly white as well. But it's clear that Warren, like Bernie Sanders before her, is struggling with black voters. She is all the rage on black twitter, not so much elsewhere. A new CNN poll has her lagging Biden in this state among black voters by 41 points -- she notches 4% among black voters. (Sanders gets 13%).

Asked Saturday about closing this gap and why she thinks it persists, she answered:

""The way I see this is that African American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now. They get out there and they fight for you. What I'm doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I'm in this fight. About what's broken and how to fix it and how we're building a grassroots movement to get it done. And it's not just one policy, it's everywhere. Education it is. It's about our historically black colleges and universities. It's about closing the black white wealth gap by canceling a lot of the student loan debt that's out there. It's there in health care to deal with the maternal health mortality rates that hit black women so much harder than any other group. It's about housing and attacking redlining straight on. I've got a lot of plans and what I want to do talk to people about all of them. Because ultimately we have a country that keeps working better and better for those at the top and isn't working for much of anyone else and I think we got a chance to change that.""

Her very specific plans are certainly breaking through with some voters. Casey McClure, who came with her mother and father to Warren's event here with very specific reasons why she backs the Massachusetts senator.

""I'm voting for Warren because I can't afford college anymore. I also like her plan for black women so we won't die so much in labor,"" McClure, 26, said. ""And she reminds me of Obama because she gives us hope.""

McClure said she is trying to convince her dad, Willie McClure, 65, to back Warren. He seems to lean-Biden because of the Obama connection, but is still making up his mind.

""I like Warren because of the fire she brings. What she's bringing to the table is the main issues and that's what we need,"" McClure said. ""And I like Biden ... he's got this calm attitude about himself. If one of them is not elected, I'd like to see them each at least serve in administration.""

Deitra Pichey, 32, came with her brother Marcus Bigger, 34, to hear Warren. While she backs Andrew Yang, she thinks Warren has a shot with black voters.

""I think her policies definitely align with the African American community, it's just that we need to hear her more,"" Pichey said. ""She needs to go to more HBCUs to speak to our community because there's a lot of issues that affect us as a whole that people running for the Democratic nomination need to hear about.""

Bigger has settled on Warren because of her plan to forgive student loan debt.

""I think she is hitting on the right points,"" he said. ""I don't know if a lot of black voters have tuned in to hear her message.""

After her event at Clinton College, Warren went to nearby soul food restaurant where she posed for pictures and signed the wall. She will return in the coming weeks for an event with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the venerable South Carolina congressman who the Democratic candidates are all courting for an endorsement.

As in 2016, there is likely to be a generational divide among black voters, with younger voters opting for the not-Biden candidates.

Sanders got 52% of black voters under 30 in 2016, yet those voters were only about 3% of voters in a CNN analysis of 27 states with exit or entrance polls. Among black voters over age 30, it was 82% Hillary Clinton to 17% Sanders. That block of older black voters were about one-fifth of Democratic voters, giving Clinton a big base of support in 2016 that has now largely shifted to Biden.

While Biden has drawn criticism for his praise of his work with segregationist senators and his rambling answer (record players?) to a question about slavery in the last debate, there remains a reservoir of good will toward him, particularly among older black voters.

Biden's retort when people question him on issues, particularly on race, is to say that people know him. And in this state, and all across the South among black voters that carries a lot weight. Southerners figure out who you are by figuring out who your people are. And Biden still has the clearest answer.

""When people see Biden, they see Obama's VP and they feel like he can relate,"" said Tracey Easter, 44. ""He is human. We saw him lose his son. He is a good and decent man."""

Now he's opening up about their 2020 'adventure',https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/politics/elizabeth-warren-bruce-mann-cnntv/index.html,"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) As Elizabeth Warren's candidacy for president caught fire this summer, so did images of her seemingly endless energy: running on to the stage at campaign events; punching the air when she speaks; working the photo line for hours after rallies.

In the evenings, Warren keeps moving, often doing laps around the hotel grounds or pacing in the lobby. But she does it with a different kind of intensity -- this is when she is starting to unwind, talking on the phone with her husband, Bruce Mann.

A professor at Harvard Law School specializing in legal history and property law, Mann is unquestionably the quieter half of the couple. Friends, colleagues and campaign aides say Mann has never been one to seek the public spotlight. But as Warren climbs in the polls, there may be no escaping it.

On a recent Friday morning, Mann and Bailey, the couple's rambunctious 16-month-old golden retriever, answered the side door of their Cambridge home, letting CNN reporters inside for the couple's first joint interview of the campaign. Mann's left hand was in a hard cast -- he had recently broken a bone while trying to break up a fight between Bailey and a neighbor's dog. (""Bailey got jumped, let's be clear,"" Warren would later insist -- she's never known Mann to get caught up in a scuffle. ""Bruce went to Bailey's rescue."")

Asked about the couple's contrasting personalities, Mann, 69, responded with a smile: ""It just works.""

Seated next to her husband of almost 40 years in a white wicker chair in their back sunroom, Warren chimed in in agreement. ""I don't want to be married to somebody like me. I want to be married to somebody like him.""

If Warren is elected, Mann would play an unprecedented role as the first male presidential spouse. That role once seemed likely to go to Bill Clinton , a man thoroughly accustomed to the political stage. Mann would be a very different kind of first husband -- a longtime observer of politics, but far from a politician himself. A little more than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Mann said he has not been closely involved in the ins and outs of the Warren campaign, and remains a mystery to most voters.

But those close to the couple say that Mann's influence on his wife's candidacy is not to be underestimated -- he has a unique ability to help his famously energetic wife decompress after long days of travel and campaigning, they said. ""He brings a sense of calm to her more than anyone else could,"" said Nora Keefe, Warren's bodywoman.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, husband Bruce Mann and dog Bailey.

""When you see the images of Elizabeth up in front of a crowd, waving her hands, just being part of the crowd, I can't quite imagine Bruce up there waving his hands,"" said Drew Faust, the former president of Harvard University who has been friends with the couple for years. ""There's this enormous warmth between them. And he is obviously -- they are both obviously devoted to one another and take pride in their differences.""

Warren noted that much of her life over the last year has been ""different motel rooms every night, hotel rooms every night, different food, different people around, but I always know the last person I'll have a good conversation with, the last person I'll talk to before I go to sleep, is you.""

Of those late-night phone calls, she said: ""It's like letting all the pieces go.""

That morning was looking like it could shape up to be what Warren describes as a ""really good day"": when she is home long enough to fit in two walks around Fresh Pond with Bailey and Mann, once early in the morning and again at night.

""There's really nothing better than a golden retriever puppy to create the illusion of normalcy,"" Mann joked.

""If you don't run and Democrats lose, you'll feel guilty""

In two wide-ranging interviews -- first with Mann and, later, the couple speaking together -- they discussed what has been anything but a normal year.

They couldn't pinpoint one moment when it became clear that Warren would run for president, something she had decided against doing four years ago. In the months leading up to the 2019 New Year, Warren had begun to quietly consult people whose advice she trusted, asking each of them for three reasons she shouldn't run, and three reasons she should.

""She saved me for last, and finally, she asked me for three reasons, pro and con. And I said, no, I'm not going to do it,"" Mann recalled. ""I said, you're gonna run anyways. So just doesn't matter. Because if you don't run and Democrats lose, you'll feel guilty because then that means there'd be no one to fight for the people and the issues that you care about.""

He was right. Warren would announce her exploratory campaign on New Year's Eve.

A registered Democrat and a self-described ""political junkie"" and ""compulsive reader of newspapers,"" Mann said he has been exercising discipline to avoid being consumed by news about his wife's campaign. He is sparing in what he flags to Warren, who has said she doesn't follow the news about the election closely.

US Senator from Massachusetts (D) Elizabeth Warren is flanked her husband Bruce Mann as she is sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence.

Warren has also taken a similar approach to polling, repeatedly declining to engage questions from reporters about who's up and who's down. At one point in the joint interview, when Mann was asked why he believes his wife has been leading in recent polls, Warren leaned into her husband with a reminder: ""And you remember, we don't do polls.""

""That's right, we do not do polls,"" Mann said. But he offered up a theory on what has been attracting voters to his wife this year.

""She's always had just an extraordinary ability to explain complex issues, clearly, memorably,"" he said. ""Watching people who hear her respond to her as she reaches them, as she helps them see how the issues touch their lives -- it's, I'm watching her teach on a larger stage.""

""I just fell for her from 25 yards out""

The couple's first meeting in the summer of 1979 was, as Mann describes, ""improbable."" He and Warren were both 29 and new to teaching, and had traveled to Key Biscayne, Florida, to attend an economics and law conference.

He spotted Warren, who had recently separated from her first husband, Jim Warren, across the lawn at an opening reception. ""Even from that distance, I was just drawn to her,"" he said. ""She was so just lively, so animated, so engaged. And I just fell for her from 25 yards out before even meeting her.""

Admittedly, it wasn't quite love at first sight for Warren.

""That was a Sunday, late afternoon,"" she mused of their first meeting. ""I wasn't completely in love with him until sometime mid-morning on Monday.""

What sealed the deal for Warren: ""It was on Monday when I actually saw him in shorts. And good-looking legs. That's when I was all in.""

""She completely objectified me,"" Mann responded with a grin.

If there was an immediate physical attraction, the pair also bonded over their similar upbringings.

Warren was born in Oklahoma City, the baby of four. As she has told voters on the campaign trail this year, Warren vividly remembers watching her mother walk out of the house one day to look for a job after her father suffered a heart attack. Mann's parents didn't have much money, either. ""They stretched and stretched and mortgaged to the hilt to buy the cheapest house in the town with one of the best public school systems,"" he said.

Within months of their first meeting in Florida, Warren visited Mann at the University of Connecticut, where he was teaching at the time. She sat in on one of his classes, and after all of the students had left, Mann recalled asking her: ""What'd you think?'""

""And she just said, 'What can I say? Will you marry me?' And I said, 'OK.' That is a direct quote, I remember every word.""

The couple juggled living in different cities long after they were married. Warren would continue teaching in Texas, before eventually getting hired at the University of Pennsylvania, where Mann also taught for almost 20 years. But when Warren landed a full-time teaching position at Harvard University in the 1990s, it would be years before Mann would also get a professorship at the school.

They leaned on Warren's aunt, ""Aunt Bee,"" to help raise Warren's two children from her first marriage, Amelia and Alex. In campaign speeches, Warren credits her aunt, after whom she is named, for changing the course of her life. She credits Aunt Bee, who lived with the family for 16 years, for having allowed her to continue teaching.

""Oh, she'd be so proud. She loved Elizabeth dearly,"" Mann said of Aunt Bee, who died in 1999. If she were still alive and observing Warren's 2020 campaign, Mann said, ""Her first response would probably be: 'How can I help?'""

""You just jump into the deep end and you swim""

Something else that seemed improbable to Mann in 1979 was that politics would be in the couple's future.

Warren was a Republican when they first met. She wouldn't change her party registration to Democrat until 1996. ""However conservative she might've been at the time, it was not particularly apparent and we really didn't discuss politics,"" Mann said.

But by 2011, Warren had made a name for herself in Washington, overseeing the Trouble Assets Relief Program after the financial crisis and conceiving of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama. That September, she mounted her first political campaign against Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren onstage which her husband Bruce Mann and dog Bailey.

It was during this closely watched Senate race that Warren first came under fire for her past claims to Native American heritage. She would defeat Brown, handing the Democrats a major pick-up in the Senate, but the criticism of how Warren handled her family history lingered. Her campaign's decision last year to release the results of a DNA test, which showed distant Native American ancestry, was widely panned.

For Mann, who was close to Warren's extended family in Oklahoma, these criticisms were particularly painful.

""I knew everyone in her family, loved her family, knew all the stories that they had grown up with,"" Mann said. ""Because it was an attack on her family, it was one that was sort of probably the least pleasant of the attacks she's endured.""

As for the possibility that Warren would be up against Trump if she were to win the Democratic nomination, Mann was matter of fact.

""I'm not sure if anyone -- how anyone trains for it,"" he said. ""I mean for all of this, you just jump into the deep end and you swim.""

The couple also insisted that they do not talk about what life could be like at the White House. ""It's a bit early for that,"" Mann said. In the classroom, Mann said he never mentions his wife's name or the campaign, a boundary that his students have been respectful of.

""They observe that separation. It's probably killing them, but they're very good,"" he said.

Mann has not done any interviews this year, with the exception of a brief encounter with reporters outside of their Cambridge home on New Year's Eve, hours after Warren announced her exploratory campaign. Prompted for a comment, Mann had said that day: ""We've been married a long time and it's always been an adventure. So this is just another one.""

Asked how that adventure was going, Mann told CNN: ""Extraordinarily well.""

""Certainly back then, I had no idea what it would look like -- only that we would do it,"" he said. ""Every part of it remains an adventure. So I stand by that statement."""

Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are knotted up in Nevada, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in the third and fourth states to cast ballots for the 2020 Democratic nomination .

Biden tops Warren by 21 points in South Carolina -- 37% of likely voters back the former vice president, 16% Warren and 11% Sanders. In Nevada, there is no clear leader, with Biden and Sanders tied at 22% of likely caucusgoers with 18% for Warren, all within the poll's margin of sampling error. In neither state does any other candidate reach double-digits.

Biden's strong standing in South Carolina rests on support from black voters. Overall, 45% of black likely primary voters back Biden, more than 30 points ahead of his closest competitor. Among white likely primary voters, however, Biden and Warren are deadlocked: 29% favor Biden, 28% Warren.

Nevada's three-way race rests on the demographic and political divides that are driving the contest nationwide. Liberal likely caucusgoers break heavily for Sanders, while moderate and conservative caucusgoers give Biden a wide edge. Those under age 50 break toward Sanders: 35% for him vs. 13% for Warren and 12% for Biden. Among those over 50, 32% back Biden, 23% Warren and 11% Sanders. Voters with college degrees are more in Warren's corner, while those without degrees split between Sanders and Biden with Warren lagging behind.

There is room in both states for these numbers to move. So far, 44% of likely caucusgoers in Nevada and 45% of likely voters in South Carolina say they've chosen a candidate and made up their mind. Another 38% in each state say they have a preference but could change their mind and 18% in Nevada and 17% in South Carolina don't have a preference yet.

Biden stands alone in South Carolina when likely voters are asked to rate their level of enthusiasm. Nearly half, 48%, would be enthusiastic about a Biden nomination, outpacing Warren's 35%, Sanders' and California Sen. Kamala Harris's 23% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 19%. In Nevada, more than 4 in 10 say they would be enthusiastic about each of the top three -- 47% for Sanders, 44% for Biden and 42% for Warren -- while 22% each would be enthusiastic about a Harris or Buttigieg nomination.

In both states, however, majorities would at least be satisfied with any of these five candidates. The share saying they would be dissatisfied or upset with any of these five peaks at 37% for Buttigieg in South Carolina and 28% for Harris or Buttigieg in Nevada.

On the issues and electability

About six in 10 likely Democratic voters or caucusgoers say it's more important to nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump than it is to nominate one who shares their views on the issues. And in both states, the group that is focused on beating Trump is more apt to favor Biden over Sanders. In Nevada, they are also more apt to favor Warren than are those focused on issues, her numbers are about the same across those groups in South Carolina.

Regardless of how they rate the importance of a candidate's positions on the issues, Nevada and South Carolina Democrats seem to differ over who can best handle the top issues facing the field. On health care, South Carolina's likely voters favor Biden -- 34% say he'd do the best job on it vs. 17% for Sanders and 16% for Warren -- while those in Nevada give Sanders an edge -- 32% say the Vermonter would do the best job on health care, 25% Biden, 17% Warren.

In Nevada, there's a massive divide within likely caucusgoers over health care along ideological lines, mirroring the debate the candidates have had publicly over the merits of ""Medicare for All."" Fully 50% of liberal likely caucusgoers say they trust Sanders most on health care with 20% naming Warren and 15% Biden, while Sanders trails Biden by 11 points among moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers (31% Biden, 20% Sanders and 14% Warren). The ideological gap is narrower in South Carolina.

Biden holds a wide edge overall on each of the five issues tested in South Carolina (health care, the climate crisis, gun policy, the economy and immigration. In Nevada, however, things get tighter outside of health care. On no other issue does a single candidate earn the trust of even 25% of likely caucusgoers, with Sanders, Biden and Warren clustered near the top across all five.

Rating Trump

Looking beyond the primaries, the President's approval rating in Nevada -- likely to be a critical battleground state in 2020 -- is underwater, 51% disapprove while 41% approve. That's about the same as it was last October just before Democrats won a Senate seat there, one of two picked up from Republicans in the 2018 midterms. In South Carolina, Trump's ratings outpace his national marks, which currently hover around 40% approval, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving. In both states, there is a 90-point gap between where Republicans and Democrats stand on Trump's approval, with independents tilting negative.

The surveys were conducted from September 22 through 26, during which time House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President . Looking at interviews conducted before and after the announcement of the inquiry, there does not appear to be a shift in Trump's ratings.

The Republican Party in both states has canceled its Republican nominating contest for 2020. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents largely back their party's decision, though. In South Carolina, 62% approve of canceling the primary, while 52% approve of the Nevada GOP's cancellation of its caucus. But even among those Republicans and Republican-leaners who disapprove of the decision to cancel the primary or caucus, the President is still deeply popular (83% approve of his job performance in Nevada, 74% in South Carolina).

The CNN polls in Nevada and South Carolina were conducted by telephone among random samples of adults in each state. In Nevada, results among the 1,203 adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, it is 7.1 points for results among the 324 likely Democratic caucusgoers. In South Carolina, results among 1,200 adults carry an error margin of 3.4 percentage points, while those among the 406 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of 5.9 points."

Nevada is right next door to California, her home state. South Carolina has a large black population.

Instead, she’s at 5% in Nevada and 3% in South Carolina.

When you dig a little deeper, there doesn’t seem to be any untapped well of support. Just 22% of likely caucus-goers in Nevada and 23% of likely primary voters in South Carolina say they would be enthusiastic about her winning the nomination. That’s more than 20 points behind the leader in each contest.

Harris tied with Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and only statistically insignificantly ahead of him in South Carolina when it comes to enthusiasm. Both states have been among the South Bend, Indiana, mayor’s weakest.

These numbers suggest that Harris is making the right call by planting herself in Iowa. Even if these states should be stronger for her in theory, she polls about as well in Iowa. These states are not anywhere close to a backstop for Harris. What she needs is to somehow use Iowa as a catapult to improve her standing in these later contests.

Perhaps the only encouraging sign for Harris is she’s at 6% among black voters in South Carolina compared to Elizabeth Warren’s 4%. That is, she is in no worse position than Warren among a pivotal bloc of voters, even as she struggles overall. It suggests Harris has more room to grow with black voters -- if her campaign can ever get going."

How is that possible?""

In a word from ancient Greece: hubris.

One thing worked well for candidate Donald Trump in 2016. His ability to nickname and define his political rivals swiftly and mercilessly froze everyone else out of the Republican nomination and then helped secure him an Electoral College victory over Hillary Clinton. So, according to documents released this past week, he decided to do it again -- by tarring 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden as dishonest and mired in a Ukraine corruption investigation -- despite the lack of evidence that the former vice president had done anything wrong.

But is this election fundamentally different from 2016, with Trump as President seeking re-election rather than as an unlikely candidate?

Peter Bergen: "" Last week's disclosures explained why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an inquiry that could lead to Trump's impeachment, wrote: "" A sitting president appears to have abused his office for political gain, and White House officials allegedly engaged in a cover-up of that effort.""

Elie Honig noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: Why on earth was Giuliani -- a private citizen and not an employee of the US government -- involved in any of this at all? The answer, it seems, is that Trump's dealings with Ukraine were intended for his own personal and political benefit and not for (or perhaps at the expense of) the best interests of the United States.""

Josh Campbell said we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" Trump famously punches back at critics. And former FBI supervisory special agentsaid we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal , publicly blasting the whistleblower as a 'partisan,' even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is. The President denied knowing which phone call media reports were even referring to, and then minutes later described the same call as having been 'beautiful.' And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as 'the Ukraine witch hunt.'""

Now what?

As congressional committees investigate, people are looking ahead to the debate over whether Trump's actions are indeed impeachable.

Frank Bowman III is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: ""If what Trump did here isn't impeachable, nothing is.""

Forty-five years ago, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal. Nixon resigned within two weeks. Bowman wrote, ""Nixon's conduct was penny-ante compared to Trump's. Trump didn't cover up a second-rate burglary by a group of inept 'plumbers' looking for dirt on Democrats. Rather, he appears to have wielded the entire economic, military and moral authority of a great nation to, effectively, extort another democratically elected head of state.""

Paul Callan: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. Trump's tendency to ""speak in a code,"" as Trump fixer Michael Cohen explained to a Congressional committee, is worth remembering when you read the rough transcript of the President's call with Zelensky, wrote: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. The 'stick' or threat that can be wielded is a cut-off of US aid unless Trump gains a personal benefit, the destruction of a political rival.""

Absolutely not. of The Washington Post wrote that the Democrats favoring impeachment are getting ahead of the evidence relating to Trump's request for an investigation of Biden: ""Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. But the reality of this call is a far cry from overheated charges that Trump used US aid to repeatedly pressure Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. At a news conference with Trump at the United Nations, Zelensky said the call was 'normal' and 'nobody pushed me.' Career public integrity prosecutors at the Justice Department also reviewed the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call and found there was no campaign finance crime to pursue.""

Julian Zelizer. ""There is a compelling argument that Many have written about the pressure a vote for impeachment would place on moderate Democrats elected in districts where Trump won in 2016. But the real test is of Republicans, who profess faith in limited government and the rule of law, wrote. ""There is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles . In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for.""

Michael D'Antonio wrote. ""This will work for as long as they believe he is truly powerful. Now that the cracks are beginning to show, he cannot count on anyone's genuine affection or loyalty. So far, congressional Republicans have been more lukewarm than usual in their support of Trump, amid reports that a majority of GOP senators would oppose the President, if they could vote to remove him in secret (they can't). ""The President achieved his dominance over the GOP by making just about everyone in the party afraid of him,""wrote. ""This will work for as long as they believe he is truly powerful.

(CNN) The whistleblower complaint is certainly worthy of investigation, but is an inappropriate phone call an impeachable offense? Is there evidence of a quid pro quo? Is there a case to be made that President Trump engaged in a ""betrayal of his oath of office""? Or is this a rush to judgment at a time we need to slow down and look at the facts?

It's not a heavy lift to find Republicans who have, at some point, looked at President Trump's actions and said, ""I would not have done that"" or ""I would not have said it that way."" I count myself among them. With that as a starting point, it's important to consider the credibility of the whistleblower complaint, the calculation of the Democrats and the collateral damage that will likely result from the impeachment proceedings.

Credibility of complaint:

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday that the whistleblower did the right thing and the complaint was ""credible"" and ""important.""

That's true, from the standpoint that the complaint follows the appropriate protocol and reporting procedures. The official complaint is a clearly calculated document, more likely prepared by an attorney than the work of a rank-and-file member of the intelligence community.

Andreii Telizhenko, who worked in the Ukrainian embassy in Washington between December 2015 and May 2016, says Rudy Giuliani approached him for a face-to-face meeting in May of this year.

And Sergeii Leschenko, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, says Giuliani began applying pressure on Zelensky's team to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter shortly after the former comedian was elected in April 2019.

Each has a different perspective on the crisis -- Telizhenko believes that the issues surrounding Biden merit further investigation -- but both agree that Giuliani was open in his motivations.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Joe or Hunter Biden.

Telizhenko is known for his repeated claims in the media that Democrats colluded with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald Trump and his team in an effort to boost Hilary Clinton's chances in the 2016 elections. These claims have been repeatedly debunked.

According to Telizhenko, he and Giuliani spent about six hours in New York in late May of this year and discussed a range of issues including the business dealings of Hunter Biden in Ukraine.

Asked what was discussed, he replied: ""My insights on what's happening with the US-Ukrainian relationship and the DNC Ukraine collusion was also mentioned. Mr. Giuliani also asked me about Vice President Biden, what my thoughts was, what were my insights on him.""

When asked if this line of inquiry was a priority for Giuliani, Telizhenko responded, ""Yes, he doesn't hide it, it's his work, that's what he was hired to do -- to represent the President of the United States and his personal interests.""

Telizhenko, who is 29 and a frequent visitor to Washington, says he has met with Giuliani about two or three times since their initial meeting, and insists that the debunked conspiracy theories against the Democratic Party should be investigated by both the US and Ukraine.

""No, there is no conspiracy theories. We need to investigate this properly to show to the public there is no conspiracy theories, or maybe there are, but that's what we have to find out.""

Leschenko is clear about Giuliani's motives. ""For Giuliani it was the only interest in Ukraine,"" Leschenko told CNN. ""To get this information about Biden and to use this information in the US. He was not interested in Ukraine at all -- what is going on here, [the] reform process, or anti-corruption effort, nothing. He was just focused on this topic.""

When asked if he believed Giuliani was acting on behalf of Trump, Leschenko says there was little room for doubt. ""For sure (it was) not for his private purposes. He is not, let's say, a private person to be interested in this whole mess, but just because he had relations with [the] American President.""

He recounted a conversation with a close associate of President Zelensky: ""I met with some official from this administration before this inauguration and he said we know who Giuliani is, we know what is his role, we know that he is acting not just a private person but on behalf of his client (Trump).""

He added, ""It was a clear fact that Giuliani acted on behalf of Trump and they are interested in Biden.""

Giuliani's probes did not go unnoticed by an incoming Ukrainian administration desperate for US support and military aid to battle Russian-backed separatist rebels fighting for control of the country's eastern regions. ""No one wanted to start the presidency with a conflict with American counterparts,"" Leschenko said.

CNN has asked Giuliani for comment. He has previously denied any wrongdoing and defended his efforts to get a Ukrainian investigation launched.

The poll shows both Biden and Warren tied for first place, earning 25 percent support each among Democrat primary voters. Sanders – who has been struggling to overtake his ideological ally, Warren, came in third place with 16 percent support. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth with seven percent, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) dropped to fifth place with six percent support. Ten percent of respondents said they are “not sure,” and the remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less.

The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percent when adjusted for weighting and +/- 2.9 percent for registered voters.

The September 2019 Emerson poll – taken September 21-23 – told a similar story, with Biden, Warren, and Sanders dominating the top tier with a three-point spread.

The poll shows Biden with 25 percent support and Warren and Sanders closely behind with 23 percent and 22 percent support, respectively. While Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) have dominated the top of the second tier, Andrew Yang came in fourth place, earning eight percent support, followed by Buttigieg with six percent and Harris with four percent. The remaining candidates did not crack two percent support. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, indicating a dead heat for first place among Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

The Economist/YouGov poll shows Sanders continuing to hold the edge with voters under 50 and Biden continuing to appeal to older voters:

Sanders continues to hold an advantage with voters under 50, with 28% support from that group of voters. Conversely, Biden continues to dominate the older vote with 42% support from those aged 50 or over. Warren competes with her rivals with both age groups, as she receives 23% support from those under 50 and 23% support among those 50 and over. Among voters who supported Sanders in 2016, 37% still support him, 23% now support Warren, 10% now support Biden and 9% now support Yang.

Biden appears to be losing footing in Nevada, a CNN poll found.

SSRS conducted the poll, surveying 324 likely Democrat caucus-goers September 22-26, 2019. The poll shows Sanders and Biden tied for first place with 22 percent support each. Warren fell just four points behind with 18 percent support. With a margin of error of +/- 7.1 percent, the race is locked in a dead heat.

The remaining candidates fell well outside the margin of error. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who came in fourth place, only saw five percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Tom Steyer (D) with four percent support each. Andrew Yang garnered three percent support, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) saw two percent support, and the remaining candidates garnered one percent support or less:

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a top candidate for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination, says amnesty for every illegal alien living in the United States is “good for” American workers who will be forced to compete against newly legalized low-skilled foreign workers.

During a town hall with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union in Madison Heights, Michigan, Warren said she will give amnesty to all 12 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the country, a move that would immediately drive up foreign competition in the labor market for America’s working and blue-collar class.

Warren said:

We need a pathway to citizenship for the people who are here and here to stay. They are our neighbors; they are our brothers and sisters. They are here. We need a path — not just for DREAMers — but also a path for grandmas, and for little kids, and for people who came here to work on farms, and for students who overstayed their visas. We need a path that is fair and achievable. Bring people out of the shadows. It is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions. [Emphasis added]

Similarly, Warren is promising to expand legal immigration levels, which are already at historically record-high rates. About 1.2 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants are admitted every year, not including the hundreds of thousands who arrive on temporary visas to compete against Americans for jobs.

“We need to expand legal immigration,” Warren said. “The Trump administration has cut it. Families are separated now for years through the legal system. People are frustrated with what they can’t do.”

Though Warren has taken a populist-nationalist stance on various economic policies, her plan to support more immigration to the U.S. is a key component of the globalist ideology supported by the nation’s donor class.

High levels of immigration, illegal and legal, put downward pressure on U.S. wages while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth away from America’s working and middle class and towards employers and new arrivals, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has found.

Research by analyst Steven Camarotta has found that every one percent increase in the immigrant portion of American workers’ occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.

While Warren seeks to increase foreign competition against American workers in the labor market, President Donald Trump has pursued policy initiatives to decrease competition, increasing U.S. wages and giving American workers leverage over businesses.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) winning the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, saying it would be a good thing for President Donald Trump.

Sanders said Warren “has moved so far to the left” that Americans will not be able to support her.

“The only person who is been on a steady incline and continuing to gain momentum and gain support seems to be Elizabeth Warren,” Sanders told host John Catsimatidis. “There couldn’t be better news for President Trump. I think that she has moved so far to the left in the way that she wants to fix the country I think that it will certainly help reelect the president. You know, it’s interesting — if you look at some of the things that she’s talking about and some of the things the president is talking about of what the problems in the country are — they’ve actually identified a lot of the same problems. But if you listen to how they want to solve them, you couldn’t find a more stark contrast than between the two of them.”

She continued, “I think that the far-left radical ideas that she’s bringing to the table are just not going to sell in most of America. And I think that is a great thing for the president, and frankly, it’s a good thing for the country because it helps make sure that we get four more years under this president.”

Sanders went on to say she thinks a Warren presidency would be a “scary thing for America” because of how far to the left she is.

“[Democratic presidential candidates] are so beholden to this far left-wing part of the party – the AOCs and The Squad – that they’re trying to appease them,” she explained. “And I think it’s going to be impossible to come back to the middle and try to regain some of those independent voters. And some of the people like Elizabeth Warren, I don’t think she wants to come back to the middle. I think she believes that the far left side is right. I think that’s a scary thing for America if she became president.”

Breaking: @AOC Was spotted with Bernie Sanders in Burlington Vermont earlier today. Could an endorsement be coming?? pic.twitter.com/dRTjqcq3vS — CNM (@CNMneews) September 29, 2019

The nature of their discussion remains a mystery, but it has reignited rumors of a potential endorsement on the horizon, as the Burlington Free Press noted:

INTERESTING meeting today in Burlington, VT:@BernieSanders sat down with @AOC.

The two were spotted at a diner in town and AOC’s team confirms they met. No word on what they discussed…. — Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) September 29, 2019

The meeting follows weeks of internal frenzy for the Sanders campaign, which recently shook up its staffers in New Hampshire following concerns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) surge in the early primary state — one Sanders won handily against former opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Shortly after, the Sanders campaign shook things up in Iowa, removing Jess Mazour as the campaign’s Iowa political director. “We’ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,” Shakir told the Washington Post of the move.

Both moves followed Sanders’ loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement to Warren.

“Senator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,” WFP National Party Director Maurice Mitchell said in a statement following the endorsement, according to Politico.

Democrat operatives — as well as former and current Sanders supporters — are worried about Sanders’ style and general ability to adapt, and those concerns are driving some to Warren instead.

As Politico reported:

As Sanders has stagnated and Warren has soared, even some of the Vermont senator’s supporters are expressing alarm. Something is off, they say privately, adding to the chorus of people in establishment political circles saying the same thing. Maybe he should explain how he’s different from Warren — he has deliberately avoided any hint of criticism of her — or commit to out-organizing her in the early nominating states. Or perhaps he needs to make nice with the media and hire more seasoned pros. Or what about going all-in on Iowa? The ideas from his volunteers, former aides, past delegates, steering committee members, and even some people within his campaign, vary. But they almost all come back to the same fundamental question, a question that has confounded the campaign since its earliest days: Can Bernie Sanders — a 78-year-old iconoclast whose entire identity is about standing firm in his beliefs, damn it — change?

Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow socialist, has yet to endorse a presidential candidate, but it is possible that the Sanders campaign is seeking one in hopes of a boost, particularly among idealistic and ultra-leftist millennial supporters.

Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are on the same page on a variety of hot-button Democrat issues — particularly the Green New Deal. Sanders rolled out the most aggressive climate change agenda of any of his competitors last month, clocking in around $16 trillion. The two socialist lawmakers are also strong advocates for Medicare for All.

While the New York lawmaker has praised Sanders in the past for wielding “enormous political courage” on behalf of others, she has stopped short of endorsing him:

One thing that is completely undeniable about Bernie Sanders is the enormous political courage he consistently wields on behalf of others. This statement is a big deal. He’s not just standing up for two members – he’s standing for the integrity of the entire US Congress. https://t.co/dZ8jPIyrLU — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 16, 2019

She told CNN in May that she was looking for a candidate who has a “coherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward.”

“I think Sen. Sanders has that. I also think Sen. Warren has that,” she added:"

Mark Zaid, who serves as the “whistleblower’s” lawyer, confirmed the fundraising effort in a Wednesday night tweet.

“We would appreciate any and all support US citizens can give,” Zaid tweeted.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed Wednesday that the identity of the unknown “whistleblower” has a political bias in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 rivals.

The “whistleblower”— who is reported to be a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer— said in the complaint the knowledge was obtained from “White House officials” but was not firsthand knowledge, according to a Justice Department official.

Members of Congress had opinions largely along partisan lines about whether the “whistleblower” was really a true “whistleblower.”

Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) said in a Thursday interview with Breitbart News Daily’s Alex Marlow that the purported government bureaucrat not only does not meet the standard as a “whistleblower,” but is also someone with a political bias.

2020 Democrat candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a Friday CNN interview she feared for the “whistleblower’s” safety, framing the person as someone “trying to get to the truth.”"

The younger Biden, who has a storied history of personal and professional issues, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the Bidens are denying any wrongdoing, even going to the extent of accusing Trump of abusing his power, the situation only underscores the shadowy nature of Hunter Biden’s professional life.

Breitbart News is providing an indepth breakdown of instances in which Hunter Biden’s business interests directly intersected with his father’s position in elective office.

1. Joe Biden’s top campaign contributor hired Hunter fresh out of law school.

Shortly after Joe Biden was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, his largest campaign contributor, the credit card issuer MBNA Corp., hired Hunter for an undisclosed role. The job raised eyebrows from ethics watchdogs since MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner designed to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations.

Clouding the picture even further was the fact that then 26-year-old Hunter Biden was a recent graduate of Yale Law School with no banking or business experience. Both father and son defended the job offer, claiming nothing improper had or would result because of the arrangement.

“Unfortunately, no matter where I went to work, some people would make an issue of it,” the younger Biden told the Delaware News Journal in November 1996 when the job was announced.

Despite his role being unknown at the time of his hiring, when Hunter Biden left the company in 1998 to join the Clinton-era Commerce Department it was as a senior vice president.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Joe Biden was championing bankruptcy reform legislation endorsed by financial interests and credit card companies such as MBNA.

2. Hunter Biden was on MBNA’s payroll while Joe Biden was writing bankruptcy reform legislation.

In the early-2000s, Hunter Biden remained on MBNA’s payroll as a consultant while his father was writing and pushing the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The arrangement, which did not become public until after the law was passed, started in 2001 after Hunter Biden had left his position in the Commerce Department. Hunter Biden was paid monthly consulting fees, with some claiming they ranged upwards of $100,000, to advise the company on online banking issues.

The 2005 bankruptcy law tightened regulations to make it extremely difficult to declare bankruptcy. The law was heavily favored by MBNA and other giants in the banking and finance sectors. Many consumer protection advocates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have claimed the bill benefited special interests at the expense of consumers. Some have even suggested the law only served to hasten and aggravate the recession of the late 2000s.

As previously reported by the New York Times, Biden worked against many of his own fellow Democrats in Congress to ensure the final version of the bill was free of provisions opposed by companies such as MBNA.

Biden “was one of five Democrats in March 2005 who voted against a proposal to require credit card companies to provide more effective warnings to consumers about the consequences of paying only the minimum amount due each month,” the Times noted.

3. Hunter Biden sought to monetize off his father’s political standing on Wall Street.

In 2006, shortly before Joe Biden assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and launched his second presidential campaign, Hunter purchased a hedge fund called Paradigm Global Advisors with his uncle, James. Although neither had a strong background in finance, James and Hunter believed they could leverage Joe Biden’s political connections to their benefit.

“Don’t worry about investors,” James Biden, the former vice president’s younger brother, purportedly told Paradigm’s senior leadership upon taking over the fund, as reported by Politico. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden.”

Paradigm’s executives claim that James and Hunter Biden saw the hedge fund as a way to “take money from rich foreigners who could not legally give money” to Joe Biden’s campaign account.

“We’ve got investors lined up in a line of 747s filled with cash ready to invest in this company,” James Biden allegedly told Paradigm’s staff.

As part of their effort to cash in on Joe Biden’s political influence, Hunter and James also tried to solicit labor unions to invest their pension funds with Paradigm. The duo’s main argument when pitching to unions was their access and ties to Joe Biden, who has a long record of advocating for collective bargaining.

The entire approach proved unsuccessful after a series of bad investments — including a partnership with a Ponzi scheme. James and Hunter eventually chose to strip the hedge fund of all its assets in 2010, selling them to the highest bidder before shuttering it indefinitely.

4. Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China only days after his father paid an official visit to the country.

As Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden inked a multi-billion dollar deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The deal, which was the first of its kind, created a private equity fund, Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) to invest Chinese money overseas.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China. Schweizer said:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. So basically, no challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden is still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

5. The Obama-Biden administration helped facilitate the sale of U.S. company with insight into military technology to BHR and a Chinese state-owned defense firm.

In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government — made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company.

The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced “dual-use” anti-vibration technology with U.S. “military applications.” CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications.

When the AVIC and BHR’s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was “reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,” which it later “reportedly incorporated … into China’s J-20 and J‑31 aircraft.”

Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC purchasing 51 percent of the company and BHR taking ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the “biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

Although the deal was approved by the Obama administration, it has not escaped congressional scrutiny. In August, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) launched a probe into whether or not the CFIUS decision was influenced by either Joe Biden or former Secretary of State John Kerry, whose stepson was also involved in the venture.

“The direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,” Grassley noted when launching the probe."

That's what BJ, who was living in Connecticut in 1971 and working as a bank teller, remembers about her first pregnancy. After she started to show, she had to work at a back desk away from the customers, she writes. Now living in North Carolina, BJ is one of the hundreds of women and men who wrote to us after CNN Opinion invited readers to share their experiences with pregnancy discrimination. When thinking about her own life and those of her three daughters and their pregnancies, she said, ""We have come a long way.""

When it emerged that Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren may have faced job discrimination over a pregnancy, the backlash against the claim was swift. One reason Warren's story of pregnancy discrimination prompted such an outcry from Americans on social media earlier this month and from so many of you in response to our call for stories is that for many American women -- and men -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act feels too much like a historical footnote and little else. The Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to ""prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbrth, or related medical conditions."" Before it was signed into law in 1978, it was perfectly legal to refuse to hire, or to fire, a woman because of pregnancy.

Women who, like BJ, were working parents in the 1960s and 1970s, described what it was like seeking work as a woman of childbearing years before 1978; they recalled having to show prospective employers their birth control pills or disclose the dates of their last period to prove they weren't pregnant or wouldn't try to get pregnant if hired. Other women shared heartbreaking stories with us, ones not consigned to the pre-1978 past. Companies denying benefits after a stillbirth, demanding employees return to work one week after delivery.

For those women, it might come as no surprise to consider that as recently as this year, federal courts have been called upon to adjudicate pregnancy discrimination cases; in 2015, UPS lost a pregnancy discrimination case before the Supreme Court (in a decision that united Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Samuel Alito, two justices with very different judicial worldviews).

As recently as 2007, Melanie K. -- who worked for a staffing company and was a 39-year-old mother herself -- reported a client telling her, ""Don't bring me any women who are going to have kids."" When she asked in disbelief for clarification, her client -- a national company seeking IT professionals-- reiterated: ""Avoid any woman of child-bearing age.""

Several years after Melanie's experience, Becca K., of Cleveland, recalled her boss's words to her when she returned from maternity leave after her second child. She needed to ""dial it back to basics while getting back into the swing of things"" because ""changing diapers for three months isn't the same thing as managing a multimillion-dollar business."" For Laura Astorino of Massachusetts, the comments came from a founding partner at the firm where she worked (and where she was told she couldn't have a raise since she was going on maternity leave): he called employees with children ""breeders.""

For women today, pregnancy discrimination is ""is real, it is harrowing, and it is wrong,"" wrote our op-ed contributor Kara Alaimo

These stories of pregnancy discrimination weren't just about pregnancy -- they were also about miscarriage. They were also about adoption. They were also about supporting a pregnant partner.

I was told by my CEO that I couldn't use any of my sick leave because I wasn't theoretically 'sick'. (I was pregnant with twins and would likely have a Cesarean.) I asked the CEO if a man who has back surgery is considered 'sick'. He backed down. — Linda Avey (@lindaavey) October 9, 2019

Jeff from Provo, Utah -- now a stay-at-home dad and a writer -- was a college student when his wife lost the baby she was carrying. He described being told by one of his professors that he could only take time away from class if he provided his wife's medical documentation.

Angela from Oklahoma, wrote: ""I adopted my daughter at birth and I was basically told I wasn't going to get FMLA [12 unpaid weeks for employees who qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993] for a decision I was making. However, the company policy would have allowed me to take time off if I had a drug problem, etc. Just not to take care of my child, because I CHOSE to have her, because I didn't give birth to her. I also CHOSE to leave that company.""

CNN Opinion reached out to you because Elizabeth Warren put pregnancy discrimination in the public eye and we wanted to know how you felt about it. Your willingness to share your most intimate, painful experiences humbled and honored us. Your responses showed us that for so many Americans -- past and present -- who are working to bring families into the world and support them, there are no easy answers.

""She's taken full advantage""

In 1996, I was a 4th year attorney starting a new job with a well-respected boutique firm in Houston. On my first day, one of the named partners took me to lunch. As we were entering the elevator, a visibily pregnant woman was exiting and the partner introduced her to me as one of their associates. Once on the elevator, he snidely said to me, ""This is Catherine's third child. She's taken full advantage of our maternity leave program."" I've never forgotten that comment or his tone and it definitely was in mind when I had my first, and only, child a few years later while still at the firm. I felt pressured to do a fair amount of work remotely during my 3 months of leave, so as to not damage my chance at partnership, which I eventually got. Catherine never made partner and eventually left, as I did in 2007.

I'm due in January. Things need to change

In 2011, I discovered I was pregnant after starting a new job. I work in a male-dominated field, and my pregnancy seemed to confuse my male bosses. My employer's response was, ""I've been in this industry for 10 years and I've never heard of such a thing!"" I assure you, my reproductive system works the same way as any other woman's. They didn't want to work with me on appointments. They didn't understand why I needed to miss hours for glucose tolerance testing, an amniocentesis, my anatomy scan. They were upset I could no longer lift 50 pounds or more.

I live in a state that isn't really pro-women's rights. I'd been on the job for 6 months when I was placed on modified bed rest for the last 4 weeks of my pregnancy. My company kept my job open. However, when I finally delivered, I was expected to return to work just two weeks later. I had a difficult delivery, and my doctor wouldn't authorize a return to work until 8 weeks postpartum. I didn't qualify for FMLA.

I lost that position. I was a single parent. The loss of income was devastating. I had to put my children on Medicaid to insure them. We went on SNAP for a while. In the end, I spent 18 months as a stay-at-home parent, and I cherish that time. But I'd rather have been employed.

Now, in 2019, seven years later, I find myself in the exact same position. I started a new job and discovered I was pregnant. Nothing has changed. If anything, the current environment is even more hostile to mothers in the workplace. I work for a really good company, so that helps, but I still find myself with no job protection. I still don't qualify for FMLA. My state still has no provision for pregnant women. Health care costs have skyrocketed, and as have the costs of having a baby.

I'm due in January. Things need to change. This country is lacking in women's rights. Many mothers would love to stay home with their new baby for a year [as other countries mandate in terms of paid leave]. We simply can't afford to. At the very least, we need a maternity program that isn't dependent on how long you've been working. Let us collect Social Security during that time. If our employers can't afford to hold our jobs, which is especially hard for smaller companies, let us collect unemployment. Humanity literally depends on women having babies. It's time for this country to realize that.

Men are also punished

When my wife was pregnant with our third child, we had some significant health scares for the baby requiring weekly ultrasounds. I didn't miss more work than I had sick time, but I used my accrued sick leave to help take care of my wife and children when needed. When the opportunity for promotion came up, my supervisor told me that they needed someone more dependable and that because I had taken so much time off to care for my family, I wouldn't be eligible. (I also never took time off for this without finding someone to cover as well.) I am sure that it is worse for the women who are pregnant, but men who actually take time off for pregnancy/paternity leave are also punished.

Discrimination isn't the problem. Entitlement is

Having a child as a working parent is difficult. I know because I have two children. Both were delivered via Caesarian and I was fortunate to have eight weeks with each baby after delivery. Before deciding to have children, consideration was given to the time and effort required to raise a child. It became glaringly apparent that parenting would not come without sacrifice. Never did my employer indicate that pregnancy, nursing or parenting would impact my job. Had they suggested that, I would not have blamed them. I spent 9 months mostly in the office bathroom vomiting (pre-delivery) and a significant amount of time pumping when I returned from maternity leave. Guess what, my male cohorts didn't.

I am not denying that there are ignorant people out there, but I think the prevalent problem facing us is that of entitlement. We want to be successful career women, but don't want to sacrifice having children. We want to have children, but expect to be given advantages, excuses, for sub-par performance. The reality is that life is about choices. I have made mine after careful consideration. Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. This is my experience. Please consider it as valid before dismissing it because it doesn't align with your storyline.

Pregnant? You still have to lift a Labrador retriever

I worked as a veterinary technician and was told that while they understood I could no longer assist with X-rays, I was expected to continue lifting dogs up to 75 lbs by myself and that I would not be allowed extra breaks or time off during my pregnancy. I considered quitting, but felt certain that another veterinary establishment would choose not to hire me if they knew I was pregnant.

What it was like the year the Pregnancy Discrimination Act became law

In 1978, I was a 21-year-old female interviewing for my first management position after college. I remember, distinctly, making it to the final round of interviews with four different corporations in which the hiring manager doing the final interview was always a white male. In three of the four interviews, I was asked when I was planning to get married and have children. My response was I wasn't in a relationship and couldn't see that happening for many years to come. After convincing them my career was my priority, each of these men followed up with a sentiment similar to, ""Of course you understand why we have to ask that question. Training new management recruits and investing in their careers is expensive. If you were to go off and start having babies, you wouldn't be able to give us the same level of commitment."" I was offered a position with all four corporations; I accepted a position with the corporation that never approached that question.

You're forced to choose and live with the consequences

I was a married PhD student. When my dissertation director found out I was expecting my first child, he was furious. ""You can't have a baby AND write a dissertation. It can't be done,"" he said. I did both, but had even more resistance about being a new mom when I defended my dissertation -- this time by the women on my committee. Even though they teach, higher ed is NOT mom-friendly. And this was in 2006!

I had another discriminatory incident when I gave birth to my second child. I was adjunct teaching at the university level and had my course load cut in half when my second child was born. I was told the cut would only last a semester, to accommodate my schedule, but the program director never reassigned the courses next semester. So my salary was permanently cut in half. I knew something like that would happen, and came back to work 3 weeks after giving birth to try to protect my job. Obviously, that didn't work.

This is the reality for women in America's higher education system. You're forced to choose, and live with the consequences. I just don't understand why Warren's comment is even a question. It happens every day.

With a baby in the NICU, I lost my job

I went into the hospital with pregnancy complications at 29 weeks and was [put on] 24-hour bed rest. I delivered my daughter 6 weeks early at 34 weeks. I notified my employer of her birth per being told to a few days later. I was then informed that I only had 2 weeks of leave left and would need to return to work after or be terminated. They ran my short-term disability and FMLA concurrently without telling me so I used up 6 out of the 8 weeks while on bed rest. I asked if I could work from home because I physically couldn't come back in two weeks (C-section delivery). It was up to my supervisor to approve and he denied stating he didn't believe I would truly work. With a new baby in the NICU and fresh from surgery, I was terminated from my job.

I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy

I am Elizabeth Warren's vintage. Interviewing for my first professional job In 1978, I was pregnant but did not disclose it. Part of the hiring process was passing a physical. I actually prayed it would not disclose the pregnancy, knowing I would not get hired. After many months of working to make myself indispensable (and still hiding my pregnancy), I told my manager I would need a maternity leave. Annoyed, he said if he'd known I was pregnant he would not have hired me. Nevertheless, he did not fire me and I returned to work after a six-week leave. Four years later, I again became pregnant. My manager was then a VP and I was then a director. By that time, it was assumed I would take a leave and return to work, which I did. But I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy.

""You better not be pregnant""

I was working at a law firm in 2014 and was called into my boss' office and he inappropriately told me that another attorney had just told him she was pregnant, so his direct quote to me was, ""She is pregnant so you better not be."" He then went on to tell me that only one of us could be pregnant on the team at once and that we all better coordinate that. The truth was I had just found out the day before that I was pregnant and was then completely terrified. I unfortunately suffered a miscarriage with that pregnancy, but knew that I would never be able to have a healthy pregnancy at that office. I had seen them fire a pregnant woman and also fire a woman who came back to work post pregnancy who was then hospitalized for severe postpartum depression. She was fired while still out on leave for her postpartum. I had also been told that my career would be ruined if I got pregnant. Rather than continue my career as a law firm attorney and continue in that environment, I chose to take a corporate job where I remain today, happily the mom of 2.

I've been one of the ""lucky"" ones

I went for an interview at 10 weeks pregnant. I had 2 previous consistent miscarriages, so I didn't feel comfortable disclosing I was pregnant. After I reached 16 weeks, out of joy and need for emotional support, I told my supervisor and the owner of the business I was pregnant. A week later, I was fired because ""I just wouldn't be happy there due to personality conflicts."" It took me 4 months, without unemployment benefits (which means all of our bills, rent and car payments fell way behind and my husband was pulling 12- to 14-hour shifts, 7 days a week, as well as being threatened with eviction every month) to find another place to work. By that time, my pregnant belly was already showing, and I had very limited choices since I would obviously need maternity leave within a few months. I've been one of the lucky ones who found an office full of new and experienced moms and I was hired and still work there now.

Three of my colleagues stood up for me

In 1998, I was the only female doctor in a medical clinic. When I got pregnant with my first child, the director told me I should find another job because managing a primary care practice after having a baby was not going to be possible. Fortunately for me the clinic nurse manager, a woman, and two of my male colleagues stood up for me. I had to make concessions and be in clinic 5 days a week in order to keep my job though. Twelve years later, I became the clinic director. By then the majority of our physicians were women and motherhood was not only accommodated but celebrated.

I am a better person today because I had kids

I became pregnant with my first daughter in 2015. I was working at a rapidly growing tech company in the Midwest, and I was quickly excelling in my career. The company was mostly male but still had some female representation. The problem was that I was the FIRST female to have a baby (while working there). As soon as I told my boss and HR I was pregnant, fear set in with everyone it seemed. How do we handle this? Where will she be able to pump that's private and NOT a bathroom (which is legally required)? I also learned that the company had a paternity leave policy but NO maternity leave. I could take unpaid FMLA but no paid leave -- I couldn't even save up vacation time to use after having the baby.

Once the management team was aware, I was told to announce this to the team. After the announcement, crickets. I was on an island now. No one knew what to do with me or how to work with me. The first question was, ""Are you leaving?"" At first, I said ""No!"" That answer quickly changed. I ended up quitting that job and staying home with my baby and working as a part-time freelancer for about 3 years. It was wonderful. I will never regret that decision. However, I am now managing a growing agency (based on continuous business growth from freelancing) and I will NEVER put one of my team members in that position. I want flexibility and freedom for moms and dads that I work with. I never want to lose talent and potential because someone chooses to have a child. I know I am a better person today than I was before I had kids. I work harder. I work smarter. And I credit a lot of that to being a mom AND a bad ass businesswoman.

(CNN) Some people are questioning presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's claim that she was basically fired from a teaching job in the early 1970s because she was pregnant. It's hard to imagine that many of them understand what it's like to be a working mother -- then or now.

Kara Alaimo

Media outlets have dug up a 2007 interview in which Sen. Warren recalled that teaching job, saying she remembered thinking ""I don't think this is going to work out for me. I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple years,"" to suggest she left her job of her own volition. That's insane.

Whether she was fired or left because she saw the writing on the wall that her job would be incompatible with motherhood -- and who can blame her for not remembering the precise details of something that happened nearly five decades ago -- the point is that our society makes it extraordinarily tough to be a working mom, especially a new mom. It's bad now, but it was even worse when Warren had her children. She deserves credit for overcoming obstacles that her male opponents simply didn't face. And our next president, whoever that is, needs to be someone who understands these barriers.

I know because I'm a new mom. I have three graduate degrees and have been awarded tenure in my university teaching job. This means that I have much more flexibility than most working moms. Outside of classes, I can name my own office hours and manage to take my baby to the pediatrician during the workday. But, since becoming a mom last year, I've still found it incredibly tough to continue to work.

A big part of the challenge is that the cost of full-time, quality childcare rivals my own take-home pay -- and, as a university professor, my salary vastly exceeds the income of the average American and the salary of schoolteachers in positions like the one Warren held. Many women paying taxes on their own income and then paying a child care provider on the books might actually lose money by going to work -- and that's before taking account of other costs associated with jobs, like commuting and professional clothes. According to Child Care Aware of America, the average cost of child care is over $20,000 per year in most parts of the country . Yet the median income is only $56,000 per year -- before taxes."

It was the most crowded debate stage in the history of US presidential primaries.

Twelve candidates shared the spotlight Tuesday at the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. The event was hosted by CNN and The New York Times on the campus of Otterbein University.

This was the fourth Democratic debate of the campaign season, and it came three and a half months before the Iowa caucuses.

The first two debates had so many candidates that they had to be split up over two nights. But the Democratic National Committee raised the polling and fundraising thresholds that candidates need to qualify.

Those thresholds will be raised once again ahead of next month's debate in Georgia, so Tuesday might have been a make-or-break night for some of the lower-polling candidates."

5. Trump, unleashed: Donald Trump has spent the last week talking and tweeting almost nonstop as he tries to fight his way out of mounting allegations over his pressure campaign to get the Ukrainians to look into debunked allegations of wrongdoing against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

And the rhetoric from Trump has gone to previously unseen heights -- even for Trump. He's accused Rep. Adam Schiff (California) of treason, he's attacked Mitt Romney in deeply personal terms -- more on that directly below -- and he's repeating, repeating, repeating long disproven lies.

All of which means that when Trump travels to Minneapolis on Thursday for a ""Keep America Great"" rally, well, look out. Trump is always at his most, well, Trump-y at these campaign rallies -- and, given the walls closing in on him in Washington, he could well use the Minnesota rally as a venting session the likes of which even longtime Trump observers rarely see.

Stay tuned. It's going to be a doozy.

4. Any other Mitt Romneys out there?: Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a second whistleblower has emerged regarding the President allegedly using the power of his office for political gain during interactions over the summer with Ukraine.

Only Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has publicly criticized Trump in any way, calling the President's urgings of China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens ""wrong"" and ""appalling."" Trump immediately struck back, referring to Romney as a ""pompous 'ass'"" (I have no idea why he put ""ass"" in quotes) and suggesting that the 2012 Republican nominee was ""begging"" to be his secretary of state.

Any Republican who was weighing speaking out about Trump's behavior with Ukraine (and his plea for China to investigate his main rival for the 2020 nomination) now can have no illusions about what such criticism will be met with: Pure, unadulterated anger from Trump -- and likely vilification from the President's base.

Is any prominent Republican other than Romney willing to risk speaking out when that reaction is assured? Principle vs. politics, anyone?

3. Fundraising losers...: With the With the third fundraising quarter ending at the close of last month , most of the major candidates have released how much they brought in and how much they spent between July 1 and September 30.

Let's go through the losers first.

* Joe Biden: When you are a former vice president and the race's frontrunner, you need to be at or very close to the top of the money chase. Biden's $15 million raised in the third quarter is well off the pace and a significant drop-off from when Biden raised $21.5 million from April 1 to June 30 -- his first three months of active fundraising. His numbers will re-ignite the debate over whether he has real grassroots energy behind his establishment candidacy. Think about this: The mayor of South Bend, Indiana -- Pete Buttigieg -- raised $4 million more than Biden in the third quarter and has now out-raised the former vice president for six months straight.

* Cory Booker: The New Jersey senator's plea for $1.7 million in the final days of the quarter -- in order, he said, for him to remain in the race -- drew a ton of publicity. Even though Booker met his goal, he still only brought in $6 million for the entire three-month period. That likely means he will be facing another dire financial deadline in the not-too-distant future.

2. ... and fundraising winners:

* Bernie Sanders: Even as his poll numbers have stagnated somewhat, the Vermont senator's small-dollar, online fundraising network continues to deliver. Sanders topped the field in the third quarter with more than $25 million raised and has now raised more than $71 million this year. That ensures he will not only have real organizations in all of the early states but will also be able to continue fighting for the nomination for months.

* Elizabeth Warren: While Sanders edged out Warren for the top spot by about $500,000, Warren's third quarter fundraising is yet another data point proving how much momentum she has built behind her candidacy. Warren already has the best organization in Iowa, and fundraising like she put on the board over the last three months ensures her campaign will be able to fund a (TV) air assault as well.

* Andrew Yang: The tech entrepreneur raised $10 million in the third quarter, which, at least to me was the single most surprising result of the fundraising race. Yang's total put him well above what Booker, as well as Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Montana) raised, and within shouting distance of Sen. Kamala Harris (California). That's a stunner, and shows how far he's come since the year started and almost no one knew who he was.

1. The age/health debate is here: It was probably inevitable, given that the four most likely candidates to be president in 2021 are 70+ years old, but Bernie Sanders' recent heart attack has officially injected the issue of age and health into the 2020 campaign.

After several days of uncertainty, Sanders' campaign confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and, following his release from the hospital late last week, he has returned to Vermont. His campaign has canceled its events until further notice but has said Sanders will be at the next debate -- set for October 15 in Ohio.

While the relatively advanced ages of Sanders (78), Joe Biden (76) and Elizabeth Warren (70) has been a sort of low buzz in the background of the Democratic race so far, those days are now over. All three candidates had previously pledged to release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, 2020, but the urgency of those releases is significantly higher now than it was even a week ago.

(Remember that Donald Trump was the oldest person ever elected to a first term when he won the presidency in 2016 at age 70. During the campaign, his personal physician released a letter proclaiming that Trump ""would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Trump is now 73. In January of this year, he underwent a physical which found him in ""very good health overall."")"

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said this week he wants to convene hearings to examine allegations of corruption in Ukraine.

""Given the House of Representatives' behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,"" said Graham in a tweet. ""Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.""

(CNN) Tuesday's Democratic debate featured something we have never witnessed before on a presidential debate stage: 15 full minutes of open back-and-forth about how the government should contend with the increasing power of Silicon Valley .

At the center of the exchange was a tussle between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been pushing for the break-up of tech giants like Facebook and Google, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who pointedly asked whether Warren would join her in demanding that Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account on the platform.

This debate moment set the stage for what will doubtless be an election-long spat over what form regulations against internet companies should take.

This is a highly-charged and heavily politicized question, particularly for Democratic candidates. Last month, Facebook formalized a bold new policy that shocked many observers, announcing that the company would not seek to fact-check or censor politicians -- including in the context of paid political advertising, and even during an election season.

Over the past few days, this decree has pushed US political advertising into something like the Wild West: President Donald Trump, who will likely face the Democratic candidate in next year's general election, has already taken the opportunity to spread political lies with no accountability.

A frightening new world of political communication

In the aftermath of Facebook's announcement, Trump's presidential campaign disseminated an advertisement on Facebook's platform claiming that 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden had used his power as vice president to try to influence Ukraine to help his son, Hunter Biden.

The ""facts"" behind the Trump advertisement implicating Biden — which has been viewed on Facebook no fewer than five million times — have been definitively debunked , and CNN declined to air the ad for that reason.

This new Facebook policy opens a frightening new world for political communication — and for national politics. It is now the case that leading politicians can openly spread political lies without repercussion. Indeed, the Trump campaign was already spreading other falsehoods through online advertising immediately before Facebook made its announcement — and as one might predict, most of those advertisements have not been removed from the platform.

Should our politicians fail to reform regulations for internet platforms and digital advertising, our political future will be at risk. The 2016 election revealed the tremendous harm to the American democratic process that can result from coordinated misinformation campaigns ; 2020 will be far worse if we do nothing to contain the capacity for politicians to lie on social media.

The same capabilities by which political campaigns sliced up audience segments in 2016 via Facebook's advertisements will continue to exist in 2020. The difference will be that this time, the lies can be distributed by agents of the Trump campaign, instead of shell accounts operated by the Russian government and others.

Facebook's derogation of fact-checking will thus only lend greater credibility to coordinated disinformation operations — as in the case of the recent Trump campaign ad.

Warren responded to the Trump ad with a cheeky point: In an ad she has circulated over Facebook, she claims that ""Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election."" Later in the ad, she acknowledges this is a falsehood, and contends that ""what [Mark] Zuckerberg has done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform — and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.""

Warren's mockery of the ad — and of the underlying policy that allowed its dissemination — helps illuminate how Facebook's new policy will have grave implications for our political future. Facebook's decision not to take down the Trump ad amounts to knowingly enabling the insidious political manipulation of American voters.

Facebook's power and ""free expression""

The irony is that Facebook already censors advertisements -- including those placed by presidential campaigns in the United States -- for a host of reasons. One investigation found that the company had taken down paid content from four of the Democratic candidates, including 117 ads that had been placed by the Biden campaign, for reasons ranging from the use of profanity to the display of fake buttons.

It is disconcerting to think that by fiat, Facebook can deem a political ad to be dishonest because it contains fake buttons (which can deceive the viewer into clicking on a survey button when in fact there is no interactive feature in the ad), but the company will refuse to take action against ads containing widely-debunked political lies, even during an American presidential election.

This perilous inconsistency in Facebook's policy decisions is a sign that its corporate power has grown too great. Concern for the public interest and the health of our democracy should compel us to action. And the only entity that has the power to do anything to improve the situation for the American people is Congress.

Facebook has one principal counterargument against regulation: that the company must maintain strong commitments to free speech and freedom of political expression. This came across in Mark Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University on Thursday, in which he described social media as a kind of ""Fifth Estate"" and characterized politicians' calls to take action as an attempt to restrict freedom of expression. Quoting at times from Frederick Douglass and Supreme Court jurisprudence, Zuckerberg said ""we are at a crossroads"" and asserted: ""When it's not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of free expression.""

Unfortunately for Facebook, this argument holds little water. If you determine that an ad containing a fake button is non-compliant because it ""[entices] users to select an answer,"" then you certainly should not knowingly broadcast ads that entice voters to unwittingly consume publicly-known lies -- whether they are distributed by the President or any other politician. Indeed, as one official in Biden's presidential campaign has noted , Zuckerberg's argumentation amounts to an insidious ""choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression"" to ""use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

Behind what the company claims to be a commitment to free speech lies a commercial convenience.

Regulatory policy is the way forward

If Facebook cannot take appropriate action and remove paid political lies from its platform, the only answer must be earnest regulation of the company -- regulation that forces Facebook to be transparent about the nature of political ads and prevents it from propagating political falsehoods, even if they are enthusiastically distributed by President Trump.

Our nation has always aspired to place the interests of our democratic purpose over the interests of markets. Silicon Valley should be no exception."

The people familiar told the paper that witnesses have been questioned by investigators since at least August about Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer.

Part of the questioning involves any potential role Giuliani played in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates , Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were indicted on campaign finance-related charges last week.

The Journal's report builds on reporting from The New York Times l ast week that Giuliani is facing an investigation by federal prosecutors into whether his involvement with Ukraine violated federal lobbying laws.

Giuliani told CNN on Monday that he was unsure if prosecutors were looking into his work with the mayor of Kharkiv, with whom he had met on a December 2017 trip as part of his international consulting business.

""It was a security report focusing on an emergency management center which was concluded in (December) or so 2017. I have no knowledge they are looking at it but let them. Maybe they should ask me instead of leaking it (if they are doing it) and I can save them unnecessary work,"" Giuliani said.

When asked if he was aware of prosecutors looking into any other area of his Ukraine business dealings, Giuliani told CNN, ""No l don't think they are but my bank records are fine.""

The former New York mayor has faced a wave of scrutiny following the release of a whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

The whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani a ""central figure"" in the controversy.

US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials. The whistleblower alleges that US officials believed Giuliani was a conduit for messages between the President and officials in Kiev and that he was at the helm of a problematic ""circumvention of national security decision making processes.""

Giuliani has previously told CNN he has ""no knowledge of any of that crap"" in the complaint."

(CNN) As the Republic of Venice slowly slid into the 18th century, its economic power was waning while military threats piled up all around it. Inside the city, though, it maintained a vibrant cultural and political life.

When its elites, visiting nobility, and the lower status citizens of the city wanted to mingle, they all would put on masks. Far from the elaborate contraptions sold on every corner in the touristy city, mostly these masks didn't do much to conceal identity. Instead, they provided a polite fiction that allowed people to cross social lines without threatening social norms. Early modern Venetians had masks; today, politicians have Twitter.

Last week, Sen. Mitt Romney told The Atlantic writer McKay Coppins that he had a secret Twitter account , offering just enough details that Ashley Feinberg, who writes for Slate, could deduce its identity . Feinberg reasoned that Romney would want to follow his family members, including his grandchildren, some of whom have relatively few followers. Feinberg introduced us to Twitter user @qaws9876 , aka Pierre Delecto. When Coppins confronted Romney with the deduction, the senator replied only, ""C'est moi"" (or ""it's me,"" in French).

The revelations about Romney's activity on Twitter come at a curious time for the ""sometimes Trump"" Republican caucus, whose ranks include Romney. These Republicans, who include both lawmakers and writers , took principled positions against the president when he was running for the GOP nomination, mostly backed him against Clinton or suggested they might futilely write-in another option.

Since Trump's election, they have oscillated back and forth from quiescent subjugation to periodic public complaint about presidential conduct. These complaints never seem to result in Republicans organizing against Trump from within. Only rarely has this cohort voted against Trump's norms in Congress ( with a few notable exceptions ) and never have they publicly campaigned for Democrats. In fact, as Elizabeth Warren seems to have emerged as at least a co-frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, most ""Sometimes Trump"" writers seem to be setting themselves up to reluctantly support the president

But now with Trump and his cronies — both staff like Mick Mulvaney and on-again off-again personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani — almost daily confessing to transgressions, it's both easier for Republicans like Romney to stand against the president and harder for him to stay quiet.

Twitter is a performative space, at least if you have a public account. Whereas Facebook has sophisticated layering of privacy options — often bewildering to the casual user — that encourage participation within closed, selected, networks of mutual connections, Twitter promotes the short, loud blast. It's a place that works very well for sharing news and for making like-minded connections. Its public nature also comes with the serious risk of harassment and bullying.

His mask had come off, but he hadn't used this private account to do anything especially significant. Pierre Delecto only tweeted 10 times. Feinberg noted that a number of responses were aimed at journalists directly criticizing Romney and other Republicans for a lack of spine in the face of Trump's flagrant misconduct. Wait and see, Romney seemed to suggest, but there's nothing revelatory here. We've been waiting to see for a long time.

I'm a historian of pre-modern Venice and often think about the efforts that medieval democracy undertook to maintain social order, protect their electoral systems, and thrive in a fraught space between different spheres of power (Rome, the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantium and then the Ottomans, Catholics versus Protestants, and more over the centuries).

Their masks have enhanced a reputation for secrecy and debauchery, that ""anything goes"" once the masks are on. In the recent book, ""Venice Incognito,"" though, historian James Johnson argues that masks were in many cases a tool of the status quo, ""permitting contact among unequals through fictive concealment. Rather than obscuring identities, masks affirmed their permanence."" The donning of a mask created a fiction that affirmed social structures, rather than threatening them.

Mitt Romney and a handful of other Republican leaders have a chance to act. But they are going to have do so without masks and, most critically, they are going to have to risk upsetting their own delicate position. Romney and the rest will have to stop performing principled resistance and actually resist. Trump will eventually be gone, but for America to move past this difficult moment, all the masks must come off."

471,"Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business",,"Some business leaders, inlcuding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have expressed reservations about Elizabeth Warren. But others argue that even if she goes on to win the presidency, that won't be a problem for Wall Street or the economy.",2019-10-11,CNN,What would an Elizabeth Warren presidency mean for the economy and markets? - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/investing/elizabeth-warren-stock-market-economy/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The possibility that Elizabeth Warren could win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination — and perhaps even defeat Donald Trump — is starting to unnerve some in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.

But would a President Warren actually be a bad thing for big business and the stock market?

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees this summer that a Warren White House would not be good for the social media networking company, because of her calls to break upand other big tech companies.

Tech news site The Verge reported earlier this month that, according to leaked audio clips, Zuckerberg said ""if [Warren] gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah.""

And a recent survey by RBC Capital Markets showed that investors are nervous about Joe Biden's poll numbers and Warren's ascent.

""Investors clearly think Biden is better for the stock market than Warren,"" said Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in the report. In fact, Warren was viewed as ""the least market friendly"" candidate, Calvasina noted.

Warren has a populist platform and has talked about doing more to regulate the financial, tech, health care and energy industries. She has also proposed a wealth tax of 2% annually on households with a net worth above $50 million and 3% on households with a net worth higher than $1 billion.

So it's understandable why Wall Street has concerns about Warren.

The reasons why Warren wouldn't tank the stock market

Still, some experts think that worries about Warren are way overdone.

For one, few believe that the Senate will flip to Democratic control in 2020 — even if President Trump loses his reelection bid.

So there are limits to how much a President Warren could do with executive orders if Congress is split, said Matt Daly, a managing director and head of corporate credit research at Conning.

And a Warren win could boost some parts of the market and economy, Daly told CNN Business. He pointed to clean energy and infrastructure as sectors that likely would benefit if Warren were to win the race for the White House.

Even though Mark Zuckerberg may not be a fan of the Massachusetts senator, other leaders in the tech industry support Warren's candidacy.

Big Tech starting to warm to Warren

According to a Vox/Recode story earlier this month, numerous tech insiders said they liked Warren because of her rigorous approach to coming up with policy ideas. Many also viewed her as a more palatable alternative to Bernie Sanders, who is also on the far-left, progressive side of the Democratic party.

Alphabet GOOGL Amazon AMZN Apple AAPL Microsoft MSFT AT&T T Disney DIS IBM IBM To that end, employees and PACs tied to Google ownerandare listed by the Center for Responsive Politics' OpenSecrets.org site as among the biggest donors to Warren's campaign. CNN ownerandwere also among the top 20 contributors.

Analysts at tech, media and telecom research firm MoffettNathanson don't seem worried about Warren either, noting that there's a difference between campaign rhetoric and actual policy.

""We're relatively sanguine. Sure, a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks. But a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks for lots of industries,"" the MoffettNathanson analysts said in a report. The analysts added that ""her platform has more planks than a pirate ship; she's got plans for everything.""

Warren has also talked tough about China. That actually could be good for the markets, despite current concerns about the trade war.

Even though Trump's tactic of imposing more tariffs on China has hurt American companies and consumers — including from China's retaliatory measures — there is support in the business community for Washington to enforce intellectual property rights more forcefully with Beijing.

Warren would probably continue that approach. So it may not be in China's best interests to drag out trade talks and hope that it will no longer have to deal with Trump in 2021 if Warren continues to gain ground in the polls.

""There is growing consensus that China may hold out, trying to 'run out the clock' on the Trump administration through next November. These dynamics are changing, however, as Elizabeth Warren emerges and Joe Biden fades,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, in a report this week.

""Warren is running on populist policies and could be as challenging an adversary to the Chinese than Trump,"" Hackett added.

Continued pressure on China in a Warren White House?

A likely strong approach to dealing with China is a key reason why Kyle Bass, founder of the Hayman Capital Management hedge fund, said he is backing Warren too.

Bass told CNN Business in August that he would ""immediately"" vote for Warren because of her stance on China. She has criticized the country's environmental and labor/human rights policies and has also accused China of currency manipulation.

It's also worth noting that Wall Street was initially wary of Barack Obama in 2008 because of similar fears about the prospects for tougher regulations on the health care and financial sectors. (Of course, Wall Street was scared about lots of things unrelated to politics in 2008, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Great Recession.)

But the Obama presidency wound up being far more friendly to businesses than many had expected. So the same thing could happen if Warren wins the White House."

Joe Biden (D) has been under fire in recent days after it was reported that his campaign dropped short of $1 million – $924,000 – on private jet usage in the third quarter (July 1 – September 30) alone. The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show.

While Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly spent just short of $500,000 – $479,000 – on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the Hill.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000– $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) – who once described climate change as the “greatest threat to our national security” – spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) – who described climate change as an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” – also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the Hill that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter.

An outline of the Democrat-backed Green New Deal, released this year, lamented the existence of cows and air travel but admitted that neither could be totally eliminated.

The outline stated:

We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

The excessive air travel of the candidates calls their authenticity into question.

Warren has called climate change an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” and called for “bold action now to stop it before it’s too late”:

Climate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us—and we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a #ClimateDebate. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 24, 2019

Biden – who spent nearly $1 million on private jet usage in a three-month span – warned that it is going to take “leadership” to combat the “climate crisis”:

It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/aXvhwUDHMq — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 5, 2019

Harris has called climate change an “imminent threat to our planet,” while Buttigieg warned that the threat “isn’t theoretical”:

Climate change is an imminent threat to our planet unless we correct course. It’s within our power to do so. Now is the time. pic.twitter.com/q1mToVv6GE — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 18, 2019

Climate change isn't theoretical. Parts of California are on fire, in Florida they're talking about sea level rise.

Sanders, who unveiled a $16 trillion climate change proposal in August, called President Trump an “idiot” for not taking climate change seriously:

Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2019

Nevertheless, critics argue that Democrats are demonstrating that they are not taking the matter seriously, as their actions do not always coincide with their rhetoric.

For instance, Democrats came under fire last month after attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, which featured thousands of steaks. While climate change alarmists argue that red meat consumption is contributing to the “crisis,” several Democrat candidates happily assisted in grilling the juicy cuts of meat, despite some of the presidential hopefuls previously floating limiting beef consumption in order to curb the looming threat:

State Department inspector… [+7723 chars]","Tuesday saw a burst of news involving President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Rudy Giuliani and the House Democratic impeachment inquiry as it enters its second week.",2019-10-02,CNN,Here's what happened in another wild day of the Trump-Ukraine scandal,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/01/politics/ukraine-guide-rudy-giuliani-trump-whistleblower/index.html,"Washington (CNN) There has been a flurry of news involving President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Rudy Giuliani and the House Democratic impeachment inquiry as it enters its second week. Here's the latest:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: 'I was on the phone call' with Trump and Ukrainian President

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted Wednesday that he was on the July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

""I was on the phone call,"" Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy's foreign minister.

Some key context: A whistleblower complaint released last week alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

A rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

State Department inspector general requests urgent briefing on Ukraine with congressional staff

The State Department's inspector general on Tuesday requested an urgent briefing with senior congressional staff members after Pompeo pushed back on House Democratic demands to turn over documents related to Ukraine and to depose current and former State officials, according to sources briefed on the matter.

It remains unclear exactly what State Department Inspector General Steve Linick plans to provide Congress during the private briefing Wednesday.

Deposition for House impeachment investigation delayed

The aide said on Tuesday the testimony of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, would now occur Oct. 11, following an agreement between the committee's and the former ambassador's counsel.

Three committees -- the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight panels -- have scheduled the depositions as part of their probe into whether Trump solicited help from a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political opponent.

Yovanovitch and Volker were two of the five depositions that the committees have scheduled during the next two weeks while Congress is on recess.

Giuliani hires a Watergate prosecutor as his attorney in impeachment inquiry

Florida attorney Jon Sale , who worked as an assistant prosecutor on the legal team investigating the Watergate scandal, is representing Giuliani in the matter of the congressional impeachment inquiry, both of them confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.

Giuliani was subpoenaed on Monday by the three committees in the House of Representatives investigating Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian government. The subpoena requests documents and correspondence from Giuliani related to Ukraine.

As a reminder, the whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani as ""central figure"" in the controversy. US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials.

Key GOP senator breaks with Trump in saying the whistleblower 'ought to be heard out and protected'

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chamber's most senior Republican and a longtime defender of whistleblowers, rebuked Trump on Tuesday when he said the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry ""appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.""

His comments mark a clear departure from Trump and his allies, who in recent days have repeatedly maligned the whistleblower's motives and pushed to reveal the individual's identity.

Ukraine's President says he never met with Giuliani

""I never met Rudy Giuliani -- never. And never had any phone calls with him,"" Zelensky said Tuesday at a news conference in Kiev.

According to the White House transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, the Ukrainian President said he was aware of Giuliani's efforts to uncover information that would help Trump politically, and Trump encouraged Zelensky to speak with his lawyer because Giuliani ""very much knows what's happening.""

Pompeo accuses House Democrats of intimidation and bullying over Ukraine controversy

""I'm concerned with aspects of the Committee's request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs,"" he tweeted.

The comments prompted House Democrats to issue a stark warning to the top US diplomat. The chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees told Pompeo that any effort to prevent those officials from speaking to Congress ""is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.""

CNN reported Monday that Pompeo was on Trump's July call with Zelensky despite previously denying knowledge of the whistleblower complaint.

More news around Washington

How Lindsey Graham's support for Trump -- a man he once called a 'jackass' -- has evolved

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is one of Trump's most vociferous defenders on Capitol Hill, but it wasn't always like that. In fact, Graham called Trump ""crazy and a ""jackass"" four years ago when he was running in the GOP presidential primary.

At the time, Trump wasn't so kind to Graham either, calling him a ""nut job.""

""This guy Lindsey Graham, he's one of the dumbest human beings I have ever seen,"" Trump said at a rally in South Carolina. ""He starts hitting me, saying vicious things, ends up with 0%. He left in disgrace.""

Don't assume the Senate would *never* impeach Trump

With the House headed down a path that virtually guarantees Trump will be impeached, conventional wisdom has settled on the idea that the Republican-led Senate will never, ever, remove him from office.

And, well, it's true that the strong likelihood is that the Senate acquits Trump, CNN's Chris Cillizza writes.

But if the Trump presidency -- and the way in which he became President -- teaches us anything, it should be this: Never assume. Anything.

Fact-checking Trump's false claim that the US is the only country providing aid to Ukraine

Trump has offered several explanations to justify his decision to delay military aid to Ukraine, first suggesting he was worried about ""corruption,"" then claiming the delay was a mechanism to pressure other countries to contribute.

On September 23, Trump voiced his complaint to reporters alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda, asking, ""Why is it always the United States spending money?"" and ""I don't like it that it's only us.""

Facts First: The US is not ""the only one"" contributing aid to Ukraine. Germany and France have both sent millions of euros to Ukraine, along with other European nations.

Connected by subpoenas: Giuliani and his Ukrainian middleman Lev Parnas face increased scrutiny

Parnas, a Ukrainian American businessman who has been subpoenaed as part of the House impeachment inquiry, has spent thousands of dollars on Trump properties and donated to the main super PAC supporting the President's reelection effort, according to documents produced in an unrelated federal lawsuit.

Starting in November 2018, Parnas introduced Giuliani to former and current Ukrainian officials, according to Giuliani.

Financial records uncovered as a result of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Florida earlier this year show Parnas spent thousands of dollars at Trump hotels in the fall of 2018, donated hundreds of thousands to the pro-Trump super PAC and received checks from Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep connections to the Trump White House.

The financial ties between Trump's world and Parnas raise new questions about the nature of Parnas' relationship with Giuliani and who was paying the former New York mayor and Parnas for their research on Ukraine."

He cautioned ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate that Democrat candidates need to tell voters how they will practically implement their lofty policy proposals.

Bloomberg wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post urging Democrat candidates to explain how they would make their grandiose proposals a reality.

The former mayor said it is likely the next president will face a “closely divided Congress.” Because of that, candidates need to explain how they would implement their ideas – such as Medicare for All and their multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposals.

“Rarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,” Bloomberg wrote.

“The fact is: A legislative proposal is only as good as the execution plan that accompanies it. And even the best plans must be flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes, to prevent the perfect from being the enemy of the good,” he continued.

He added:

The presidential aspirants are not short on big ideas. But voters must demand they explain how they intend to move from proposing plans to actually implementing them, including passing them through Congress. Those who dodge the question by speaking of revolution and the bully pulpit aren’t up to the job.

The op-ed follows reports of Bloomberg’s rumored reconsideration of a presidential bid. While he announced his intention of staying out of the presidential race due to the “difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field” in March, Biden’s slow and steady fall has the former mayor rethinking his decision.

Bloomberg has told associates that he is considering throwing his hat in the presidential ring of Biden drops out.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a source, described as a “New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,” told CNBC.

As CNBC reported:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

While Biden has not signaled any intention to drop out of the race, his lackluster debate performance is not expected to elevate his position in the polls. The former vice president failed to have a breakout moment during the three-hour debate and experienced at least seven gaffes, mistakenly pronouncing exponentially as “expodentially,” mentioning Roe. v Wade before correcting himself to the subject of gun sales, and claiming that people are “clipping coupons in the stock market” during a discussion on the economy:

If Bloomberg does, in fact, jump into the presidential ring in coming months, he would likely face questions surrounding his recent praise of China– particularly that Chinese Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping is “not a dictator”:

485,"Brian Fung, CNN",,"A days-long feud between Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Facebook intensified over the weekend as Warren openly accused the company of ""taking money to promote lies.""",2019-10-13,CNN,Elizabeth Warren escalates Facebook ad feud,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/13/politics/elizabeth-warren-facebook-feud/index.html,"(CNN) A days-long feud between Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Facebook intensified over the weekend as Warren openly accused the company of ""taking money to promote lies.""

Warren, a leading Democratic 2020 candidate, has taken aim at the social media giant over its role in spreading disinformation against her and other candidates. Her campaign ran an ad on Facebook this past week that contained a deliberate lie to draw further attention to the issue.

That provocative move came after a recording leaked earlier this month of CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling employees that a Warren presidency would ""suck"" for the company.

Facebook fired back at Warren over the weekend via another social media platform, Twitter, where the company compared itself to broadcast television stations that ran the Trump ad and are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.

The ""FCC doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech,"" Facebook said in a tweet. ""We agree it's better to let voters -- not companies -- decide.""

The comparison opened the door to additional scrutiny of Facebook's role in handling political speech. Facebook declined to comment for this story.

In response, Warren said the company's decision to compare itself to heavily regulated broadcasters raised even more questions about how it should be managed.

""You're making my point here,"" she tweeted. ""It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.""

The episode underscores how Facebook is trying to maintain its position as a neutral platform even as it acquires ever more influence over public discourse and information -- and as it seeks to address weaknesses that made it a vehicle for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Under current policy, Facebook exempts ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking -- a loophole, Warren says, that allows Zuckerberg to continue taking ""gobs of money"" from President Donald Trump's campaign despite Trump's ads telling untruths about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump's efforts to pursue unfounded claims about the Bidens are at the heart of the burgeoning impeachment inquiry facing the President.

The Warren fight over ads highlights the collapsing distinction between traditional broadcast media and 21st-century digital platforms, experts say, raising fresh questions about how decades-old regulations concerning political speech should apply to massive online platforms that can influence millions of voters.

And according to some legal analysts, it exposes the limits of Facebook's arguments that it is not a media company.

Beginning with the Radio Act of 1927, Congress mandated that radio stations, and later TV stations, cannot pick and choose which political candidates' ads to run.

Broadcasters may choose not to air political ads at all, though that is rare in today's media environment and the law still requires them to carry ads by federal candidates, said Harold Feld, senior vice president at the technology think tank Public Knowledge. But broadcasters that do accept political ads must air all advertisements from qualified candidates, without a view toward their truthfulness or accuracy.

Broadcasters can still decline to air political ads from non-candidates, such as political action committees. And none of these rules apply to cable networks, which is why CNN could legally decline to air the Trump ad.

Facebook's comparison to broadcasters raises difficult questions about whether it is appropriate to import rules meant for TV and radio stations to the internet, Feld said.

""We face the same choices that we had when radio and television were the big gatekeepers,"" he said. ""How much discretion do you want to give to these powerful shapers of public opinion while still being faithful to the principles of the First Amendment and letting the public decide?""

Broadcasters also obey a slew of other rules that companies such as Facebook do not, Feld said -- should Facebook have to comply with those as well?

For example, the government limits how many stations a media company may own in a particular market to limit anti-competitive behavior. Other FCC regulations require broadcasters to air a certain amount of children's programming, or to air sensitive content only after certain hours.

For a platform that targets content to users based on their interests and according to detailed data, reworking such rules for Facebook could be immensely complex and perhaps inadvisable, said Andrew Schwartzman, senior counselor to the Benton Foundation Institute for Broadband & Society, a civil society group.

""You can't apply that effectively, probably, to cable -- but certainly not to internet platforms,"" he said. ""It's just impossible.""

Facebook's reference to broadcasters also highlights a double standard. Schwartzman added that Facebook wants the benefit of the doubt afforded to regulated broadcasters, but ""without the responsibility of being a regulated broadcaster.""

Even those who have represented the broadcast industry say it is an odd and challenging position for Facebook to adopt.

""Facebook obviously doesn't want to be regulated like a broadcaster, so in a way it's strange they're citing this,"" said Jack Goodman, a former general counsel for the National Association of Broadcasters. ""Because they're not regulated, and they certainly don't want to be regulated.""

Warren's ads, which began running widely on Thursday, started with a bold but obvious falsehood: That Facebook and Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump's reelection campaign.

""You're probably shocked,"" read the ad, which reached tens of thousands of viewers nationwide. ""And you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not.""

On Saturday, Warren explained her ad was meant ""to see just how far"" the policy goes.

""We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook's ad platform to see if it'd be approved,"" she tweeted. ""It got approved quickly."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidate, says transgender border crossers and illegal aliens “must” be released into the United States.

Warren, with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) where she demands that transgender border crossers and illegal aliens be released into the U.S. rather than being held in Mexico under President Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy.

“While in detention, transgender migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment, discrimination, and abuse,” Warren writes in the letter. “The United States should protect individuals fleeing persecution and targeted violence, including persecution based on gender identity or expression — not subject them to further harm.”

“Trans migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable,” Warren wrote on Twitter. “We must end unnecessary detention and enforce strict standards to keep trans migrants and asylum seekers safe — and I’ll continue holding our government accountable when they fail to do so.”

The demand for transgender border crossers to be released into the U.S. interior is the latest case Warren has made for open borders while on the campaign trail.

Most recently, Warren outlined a plan to provide back pay to all illegal aliens who are determined to have been underpaid or unpaid for previous work, Breitbart News reported. Likewise, Warren has said that border crossers must not be “unnecessarily” detained and instead freed into the interior of the U.S. and has claimed that driving up foreign competition in the labor market by providing amnesty to 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens is “good” for American workers.

Though Warren has taken a populist-nationalist stance on various economic policies, her plan to support more immigration to the U.S. is a key component of the globalist agenda supported by the nation’s donor class.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday unveiled her public education proposal, which includes halting the “privatization” of public schools, stopping vouchers, enhancing protections for illegal immigrant students, and quadrupling Title I funding.

While there are many facets to Warren’s plan, she devotes a significant section to combating the “privatization” of public schools. It is necessary, Warren says, to “resist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools.” She continued:

To keep our traditional public school systems strong, we must resist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools. Efforts to expand the footprint of charter schools, often without even ensuring that charters are subject to the same transparency requirements and safeguards as traditional public schools, strain the resources of school districts and leave students behind, primarily students of color.

Because of that, Warren is calling for the end of vouchers, tuition tax credits, and federally-funded expansions of charter schools. She also calls for a full ban of for-profit charter schools.

“We should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits – which are vouchers by another name,” she wrote.

“We should fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation’s schools,” she added.

That stands in contrast with the position Warren took in the past, particularly ahead of her 2012 senatorial campaign. She actually championed vouchers and assessed that they “take pressure off parents” in terms of having to purchase homes in neighborhoods zoned for desirable schools. She added that vouchers encourage competition and produce results, creating something “parents can buy into and believe in.”

Warren also painted a dire picture of a public education system, where both segregation and discrimination are, she believes, running rampant.

“But broad public affirmation of the Brown v. Board of Education decisions in the 1950s and recent debates about historical desegregation policies have obscured an uncomfortable truth – our public schools are more segregated today than they were about thirty years ago,” Warren claimed, weaving in her “Housing Plan for America” as a viable solution for these issues and ignoring her past calls for vouchers, which 2011 Warren suggested would help remedy the disparity.

Additionally, the presidential hopeful’s plan enhances protections for illegal immigrant students, calling the Trump administration’s immigration policies “inhumane” and attributing them to the increase of fear among illegal immigrant families. She said:

Immigration makes America stronger – economically, socially, and culturally. But because of the Trump Administration’s inhumane immigration policies, many immigrant students are afraid to go to school, and many families living in the shadows are afraid to access resources like free school lunch. I would end the Trump’s Administration’s monstrous policies and enact immigration reform that is fair, humane, and reflects our values. I will ensure immigrant students don’t get second-class status by being directed into GED programs instead of classrooms. I will protect sensitive locations like schools from immigrant enforcement actions. And I’ll recommit OCR to upholding and enforcing Plyler v. Doe – which the Trump administration has tried to undermine – so that all immigrant children have access to a quality education, no matter their native language, national origin, immigration status, or educational history.

She also promises to affirm the rights of LGBT students by reinstating the “guidance revoked under Trump about transgender students’ rights under Title IX, and make clear that federal civil rights law prohibits anti-LGBTQ+ rules like discriminatory dress codes, prohibiting students from writing or discussing LGBTQ+ topics in class, or punishing students for bringing same-sex partners to school events.”

In another section, Warren pledges to push a guidance that would “limit the use of discriminatory dress codes targeting student dress and hairstyle,” which she says leads to “students of color losing valuable learning time and Muslim students being denied participation in school activities.”

Warren’s plan also proposes the cancelation of student breakfast and lunch debt, as well as free school meals and free universal pre-K, which she has said she would pay for via her “wealth tax.”

“It’s time to live up to the promise of a high-quality public education for every student,” Warren wrote. “My plan makes big, structural changes that would help give every student the resources they need to thrive.”"

Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday detailed a new environmental justice plan aimed at bolstering and protecting vulnerable communities on the front lines of the climate crisis.

""Our crisis of environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long,"" Warren writes in a Medium post.

The Massachusetts Democrat would direct one-third of her proposed climate investment to the most vulnerable communities, which she writes would funnel at least $1 trillion into those areas over the next decade.

Warren's Wednesday release offers new insight into how she would use presidential powers to orchestrate what climate activists often call a ""just transition"" toward a green energy economy. While covering a broad range of policy issues, the post is primarily focused on what her administration would do to prioritize neighborhoods, cities and entire regions with heavy minority populations -- many of them still suffering from the effects of racist policies like redlining, which often placed families of color in harm's way.

Throughout her campaign, Warren has frequently sought to weave in detailed proposals directed specifically at communities of color. Here, she warns that ""'one-size-fits-all' solutions,"" though often well-intentioned, open up space for the exploitation of those minorities and the poor. Because of that, Warren argues, more narrowly ""targeted"" policies are required.

Don't lose sight of this amazing fact: Astronaut and first-time Senate candidate Mark Kelly had more money in the bank ($9.5 million) than Joe Biden's presidential campaign ( $8.98 million ) at the end of September.

That's Joe Biden. The three-plus decade senator. The eight-year vice president. The front-runner in the 2020 race since the moment he got into it. (Until now, that is. More on that below.)

Biden's fundraising problems aren't actually all that surprising. He's never been much of a fundraiser -- or enjoyed doing it. And he never built the small-dollar national network that more liberal candidates likes Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have accrued.

None of those rationalizations change the fact that Biden has considerably less money to spend in the final 100 days before people start voting that any of his top rivals -- including Sanders, Warren and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

How can Biden change that reality? He probably can't. If he wasn't able to raise money well (and easily) as the clear front-runner, he's going to have a much harder time convincing people to give him money given the changing dynamics in the contest.

4. Bernie's back?: That's the message coming out of Sanders' campaign as he seeks to change the subject from his recent heart attack and the is-he-too-old-for-this? conversation that event has spurred.

Sanders' efforts to move on got a big boost over the weekend when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him over Warren. ""It wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,"" Ocasio-Cortez said at a rally announcing her 2020 pick

What happens next? Well, Sanders has the AOC endorsement as well as $30+ million in the bank -- two very good things with about 100 days left until Iowa. The question now becomes: Does he have another issue on the campaign trail related to his health or age? If not, Sanders' heart attack might seem like a million years ago by the time Iowa Democrats turn out to vote in the caucuses. But if Sanders has any sort of problem between now and then, it's likely the end of his campaign.

3. The super-weird Hillary vs. Tulsi dynamic: Hillary Clinton started Hillary Clinton started one of the strangest news cycles in the 2020 race at the end of the last week when she seemed to suggest that the Russians were ""grooming"" Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate. Gabbard, thrilled with the unexpected chance to battle with one of the biggest figures in the party, called Clinton the ""queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.""

What now? Well, Buttigieg gave the story a bit more fuel Sunday morning. ""I don't know what the basis is for that,"" he said of Gabbard on CNN's ""State of the Union"" with Jake Tapper. ""But I consider her to be a competitor. I respect her service.""

Does this become a story that all of the major contenders on the Democratic side have to respond to? And do any of them take it as an opportunity to distance themselves from the Clinton era that many Democrats would like to put behind them?

2. Trump slump ... dump?: I'm hesitant to predict any sort of major walk-away from President Donald Trump by congressional Republicans over the Ukraine scandal because, well, they haven't walked away from him over all of the other terrible stories surrounding him over his first three-ish years in office.

And yet, there are cracks. Over the weekend, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced that he supported the impeachment and removal of Trump. Florida Rep. Francis Rooney, a Republican, said he would consider impeaching Trump -- and then promptly announced his plan to retire from Congress in 2020

The question is whether any more fissures emerge following Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's admission that there was a quid pro quo between the US and Ukraine to force an investigation into the Democratic National Committee's physical server. (Trump -- and Mulvaney, I suppose? -- believe the server might be in Ukraine. It's not.

There is somewhat clear evidence that Trump is melting down amid the pressures applied by the House impeachment inquiry. The latest evidence? His Saturday night reversal on plans announced Thursday to hold the 2020 G7 summit at his Doral club in Miami.

Is there any scenario in which Republicans say enough is enough and begin to break from Trump publicly in big numbers? If it's possible, we might be on the verge of it.

1. The new Democratic front-runner ... now what?: There's a new top dog in the Democratic field: Elizabeth Warren. There's a new top dog in the Democratic field: Elizabeth Warren. As Harry Enten and I noted in our brandnew rankings of the 10 Democrats most likely to wind up as the party's nominee, Warren has overtaken Biden not just in polling but also in money and organization. She also has the clearest path to be the nominee, with a polling and organizational edges in Iowa and a geographic connection in New Hampshire.

So now what? Well, last week's debate is an indicator of what this next phase of the Democratic race will look like -- as the Massachusetts senator was attacked for a variety of her positions by no fewer than seven of her rivals. (Warren did the best she could amid the onslaught, but no one could be expected to prosper under those circumstances.)

Warren's most obvious weakness -- from a policy perspective -- is on her ongoing unwillingness to state, clearly, whether or not middle-class families will see their taxes go up under her ""Medicare for All"" plan. The answer to that is almost certainly yes -- as Sanders, another ""Medicare for All"" proponent, acknowledged in the debate."

(CNN) Within the first 10 minutes of Tuesday's fourth presidential debate, you could tell something fundamental had changed in the race: Elizabeth Warren is the new front-runner.

The Massachusetts senator was attacked from all sides from the get-go -- on how she planned to fund her ""Medicare for All"" plan, on the ""punitive"" nature of her policy solutions, and on her supposed claims to be the only one in the field who had bold ideas.

By our count, at least seven other candidates on the stage attacked Warren at some point during the three-hour debate. That dynamic ensured that the fourth debate wouldn't be as successful for Warren as the previous three -- no one can take that amount of incoming and emerge unscathed -- but also proved, very clearly, that no matter what the polls show, her rivals believe her to be the one to beat in this race.

We've reflected that changed reality in our latest 2020 rankings. Below, the 10 men and women with the best chance of emerging as the Democratic nominee in 2020.

And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it.",2019-10-16,CNN,7 takeaways from the debate,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/october-democratic-debate-highlights/index.html,"Westerville, Ohio (CNN) Polls show that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination . And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it.

The party's fourth presidential debate , hosted by CNN and The New York Times, showcased the shifting dynamics of the Democratic primary. Warren was under attack all night -- though it's far from clear whether anyone dented her status at the top of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden , the other front-runner, stayed out of the fray for much of the event -- until a late clash with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that featured the same one-on-one, progressive-against-moderate battle that defined the 2016 Democratic contest.

And moderate candidates -- some, like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, fighting to climb into the top tier; others, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, just desperate to make the next debate stage -- dropped the euphemisms and pressed their progressive foes in direct and sometimes personal terms.

Here are seven takeaways from Tuesday night's debate:

Warren under attack for the first time

JUST WATCHED Warren attacked from all sides on the debate stage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren attacked from all sides on the debate stage 02:42

Warren's months-long march to the front of the polls finally put her in the position of being the most heavily targeted and scrutinized candidate on stage.

Buttigieg and Klobuchar led the charge, assailing Warren over her answers on health care.

Warren supports Sanders' proposal for ""Medicare for All"" -- replacing private insurance with everyone receiving coverage through a government-run plan. And while Sanders has acknowledged that Americans' taxes would need to increase to pay for the plan, Warren refused to say whether the middle class's taxes would go up -- instead only saying that, because deductibles, premiums and co-pays would be eliminated, overall costs would decrease.

Buttigieg accused her of dodging a yes-or-no question. ""Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in,"" he said.

Klobuchar accused Warren of being dishonest. ""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice,"" she said.

Warren later addressed the question of taxes, when former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke asked her -- during a discussion about Warren's proposed wealth tax and child care coverage -- whether she would raise middle-class taxes. ""No,"" she said -- but the moment was mostly lost amid cross-talk.

Bernie Sanders won the night

And it had nothing to do with what happened on stage.

In the debate's final moments, the Washington Post broke the news that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans to endorse Sanders. CNN then reported that two other members of the ""Squad,"" Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, will do the same.

The pick-ups are huge. Some Democratic strategists think that outside of the Obamas, Ocasio-Cortez represents the most influential potential endorsement of the 2020 primary race.

It also comes at a key moment for Sanders. Warren's months-long ascent, fueled in part by progressives as she advocated some similar policies to Sanders, was on display Tuesday night, when the rest of the field treated her as the front-runner. If Ocasio-Cortez had supported her, it could have been the beginning of the end of Sanders' chances.

Instead, he gets a major injection of energy -- and sends the signal that he's far from done yet.

Echoes of 2016 as the front-runners fight

JUST WATCHED Warren takes a jab at Biden while complimenting Obama Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren takes a jab at Biden while complimenting Obama 01:41

For most of the night, as Warren wore the biggest target, Biden slipped into the background. That changed near the end of the debate, when the field's top tier -- Biden, Warren and Sanders -- finally unloaded on each other.

The question that loomed over their: Biden has a lengthy record -- but is it one that's in line with where the Democratic electorate is now?

It began when Biden touted his record in former President Barack Obama's administration, pressuring Republicans to vote for measures such as the federal stimulus package.

""We all have good ideas. The question is who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done?"" Biden said. ""And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that's what we should look at.""

That's when Sanders pounced, attacking Biden -- in a moment that felt similar to the Vermont senator's 2016 debates with Hillary Clinton -- over legislation Biden had supported and Sanders opposed over the last three decades.

""Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what, you also got done, and I say this as a good friend,"" Sanders said. ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and (trade relations) with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.""

Then Warren jumped in.

Responding to Biden's assertion that he is best able to get things done, she pointed to her role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration.

Seemingly miffed to be denied a share of the credit, Biden interjected, nearly shouting, ""I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.""

Warren responded by thanking Obama -- but notably omitting Biden.

""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" she said.

Trouble for Biden?

For the former vice president, fading into the background of a debate is a troubling sign because of what it suggests: that his foes view him as less of a threat than they once did.

But just as the good news had come late for Sanders, the real bad news for Biden's campaign came even later Wednesday night.

In a scheduling oddity, reports covering the third quarter of 2019 were due in to the Federal Election Commission by midnight -- an hour after the debate ended.

Biden's report revealed that his campaign ended September with just $9 million on hand. That's far short of Sanders' $33.7 million, Warren's $25.7 million and Buttigieg's $23.4 million -- and is even below California Sen. Kamala Harris' $10.5 million.

A more aggressive Buttigieg

JUST WATCHED Buttigieg to O'Rourke: I don't need lessons from you Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Buttigieg to O'Rourke: I don't need lessons from you 03:29

The South Bend, Indiana, mayor had made it obvious he planned to come out swinging. In the days before the debate, he'd launched an ad that was critical of Warren and Sanders over Medicare for All, criticized Warren's grassroots fundraising strategy for the general election as being reliant on ""pocket change,"" and attacked O'Rourke over his support for mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles in an interview on Snapchat's ""Good Luck America.""

The exchanges with Warren over health care might be the night's most memorable.

But he also got a chance to tout an element of his own biography -- his military service -- in clashing with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the only other military veteran in the field, over her call to end ""endless wars.""

""The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,"" he said.

Buttigieg also sharply criticized O'Rourke -- at one point, in personal terms -- over the former Texas congressman's proposed mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles.

""You just made it clear that you don't know how this is going to take weapons off the street,"" he said. ""If you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate. But we can't wait.""

O'Rourke responded that mass shootings are a ""crisis"" and that Democrats should make the case for farther-reaching gun control measures. ""Let's decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and let's bring this country together in order to do that,"" he said.

Buttigieg shot back: ""The problem isn't the polls, the problem is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.""

""I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy,"" O'Rourke replied. But to survivors of gun violence, and March For Our Lives, the gun control advocacy group founded by students after the Parkland, Florida, shooting last year, ""that was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups,"" he said.

Klobuchar, unleashed

With the Democratic National Committee raising its fundraising and polling thresholds for the November debate, Klobuchar walked on stage facing the real possibility that this debate could be her last.

Her response: Go hard at the Democratic primary's most ascendant candidate, Warren.

""The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,"" she said of Warren at one point, as she criticized her support for Medicare for All.

Klobuchar's performance on Tuesday stands in stark contrast to her first three debate performances, which were more muted.

And there is a reason for that: After qualifying for the first four debates, Klobuchar is on the verge of not qualifying for the fifth Democratic debate in November. While Klobuchar has the required number of donors, she has yet to reach the polling threshold, something that her team believes she can boost with a well-reviewed debate.

Then there's the portion of her approach that's in the eye of the beholder: One of her trademarks as a candidate -- goofy humor -- continued on Tuesday night.

""Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election,"" Klobuchar said. ""This wasn't meddling. That's what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she's doing.""

Yang's 'Freedom Dividend' gets an airing

Andrew Yang launched his presidential campaign in 2017 with a plan to give every American $1,000 a month to combat job losses and automation -- and very little attention from media and voters.

Almost two years later, Yang's plan for a universal basic income, which he's calling a ""freedom dividend,"" remains his signature policy proposal. But his impact on the race has increased dramatically -- a reality that was on display on Tuesday night when the candidates on stage debated a universal basic income and job losses to automation in depth on national television.

""We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, it recognizes the work in our families and communities. It helps all Americans transition,"" Yang said. ""When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle up economy from our people, our families and our communities up. It will enable us to do the work that we want to do. This is the sort of vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace.""

Yang has talked about his universal basic income at previous debates. What made Tuesday different was that other candidates -- some of whom largely ignored Yang in previous debates -- began to seriously debate automation and a basic income.

""I believe that we need to address a community being impacted by automation,"" said former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro.

""I agree with my friend Andrew Yang. Universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so people can make choices that they want to see,"" Gabbard said.

But what clearly cemented Yang's rise is that the debate over universal basic income got him into a direct argument with Warren, who said the issue is broader.

After the debate, Yang told CNN that Warren -- who, with Biden, is at the top of the Democratic field -- had asked him to send her details on his proposal. ""She said she wanted to see the data,"" he said."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed to end school vouchers in her public education plan released Monday despite praising them in the past for helping “take the pressure off parents” and encouraging competition.

Warren released her extensive plan on the public education system in America on Monday, which offered a swath of pledges, from protecting illegal immigrant families to promising an additional $450 billion in Title I funding over the next decade.

One of the most significant aspects of the presidential hopeful’s proposal, however, is her call to end school vouchers. Warren argues that the voucher system leaves minority students behind and called to end federal funding for new charter schools.

Vouchers (or school choice), Warren asserts, hurt minorities and result in school segregation and discrimination. She harkened to her housing plan, which gives states funds to build desirable parks and schools “if they eliminate the kinds of restrictive zoning laws that can further racial segregation”

“And it includes a historic new down payment assistance program that promotes integration by giving residents of formerly redlined areas help to buy a home in any community they choose,” Warren says.

However, Warren’s pitch stands in stark contrast to the solution she offered in years past. During an interview with Fox Business in May 2011, Warren praised vouchers, essentially arguing that they helped solve the problem that she explicitly outlined in the plan released Monday.

She said that school vouchers alleviated pressure from parents and essentially fostered an environment of competition “that really produces results and parents can buy into and believe in.”

Warren said (emphasis added):

The point is, we have a private school system now, only the way it’s doled out is instead of paying tuition, you buy a house in a certain zip code and pay taxes and keep everyone locked out who’s not in that zip code. We call those public schools. But look at the financing for them. If every child in the state of Massachusetts — every child in this country — got a ticket, and the ticket was funded by taxpayers, because I believe in public education, but it could be used at any school regardless of what kind of house parents can afford to buy, it would first take the pressure off parents in terms of having to buy those houses, and second would mean that those schools now compete with each other for offering the kind of education that really produces results and parents can buy into and believe in.

Warren previewed that position years before in her 2003 book, The Two-Income Trap.

“But the public-versus-private competition misses the central point. The problem is not vouchers; the problem is parental choice,” Warren wrote — a line that stands in stark contrast to her current plan to take away parental choice by ending vouchers.

“Under current voucher schemes, children who do not use the vouchers are still assigned to public schools based on their zip codes. This means that in the overwhelming majority of cases, a bureaucrat picks the child’s school, not a parent,” she continued, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal.

Warren carried that position into her 2012 senatorial campaign, even publicly supporting charter schools.

“Warren holds some positions on education that challenge union orthodoxy. For instance, she favors charter schools and the use of student test scores as a factor in evaluating teachers, as long as teachers help craft the evaluations,” the Boston Globe reported in March 2012.

The presidential hopeful’s plan on Monday, though, laments the existence of vouchers and charter schools.

“We have a responsibility to provide great neighborhood schools for every student. We should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits – which are vouchers by another name,” she wrote, adding that we must “fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation’s schools.”"

“Too many immigrants have died in ICE custody,” Warren said. “We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system.”

Warren’s statement came in response to a report that a Cameroon national detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had died while in custody. Unmentioned, though, is that migrant deaths under the Trump administration are 20 percent lower than the rate of migrant deaths under former President Obama.

The promise is just the latest remark where Warren has promoted the donor-class platform of hemispheric open borders between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, as well as Central and South America. The same position has been accepted by the billionaire Koch brothers donor network, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and the big business lobby.

On Sunday, Warren told American union workers that increasing foreign competition against them in the labor market by giving amnesty to the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. would be “good” for them.

“[Amnesty for all illegal aliens] is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions,” Warren said.

High levels of immigration, illegal and legal, put downward pressure on U.S. wages while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth away from America’s working and middle class and towards employers and new arrivals, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has found.

Research by analyst Steven Camarotta has found that every one percent increase in the immigrant portion of American workers’ occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.

While Warren seeks to increase foreign competition against American workers, President Trump has pursued policy initiatives to decrease foreign competition, increasing U.S. wages and giving American workers leverage over businesses.

""I have a lot of respect for Senator Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken than about how this plan is going to be funded.

Buttigieg was among several Democratic presidential candidates who took aim at Warren during the fourth Democratic primary debate hosted CNN and The New York Times on Tuesday night. He has criticized Warren over her support for Medicare for All and criticized her again during the debate for not directly answering a ""yes-or-no"" question on how she would fund such a proposal.

Warren supports Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposed plan, which would create a national government-run health care program and eliminate the private insurance industry -- something several candidates criticized during the debate.

Buttigieg, who has fashioned himself as a centrist candidate as the Democratic Party has veered leftward, was among the Democrats onstage Tuesday night who challenged Warren, who has emerged as a front-runner in the 2020 field. The Massachusetts senator was constantly on defense throughout the debate, underscoring a marked shift in the Democratic race that has been underway for many weeks: while former Vice President Joe Biden has remained strong in the polls, the other candidates in the race clearly now see Warren as the real competition.

Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday released a new plan outlining how she would use the revenue generated by her proposed tax on ""excessive lobbying"" to beef up federal agencies charged with regulating major industries.

""This tax will reduce the incentive for excessive lobbying, and raise money that we can use to fight back against this kind of onslaught when it occurs,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post explaining the strategy.

First unveiled in broad strokes last month , Warren's plan would impose a 35% tax on lobbying expenditures between $500,000 and $1 million. The cost would escalate from there, with a 60% rate placed on every dollar beyond $1 million that rises to 75% once a company's lobbying costs surpass $5 million.

The proposal represents the newest piece of Warren's broad anti-corruption platform, which she has made central to her candidacy. It is the subject matter that Warren is most fluent in discussing and passionate about on the trail, where she often jokes that the ""good news"" is she has ""the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate,"" before waiting a beat and adding: ""Here's the bad news, we need the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate.""

In this chapter of her wider agenda, Warren stresses that the issue goes beyond Congress, lawmakers and the ""revolving door"" between Capitol Hill and K Street -- and addresses lobbyist influence on regulatory bodies.

She was open, when asked, about her affection and appreciation for both Democratic candidates. A decision, if it was going to come at all, wasn't expected until later this year.

""To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,"" the former vice president said of the current White House occupant, adding: ""He's shooting holes in the Constitution. And we cannot let him get away with it.""

Biden had previously indicated that he favored considering impeachment for Trump only if the administration refused to turn over documents to Congress related to the ongoing Ukraine investigation. On Tuesday night, the White House made clear they would not cooperate in any way with the House impeachment probe.

On its face then, Biden's hand was forced by the White House's decision not to cooperate at all. And that undoubtedly was a factor! But so likely did this fact: In four of the last five national polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a larger share of the national primary vote than Biden. And for the first time in this race, Warren's polling average is now above Biden's -- albeit by .2 percentage points.

What those numbers mean is that Biden is really starting to feel the heat from Warren. While she has been rising in polls for months now, it's become clear of late that she isn't slowing down much, even as she approaches and passes Biden, who has been the race's frontrunner since the day he announced his candidacy."

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren comes in at 22%. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders stands at 17%. No one else polls better than 5%.

An average of polls taken since the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump began have Biden at 29%, Warren at 25%, Sanders at 15% and no one else above 5%.

What's the point: Right now, there's little doubt that Biden and Warren are the top tier in the Democratic primary fight. With the exception of Sanders, no one is even close to Biden and Warren nationally. The question now is how likely are we to be looking at the potential nominee when focusing on the top three at this point.

A look back at history suggests there is a high likelihood that either Biden, Sanders or Warren will be the Democratic nominee.

There have been 16 primaries in the modern era in which an incumbent was not running in said primary. For those 16, I looked at the polling averages for each candidate who ultimately ran or was running in the second half of the year before the primary. These averages were calculated by FiveThirtyEight

There have been a number of candidates not close to leading in the polls at this point who went on to win the nomination. A trailing candidate has gone on to win 7 of 16 times (44%). You may recall Barack Obama was trailing Hillary Clinton at this point in the 2008 Democratic primary. Of course, Obama was running second to Clinton.

When you look outside the top three polling candidates in past primaries, there really hasn't been a lot of success. Only three times has a candidate not in the top three at this point won a nomination. Those were George McGovern in 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and John Kerry in 2004.

Another way to look at this is to look at the percentage everyone was polling at. When the leader in the national polls in the second half of the year before the primary was at greater than 20% (12 times), there has been just one instance of someone polling below 15% going on to win the nomination: McGovern in 1972. And even he was polling at 6%, which is greater than all the Democrats outside of the top three at this point in the 2020 cycle.

We can formalize this analysis through a simple model looking at where candidates were polling and whether they won the nomination. When one candidate is polling at about 30% and another is polling at about 25% in contests with no incumbent running, together they have about 75% chance of winning the nomination. Add in a candidate polling at about 15%, the chance that one of the top three wins is about 85%.

Indeed, the average of our three statistical exercises suggest there's about an 85% chance Biden, Warren or Sanders wins the nomination.

This means that the national polls indicate the chance that someone not named Biden, Sanders or Warren wins the nomination is about 15%.

Now, 15% isn't nothing. It leaves open the possibility that one of the candidates at 5% or below may end up strongly challenging for the nomination. The fact that there are so many of them this year perhaps heightens the chance of a non-top three polling candidate wins this year. Perhaps, it will be someone like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is polling very close to the top three in Iowa

Still, the most likely outcome is that the Democratic nominee will be Biden, Sanders or Warren, with Biden and Warren having particularly strong chances."

W. Norton. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) If there's one thing that seems to scare Mark Zuckerberg to the bone, it's the threat of a functional government that represents the interests of its citizens. To him, government appears to be the faceless bureaucracy that slaps him on the wrist with a $5 billion fine when his company spies too much or too illegally on his users.

So when one of his employees asked him at an open meeting what he thought of Elizabeth Warren, Zuck was uncharacteristically candid -- as if triggered by the mere thought of the possibility that someone with so much faith in the power of big government could become our chief executive. She ""thinks the right answer is to break up the companies,"" he said . And even though he believes he would win a legal battle against the US government, he added, ""Does that still suck for us? Yes.""

Considering the company's actions over the past couple of years, this is a battle Zuckerberg has been anticipating and preparing for. Ever since the suggestion of breaking up Facebook was raised at the infamous congressional hearings Zuckerberg underwent in April 2018, he has been effectively circling the wagons.

Facebook's greatest vulnerability is the fact that it's not just one company, but a collection of different platforms and technologies they've purchased over the years. Breaking them up is as simple as, well, separating out these acquisitions. That's why his first move after Congress began asking questions was to integrate his various messaging platforms -- Instagram, WhatsApp -- into the Facebook platform. He argued that this was to offer greater interoperability and convenience. The real reason for such integration was to pre-empt any efforts to split up the company along its obvious fault lines.

Shortly after, Facebook announced it was going to launch a new cryptocurrency, already branded with a freedom-from-tyranny inspiring name, the ""Libra."" It has been widely assumed that Facebook's 2.4-billion user base would give the currency an instant edge over bitcoin and everybody else, perhaps even becoming a default global currency.

So, the new question becomes, will Zuckerberg peg the Libra on the dollar, supporting the United States' role as the world's most central banker? Or will the company base the Libra's value on a commodity, a basket of currencies, or something else entirely? The mere suggestion of such plans gives Facebook leverage over the government that might undertake to control it.

Would Zuckerberg really think and act this way? Of course he would. After all, as he told his gathering of employees, he's the one who sees this as a life-or-death battle: ""At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.""

That's actually a scary thought to me. Facebook screwed up our 2016 elections -- and, arguably, civil society -- by serving as the unintentional conduit for divisive propaganda from near and far.

In a 2018 blog post , Facebook detailed how it planned to better prepare for future elections, which included identifying and removing fake accounts. So Facebook will begin using its employees' and AI's ""judgment"" to determine what sorts of messaging is appropriate for us.

Imagine how much influence the platform could have if its founder really perceived one of the candidates as an existential threat. Do we want to see what an election looks like where Facebook is actively involved, fighting for its life?

What Zuckerberg doesn't get is that Elizabeth Warren isn't simply protecting America from Facebook, but Facebook from itself. While government is responsible for making sure companies don't compete in unfair ways or infringe on people's basic civil liberties, it is also responsible for providing businesses with safe monetary and legal systems through which to operate.

As Warren tweeted , ""What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.""

Breaking up Facebook is far from the worst thing that could happen to the company. That would likely play out like the brooms in the Sorcerer's Apprentice, where each piece of the company animates and grows into its own threat to privacy and democracy. Instead of being bitten by a single great white shark, we get consumed by a thousand piranhas.

No, the real nightmare for Zuckerberg is not being broken up, but being regulated. And the more Facebook integrates its various pieces into one big platform, the easier it will be to monitor, legislate and penalize.

Regulation may be less dramatic than a breakup, but it's also more effective and ongoing. A living and perpetual responsibility. Facebook could grow so big and ubiquitous, it might even become a utility -- publicly owned and operated.

With her penchant for big government and detailed plans, Elizabeth Warren may be the only candidate willing to finally parent and discipline petulant CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, who too easily mistake corporate power for personal liberty."

Elizabeth Warren seeks to put the social media giant on the defensive — by telling a lie.

The ads, which began running widely on Thursday, start with a bold but obvious falsehood: That Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg have endorsed President Trump's reelection campaign.

""You're probably shocked,"" reads the ad, which has already reached tens of thousands of viewers nationwide. ""And you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not.""

The ad's own admission of a lie seeks to draw attention to a controversial Facebook policy Warren has spent days criticizing. Under the policy, Facebook exempts ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking — a loophole, Warren says, that allows Zuckerberg to continue taking ""gobs of money"" from Trump's campaign despite Trump's ads telling untruths about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.

On Saturday, Warren explained her ad was meant ""to see just how far"" the policy goes.

""We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook's ad platform to see if it'd be approved,"" she tweeted. ""It got approved quickly.""

Facebook's willingness to run the ad, she said, shows how the company prioritizes profits over protecting democracy.

Warren's escalating criticism of Zuckerberg highlights the backlash Facebook has faced as it has defended its policy on political advertising. Sen. Amy Klobuchar , another Democratic candidate, tweeted on Thursday that online platforms like Facebook need a ""truth standard for paid ads."" And Biden's campaign has compared Trump's ads to Russian-backed disinformation.

""Whether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said on Tuesday.

In a statement Friday responding to Warren's ad, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said the company believes political speech should be protected.

""If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,"" Stone said.

Facebook's policy on truthfulness in political ads has been in place for over a year, according to Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications. In a recent speech, Clegg said Facebook demotes third-party content shared by politicians on its platform if it has been previously debunked by fact-checkers and rejects its inclusion in advertisements. That could include links, photos or videos created by others. But it does not cover misleading ads or other content created under politicians' own names.

The Warren ad puts Facebook in a challenging position, said Dave Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.

""Either Facebook doesn't touch the ad and the ad is therefore noteworthy, or they touch the ad and it's noteworthy,"" he said. ""It's a smart tactical move.""

Warren has become one of Facebook's key antagonists after first calling for it and other Silicon Valley giants — such as Amazon, Google and Apple — to be broken up. But her rift with Facebook deepened after leaked audio published by The Verge revealed Zuckerberg fretting about the potential consequences of a Warren presidency.

""If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,"" Zuckerberg is heard saying at a companywide meeting. ""And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.""

Warren responded via Twitter, ""What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.

And earlier this week, she said Facebook ""already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people.""

Other analysts say Facebook has made the right decision not to involve itself in regulating political speech. Lee Goodman, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Elections Commission, told CNBC Thursday that he believed Facebook's policy is ""fair"" because it ""doesn't want to be the arbiter and doesn't want to take sides in these political debates.""

Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah who has studied the impact of tech platforms on political speech, agreed that Facebook's policy provides greater transparency about its role in political discourse.

But she added that Facebook's efforts to remain neutral — particularly now, with respect to Warren — could itself affect the course of the 2020 campaign.

""The limits of what our political discourse is these days is, of course, largely shaped by these platforms where a lot of these politics happen,"" she said."
506,"Matt Egan, CNN Business","It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We'd be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast.""
Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group",Elizabeth Warren doesn't just pose a threat to Wall Street. Her rising 2020 polling numbers are also striking fear in the heart of Big Oil.,2019-10-17,CNN,How Elizabeth Warren could 'vaporize' America's oil boom,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/business/elizabeth-warren-oil-fracking-ban/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Elizabeth Warren doesn't just pose a threat to Wall Street. Her rising 2020 polling numbers are also striking fear in the heart of Big Oil.

Warren, currently the odds-on favorite to be the Democratic presidential nominee, wants to ban fracking ""everywhere."" And the Massachusetts senator pledged to immediately sign an executive order to stop all new offshore drilling leases. Both steps go further than her main rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.

It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We'd be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast.""

Warren's aggressive plan for fighting the climate crisis could have profound consequences for the oil and gas industry. Although an outright fracking ban seems unlikely to get through Congress and the courts, such a move would halt America's historic shale oil boom in its tracks, drive up gasoline prices, threaten good-paying jobs and make the nation more dependent on foreign oil.

""It would vaporize the oil and gas boom in the United States,"" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, a consulting firm that advises energy companies and investors. ""There is palpable concern in the oil and gas industry.""

Wall Street analysts are already warning shareholders about the potential hit to the share prices of oil companies, which remain widely held in portfolios despite the climate crisis.

Pioneer Natural Resources PXD ExxonMobil XOM Chevron CVX ""We think the greatest risk to energy companies would occur if Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren wins,"" RBC Capital Markets wrote in a report published on Monday. The firm said it would be ""very bearish"" for a wide range of oil companies, including drillers such as, oilfield service firms and even integrated companies likeand

Warren's campaign declined to comment. But the candidate has defended her aggressive stance by arguing the world doesn't have the luxury of playing it safe.

""Taking bold action to confront the climate crisis is as important — and as urgent — as anything else the next president will face. We cannot wait,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post last month.

The best-case scenario for the oil industry could be the reelection of President Donald Trump, a climate skeptic who has actively supported the fossil fuel industry by slashing environmental regulations and promoting energy exports.

Democrats have taken a much more skeptical approach towards Big Oil than Trump as they pledge to tackle climate change. The leading candidates have called for ending fossil fuel subsidies

Besides Warren, Democratic presidential nominees Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have also pushed to ban fracking , the controversial drilling technique that involves shooting water, sand and other compounds underground to release trapped oil and gas. Fracking has sparked concerns of contaminated drinking water, methane emissions and even earthquakes.

That's why environmental groups strongly support a fracking ban.

""A clean energy economy built to tackle the climate crisis cannot include fracked gas, which is a bridge to climate disaster,"" Ariel Hayes, national political director at the Sierra Club, said in a statement to CNN Business.

'Wildly bullish' for oil prices

Fracking, which gained popularity in the early 2000s, has made the United States the world's leading producer of natural gas and, more recently, the top oil producer . In 2016, fracking accounted for more than two-thirds of all oil and natural gas wells drilled in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration

Driven by the shale revolution, US oil production has more than doubled over the past decade to about 12 million barrels per day. That surge of oil has cushioned the blow from recent events, including oil barrels sidelined by the attack on Saudi Aramco and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

An outright fracking ban would probably send crude oil prices soaring because the United States produces more oil than any other country on the planet. The world is relying on US oil shale oil as the main source of growth for the next several years.

""It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We'd be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast,"" said McNally, a former energy official under President George W. Bush.

Oil jobs at risk

But it wouldn't be bullish for the oil industry. That's because the fracking ban would probably cause highly leveraged US shale oil producers to go bankrupt, or at least have limited financial firepower to take advantage of high prices.

""They will have been regulated out of business,"" McNally said. ""And the US oil companies that remain will get blamed for high oil prices.""

A fracking ban could wipe out countless good-paying jobs in the oil and gas industry.

""You'd have layoffs, everything from the field hands up to the C-Suite,"" said Jeff Bush, president of oil and gas recruiting firm CSI Recruiting.

A 2017 study paid for by the American Petroleum Institute found that a fracking ban would cause the loss of nearly 6 million jobs and lift household energy spending by $4,500 a year.

Warren has pledged to create new jobs to help workers who are hurt by the transition to a greener economy.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has pledged to immediately put a stop to new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands.

""We will no longer force workers to make the impossible choice between fossil fuel industry jobs with superior wages and benefits and green economy jobs that pay far less,"" Warren wrote in the Medium post.

A fracking ban might not have a large impact on prices if oil demand weakened because of a rapid shift towards electric vehicles

However, most forecasters expect the world's appetite for oil will rise for many years, if not decades. And even Warren's own energy plan doesn't call for 100% zero emissions for new vehicles until 2030.

That means diminished domestic oil production would likely make America more dependent on foreign crude, undoing its strides toward energy independence.

""It's not going to reduce consumption,"" said Bush. ""It just means we'd be buying more oil from overseas. I don't think anybody wants that.""

An outright fracking ban also would require an act of Congress, according to analysts.

Such legislation would be unlikely to get through Congress because Republicans are widely expected to maintain control of the Senate. Even if the Senate flipped, moderate Democrats in oil-producing states such as Colorado and New Mexico would face pressure to oppose such a ban.

""There is no real clean path towards a fracking ban,"" said Josh Price, senior analyst at Height Capital Markets. ""It seems completely unrealistic, close to impossible.""

Federal drilling ban could slow oil boom

Still, Warren could take regulatory and executive actions aimed at discouraging fracking.

For instance, RBC said Warren would probably be able to ban fracking and all output on federal lands. Oil output on federal lands is about 2.7 million barrels per day, or 22% of total output.

If such a ban took effect in early 2021, it would slash US oil production by about 300,000 barrels per day that year, RBC said. And by 2025, the firm's US oil production forecast would decline by 1.2 million barrels per day.

The loss of US barrels would drive global oil prices $5 to $10 higher, lifting gasoline prices by 10 cents to 25 cents a gallon, according to RBC. And federal oil and gas revenue would tumble by up to $20 billion.

In sum, even though energy investors might respond negatively to a Warren victory, her proposed crackdown on Big Oil would face enormous challenges, from court fights and economic pressure to a potential political backlash.

""The market could overreact,"" RBC analysts wrote, ""which may provide fundamental buying opportunities.""

In other words, Warren's bark may be tougher than her bite, at least when it comes to oil."

His press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, later tweeted , ""I hope we see honest reporting from today's mtg.""

We can honestly tell you that Trump's remarks were highly dishonest.

We're still looking into some of the President's claims. We can report that at least 20 of them were false:

Barack Obama and Kim Jong Un

""But in the meantime, North Korea, I like Kim, he likes me. We get along. I respect him, he respects me. 'You could end up in a war.' President Obama told me that. He said, 'The biggest problem, I don't know how to solve it.' He told me he doesn't know how to solve it. I said, 'Did you ever call him?' 'No.' Actually, he tried 11 times. But the man on the other side, the gentleman on the other side, did not take his call. OK? Lack of respect. But he takes my call,'"" Trump said.

Facts First: There is no apparent basis for the claim that Obama tried to call Kim Jong Un 11 times.

""This is a total fabrication. Trump is completely delusional, and it's scary,"" Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, said on Twitter in response to our tweet of Trump's quote.

""We never called Kim,"" Ben Rhodes, who served as Obama's deputy national security adviser, told CNN.

Trump has previously claimed that Obama begged Kim for a meeting, another assertion for which there is no evidence.

The Iraq War

""If you remember, I didn't want to go into Iraq. I was a civilian, so I had no power over it. But I always was speaking against going into Iraq,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, ""Are you for invading Iraq?"" He : Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, ""Are you for invading Iraq?"" He responded : ""Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly."" The day after the invasion in March 2003, he said , ""It looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint."" Trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a Fox News interview in January 2003, saying, ""Either you attack or don't attack.""

Trump started publicly questioning the war later in 2003, and he was an explicit opponent in an Esquire article published 17 months after the invasion. That is not the same as ""I was against going to the war.""

The presidential salary

""But I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I'm surprised, to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Trump does : Trump does donate his salary, but the rest of his claim was inaccurate. He is not the only president to have donated the official salary; both John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover did so. Washington did not.

Although Washington initially declined his salary, he relented after Congress insisted.

The Emoluments Clause

Trump attacked critics who said that holding a G7 summit at one of his resorts would violate the Constitution. He said: ""You people with this phony Emoluments Clause.""

Facts First: There's nothing phony about the Constitution's prohibitions against the President receiving payments from foreign and domestic governments.

The clause on foreign emoluments, found in Article I, Section 9, says that ""no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.""

The clause on domestic emoluments, found in Article II, Section 1, says: ""The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.""

Trump might have been attempting to argue that it is phony to apply the clause to his own activities, but, at very least, his wording left an inaccurate impression.

The deal with Turkey

""People have been trying to make this deal for years,"" Trump said of his ceasefire agreement with Turkey.

Facts First: The President's claim is baseless to the point of being nonsensical. The deal is a narrow agreement specifically tied to the Turkish offensive that followed Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from a Kurdish-held region of northern Syria, not an agreement that resolves long-standing regional disputes. Further, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush never sought to give Turkey anything like the concessionary terms of Trump's deal.

The Ukraine scandal

The whistleblower's account

""The whistleblower gave a false account,"" Trump said. He also said the whistleblower's account was ""totally false.""

Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was largely accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct.

You can read a longer fact check here

The whistleblower's knowledge

""The whistleblower had second- and third-hand information. You remember that, it was a big problem,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Some of the whistleblower's information came from others, but some did not. Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community, : Some of the whistleblower's information came from others, but some did not. Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community, noted that the whistleblower had ""direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct.""

Atkinson also explained that the whistleblower was ""credible"" even about events on which the whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge, such as the call: ""... although the Complainant's Letter acknowledged that the Complainant was not a direct witness to the President's July 25, 2019, telephone call with the Ukrainian President, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that other information obtained during the ICIG's preliminary review supported the Complainant's allegations.""

The call document

Trump said, ""... I released a transcription then by stenographers of the exact conversation I had.""

Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly : The document released by the White House explicitly says , on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of the call.

""A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation,"" the document says.

The whistleblower being 'gone'

""You never hear, what happened to the whistleblower? They're gone, because they've been discredited,"" Trump said.

Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers say they have firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.

""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter.

The whistleblower and Adam Schiff

Trump said, ""So was there actually an informant? Maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be shifty Schiff. In my opinion it's possibly Schiff.""

Facts First: This is nonsensical. Schiff, a Democratic congressman and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not have access to the internal White House information the whistleblower revealed; he could not have told the whistleblower about the contents of Trump's phone call with Zelensky or other information the whistleblower reported. The whistleblower : This is nonsensical. Schiff, a Democratic congressman and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not have access to the internal White House information the whistleblower revealed; he could not have told the whistleblower about the contents of Trump's phone call with Zelensky or other information the whistleblower reported. The whistleblower said information about the call came from ""multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.""

Schiff's comments

Trump said of the comments Schiff made about the Zelensky call at a committee hearing: ""So he made up a lie, and I released -- they never thought that I'd do this -- I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had. And now the game was up.""

Facts First: Schiff made his comments about Trump's call after the President released the rough transcript, not before. The White House issued the document on September 25. Schiff spoke at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on September 26.

The crowd in Dallas

""I had 25,000 people, close, in that arena,"" Trump said of his rally last week in Dallas.

Facts First: The American Airlines Center has a capacity of about 20,000. The El Paso Times : The American Airlines Center has a capacity of about 20,000. The El Paso Times reported a crowd of 18,500.

Trump paused mid-speech to ask the fire marshal to let more people in to fill empty space at floor level.

The crowd outside

Trump claimed that about ""at least"" 20,000 supporters were outside the arena during his Dallas rally.

Facts First: Trump's estimate was way off, though it was lower than the ""close to 30,000"" he had claimed during the speech. ""We didn't have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,"" Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in response to that previous Trump estimate.

Rally crowds

""I haven't had an empty seat at a rally,"" Trump said.

Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including a : There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including a rally earlier this month in Minneapolis, a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.

China's economic performance

A week after correctly saying that this is China's worst year for gross domestic product growth in ""27 years,"" Trump said it is China's worst year in ""57 years"": ""China is doing very poorly. Worst year they've had in 57 years. I wonder why. I wonder why. I'm sure you can't figure it out.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its : China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992 , 27 years ago.

While China's official figures are generally considered unreliable, there is no apparent basis for the ""57 years"" figure. (Trump has made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has repeatedly added additional years for no apparent reason.)

Who is paying the tariffs on China

Trump said the US is ""taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China, and they're eating the tariffs.""

Facts First: Americans make the actual tariff payments, and a : Americans make the actual tariff payments, and a bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs.

The length of the Syria mission

Trump said American troops were initially supposed to be in Syria for a mere ""30 days.""

Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of only 30 days.

""There was never a 30-day timetable on the US presence in Syria,"" said Syria expert Steven Heydemann, a professor of government and director of the Middle East Studies program at Smith College. ""The previous administration, and officials serving in this administration, have never offered a fixed timetable for the US mission. Official statements have emphasized that the presence of US forces would be short, limited in scope, and small. But beyond general comments along those lines, there has been no statement indicating it would end after 30 days.""

The troops being withdrawn from Syria

""We're bringing our troops back home. I got elected on bringing our soldiers back home,"" Trump said.

Facts First: He is not bringing the troops back home, at least not at the moment.

Trump has announced that ""United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq."" He has also announced that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia.

Trump conceded at the Cabinet meeting that the soldiers will be ""sent, initially, to different parts,"" but he claimed that they would ""ultimately"" return to the US.

The size of Miami International Airport

Touting the benefits of his Doral resort, Trump said it is right next to Miami International Airport, ""one of the biggest airports in the world -- some say it's the biggest.""

Facts First: Miami International is certainly not the biggest airport in the world.

The airport was not in the top 20 for passenger traffic in 2018 or 2017 . It ranked 15th in cargo traffic in 2018 and 14th in 2017, with less than half of the tonnage of cargo of top-ranked Hong Kong.

Though world airports authorities do not release rankings of airports' physical size, Miami International is not even close to the largest airport in the United States. Chicago's O'Hare, for example, occupies about 7,200 acres, Miami International 3,230 acres

Special elections in North Carolina

""You saw what happened in North Carolina: We picked up two seats that people didn't think we were going to pick up. That was two weeks ago,"" Trump said.

Facts First: The special elections in North Carolina were : The special elections in North Carolina were six weeks ago , not two weeks ago. While the race in the 9th District was considered competitive, the race in the 3rd District was expected by pollsters and analysts to be won easily by the Republican candidate.

Both seats had previously been held by Republicans, so the party did not pick them up. (Trump might have just been speaking informally.)"

The poll – which surveyed 423 registered New Hampshire voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary from September 25-29, 2019 – showed Warren leading the primary field with 25 percent support and Biden on her heels with 24 percent support. Sanders, however, struggled to keep up, falling to a distant third place with just 11 percent support.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MI) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) saw three percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D) and Tom Steyer (D), who garnered two percent support each. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.8 percent:

New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted the sense of “fluidity” in the race, due to the fact that “65% of Warren supporters, 72% of Biden supporters, 56% of Sanders supporters, and 73% of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Levesque added:

Among voters who are not firm in their choice, Warren is the 2nd choice of 26%, well ahead of Biden with 12%, Buttigieg with 11%, Sanders with 7% and Harris with 7%. This suggests that when the field begins to winnow down, Warren may in the best position to pick up other candidates’ support. However, if this turns into a two-person race, the nomination may ultimately turn on what sort of candidate Democrats want to send against Donald Trump: one that they believe would make the best president, or one that they believe has the best chance of beating him. If the former, Warren has a clear 27% to 19% advantage over Biden on the question of whom respondents think would make the best President. However, Biden is seen as the strongest nominee against Trump by 37% of voters compared to Warren with 26%. As in our April poll, Warren leads Biden among ‘extremely interested’ and ‘very liberal’ voters, at 28% – 24% and 35% – 11% respectively.

The poll spells trouble for Sanders, who has been slipping in New Hampshire, as recent polls indicate.

Reports emerged of a staffer shakeup for the Sanders campaign last month. The Sanders campaign moved presidential campaign operations state director Joe Caiazzo from New Hampshire to Massachusetts and replaced him with Shannon Jackson, who served as a senior adviser during Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid and ran his Senate reelection campaign.

While the Sanders campaign continues to reconfigure and strategize on how to win over New Hampshire as it did in 2016, the campaign reported a monstrous $25.3 million received in the third quarter, signaling that his campaign is in it for the long haul."

In the middle of the interview, Mann got stuck on a question: What was something he could share about his wife that the public didn't already know?

Suddenly, turning her attention towards the kitchen, Warren yelled out: ""Oooh!"" Bailey, the couple's 16-month-old golden retriever, had bounded into the sunroom, making a beeline for the senator and her husband.

""To the rescue! Bailey!"" Mann joked.

""Good boy,"" Warren said.

Hours earlier, Mann and Bailey had opened the side door of their Cambridge home, letting CNN reporters inside for the couple's first joint interview of the campaign. Mann's left hand was in a cast.

As Mann explained it, Bailey had recently been roaming off-leash in the neighborhood. He started playing with another dog, but soon ""the play stopped, and the other dog attacked him."" Mann got between the two dogs, and his hand caught on Bailey's harness, resulting in a broken finger.

Mann, a professor at Harvard Law School, headed over to campus to teach a class before taking himself to the emergency room.

Later, when Warren joined Mann for the joint interview, she wanted to set the record straight: ""Bailey got jumped.""

""Let's be clear. Bailey was jumped by another dog,"" she said. ""And Bruce went to Bailey's rescue.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren's dog Bailey stands with her husband Bruce Mann as Warren addresses the media outside of her home after announcing she formed an exploratory committee for a 2020 Presidential run on December 31, 2018 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Both Warren and Mann have long been dog people. As Warren writes in her autobiography, ""A Fighting Chance,"" when she was teaching at the University of Pennsylvania years ago, a group of students surprised her with a golden retriever puppy on the last day of class.

In the course of their wide-ranging interview, Warren and Mann pointed to Bailey as one of the most important ways in which they have tried to keep a sense of calm this year as the Massachusetts senator has been running for President.

Their previous golden retriever, Otis, ""had gotten Elizabeth through"" her first Senate campaign in 2012, Mann said -- ""just by being this big fluffy golden.""

""Otis was the calm. You can do this. We'll get through this together,"" Warren said. ""I would often brush Otis while I'd be on a phone call.""

Otis died just days before Warren's Senate victory. It was a painful loss for the couple, and for years, they said, they couldn't fathom taking on everything that came with taking care of a dog again as Warren juggled her new job in Washington and Mann continued to teach at the law school.

But last summer, Mann saw an opening. One of their grandchildren was visiting, so he would be home in Cambridge for an extended period of time rather than commuting back and forth to Washington, DC. He seized the moment and brought Bailey home.

Now, as Warren runs for President, whenever she is home in Cambridge, the couple makes time to drive over to Fresh Pond with Bailey. A ""really good day,"" Warren said, is when they can do the loop around the pond twice in one day.

Getting Bailey last year ""probably made no sense at all,"" Warren said, but now, they ""can't imagine life without him.""

""And besides, there's really nothing better than a golden retriever puppy to create the illusion of normalcy,"" Mann said."

Bernie Sanders' massive haul.",2019-10-04,CNN,"Elizabeth Warren raises $24.6 million in third quarter, reinforcing status among 2020 front-runners",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/politics/elizabeth-warren-third-quarter-fundraising/index.html,"(CNN) Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million over the past three months, her campaign said Friday morning, falling just short of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' massive haul.

Warren's momentum in the polls, in which she has emerged as a front-runner alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, has been mirrored by a continued rise in small dollar fundraising. She brought in only $6 million during a disappointing first quarter, then jumped to $19.1 million in the second before a breakout summer that saw her outpace Biden by more than $9 million

Earlier in the week, Sanders announced a $25.3 million third quarter total, which set the pace for the 2020 Democratic field. Warren landed just shy of that number, but is well-positioned now to expand her campaign, which has $25.7 million in cash-on-hand, according to the campaign, as the first round of caucuses and primaries approach.

Campaign manager Roger Lau, in an email to supporters, said more than 500,000 people made more than 940,000 contributions to the campaign during the third quarter. The majority of those donors -- 300,000 -- gave to Warren for the first time during that period, Lau said, for an average contribution of $26. Since she entered the race on New Year's Eve, an estimated 750,000 people have given to Warren's campaign.

Warren's impressive total underscores the power of small dollar donors in the 2020 Democratic contest. Both she and Sanders have forsworn high-dollar fundraisers, but combined, they outraised Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, all of whom have tapped wealthy donors, by $4 million this quarter: $49.9 million to $45.9 million.

Sign up here to receive it every weekday morning.

(CNN) There are two plans afoot to oust President Donald Trump. One, impeachment, has transfixed Washington. But the earth is also moving in the other: the 2020 Democratic race.

The smoke has cleared from last week's CNN/New York Times debate , and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has suddenly emerged as the hot ticket for nomination, shaking up assumptions the race is former Vice President Joe Biden's to lose. But Warren is significantly to the left of much of middle America, and her proposals could spook voters -- even many of those who want Trump gone.

It's not impossible that Warren, who wants massive social and structural change in health care, taxation, education and the economy, could herald a political realignment. After all, Washington is often the last to get the news. No one here predicted how Trump ripped the Republican Party from its corporate, country club, internationalist roots and turned it into a working class, populist, anti-elite, isolationist force. But she's still a risky bet. And Trump is itching to run against what he's branding far left-wing ""socialism.""

(This is not just an American conundrum. It could shape the looming UK election as well, where Labour's Jeremy Corbyn hopes to become the most radical Prime Minister in generations — but could end up handing power back to the unpopular Tories.)

First voting is more than three months away, and Warren's boom has woken up centrists like Biden, small town Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. But sooner or later, Democratic primary voters -- generally far more progressive than the country as a whole -- will face a fundamental question: How far left is too far?

'Fascists, racists and Venus-ians'

Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's far-right League party, reportedly mocked concerns that his weekend rally would attract fascists , joking that it would also bring people from the planet Venus. The event was held with fellow right-wing leaders Silvio Berlusconi and Giorgia Meloni in Rome -- just a few days short of the anniversary of Benito Mussolini's famous ""March on Rome.""

Kiu scias?

Remember covfefe?

In a new linguistic faux pas on Sunday, Trump substituted ""Esperanto,"" the globalist's dream language, for ""Esper,"" the surname of his Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

Was the President the victim of predictive text or a rogue spell checker in his since-deleted tweet? Or -- could he actually not know the name of the man he put in charge of the most lethal military in history? Kiu scias?

'Between MAGA hats and black mamas'

Impeachment forces lawmakers into tough choices; their vote on this most crucial of questions could doom them or pave the way to reelection.

No one is in a dicier spot than Doug Jones, the Democratic senator from fiercely pro-Trump Alabama. He won office on a wave of support from African American voters, among whom the President is deeply unpopular. Now, as CNN's Van Jones put it, the senator will be stuck ""between MAGA hats and black mamas"" when it's time to vote.

'That's not what I said'

What's got into Mick Mulvaney? The acting White House chief of staff has suddenly developed a most un-Trumpian compulsion to blurt out the truth.

In Thursday's train-wreck of a news conference , Mulvaney effectively admitted there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine -- the central allegation of Democrats' impeachment case. ""That's not what I said. That's what people said I said,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday"" before being presented with video evidence of his comment.

When he was asked about Trump's aborted decision to host the G7 summit at one of his Florida resorts, he admitted, ""People think it looks lousy,"" referring to fears of self-dealing. Then he offered this excuse: ""(Trump) still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.""

Of course, as President, Trump is supposed to have walled himself off from his hotel and real estate empire to avoid conflicts of interest. Mulvaney's suggestion of the exact opposite makes this the second time in three days his frankness has people asking how long before he's sacked. CNN reported Sunday that Trump's already having second thoughts.

Mulvaney could be getting it all out into the open, with an aim to minimize and normalize behavior that would once have been thought impeachable. But he may also be about to join an infamous DC club of power brokers remembered for their classic ""Washington gaffes"" -- as defined by former CNNer and New Republic editor Michael Kinsley.

A Washington gaffe, of course, is when a politician messes up and tells the truth.

'If the nesting doll fits...'

That's how Hillary Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill responded when Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard rejected the former secretary of state's claim that she was being groomed for a third-party run by Russia.

Clinton must still be simmering at the role the Russians played in helping Trump win in 2016 (she also accused former Green Party candidate Jill Stein of being a Moscow ""asset."") But her attack could backfire: First, she's elevating Gabbard, who barely registers in most polls. Second, evoking a Kremlin puppet master revives the mistrust seeded by the original Russian operation. It's the meddling scam that just keeps on giving.

Elizabeth Warren committed for the first time on Sunday to putting out a plan detailing how ""Medicare for All"" would be funded, after facing criticism and being pressed on how she would pay for the national health insurance plan without raising taxes on the middle class.

""We need to talk about the cost, and I plan, over the next few weeks, to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of 'Medicare for All' and specifically how we pay for it,"" Warren said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday. She told the crowd gathered that the plan ""is something I've been working for months and months, and it's got just a little more work until it's finished, but I want to bring this out.""

""I think there have been many estimates about what the cost will be, and many different payment streams, and I've been working on how to give the exact details to make that work,"" the Democrat told reporters on Sunday, adding later that she's ""ready to put out a plan soon on exactly what the costs will be, and how to pay for it.""

Warren's campaign said last week it was studying a range of options for paying for Medicare for All, leaving open the possibility that the senator may ultimately diverge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on how to pay for his sweeping health care plan -- which Warren has endorsed. Warren has not outlined her own health care plan , and instead is running on Sanders' single-payer legislation that she first signed on to in 2017.

Warren spoke for more than an hour at the event in Indianola before making the announcement. The campaign hoped she would simply mention her upcoming plan when asked about health care, but Warren was not asked the question at the town hall so she delivered this pre-planned message at the end of the event.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is causing him to rethink his decision to stay out of the presidential race, according to CNBC.

Bloomberg is reportedly mulling the possibility of entering the race – if Biden drops out – “according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private,” CNBC reported.

The former New York City mayor’s reconsideration has been ignited by Warren’s growing support over Biden.

Via CNBC:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

Bloomberg ruled out a presidential bid in March, telling supporters that he was “clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

“While there would be no higher honor than serving as president, my highest obligation as a citizen is to help the country the best way I can, right now. That’s what I’ll do, including the launch of a new effort called Beyond Carbon,” he stated at the time.

Warren has positioned herself as a viable threat to Biden, who held the frontrunner status in the early months of the Democrat primary. The Massachusetts senator has surged in recent weeks, besting Biden in a number of national polls as well as early primary and caucus state polls. A YouGovUS/CBSNews poll released over the weekend showed Warren leading Biden in early states by six points– 31 percent to 25 percent:

Warren surpassed Biden in the Real Clear Politics average last week and currently sits less than two points behind Biden in the current average, with 26 percent to Biden’s 27.8.

Biden’s loss of his previously held frontrunner status has Bloomberg mulling a bid, although a source told CNBC that Bloomberg would not make a move unless Biden dropped out of the race.

“I think it’s something he wants. He has not been shy about that,” a Bloomberg ally told CNBC. “Nothing can happen unless Biden drops out, and that’s not happening anytime soon.”

“He’s like everyone else. They can’t get it out of their system,” another source, described as a banking executive, told CNBC.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” another source added.

The former mayor told the Associated Press this year that – if he ran for president – his campaign would focus on “climate change, education, and public health.”

“Climate change could destroy the whole world and kill everyone on it,” Bloomberg said. “It’s frustrating that a lot of people don’t understand that.”

The gun-control activist joined California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) in September, announcing the Satellites for Climate Action initiative, which is “dedicated to monitoring climate change and the impact of the state’s policies,” as Breitbart News reported."

Patrick Murray, Monmouth University's polling director, acknowledged that their August poll -- which found Warren, Sanders, and Biden in a three-way tie -- was an outlier compared with other polling conducted around the same time. But the new Monmouth poll confirms other recent polling suggesting a far tighter race for the Democratic nomination.

It, along with a late-September Quinnipiac University poll , is the second recent national poll to show Warren and Biden topping the field and within the margin of error of each other, and the third to show Warren in the mid- to upper-20s in support.

While eight in 10 registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters say Donald Trump ought to be re-elected President in 2020, 15% said someone else should be in office.

That's what BJ, who was living in Connecticut in 1971 and working as a bank teller, remembers about her first pregnancy. After she started to show, she had to work at a back desk away from the customers, she writes. Now living in North Carolina, BJ is one of the hundreds of women and men who wrote to us after CNN Opinion invited readers to share their experiences with pregnancy discrimination. When thinking about her own life and those of her three daughters and their pregnancies, she said, ""We have come a long way.""

When it emerged that Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren may have faced job discrimination over a pregnancy, the backlash against the claim was swift. One reason Warren's story of pregnancy discrimination prompted such an outcry from Americans on social media earlier this month and from so many of you in response to our call for stories is that for many American women -- and men -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act feels too much like a historical footnote and little else. The Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to ""prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbrth, or related medical conditions."" Before it was signed into law in 1978, it was perfectly legal to refuse to hire, or to fire, a woman because of pregnancy.

Women who, like BJ, were working parents in the 1960s and 1970s, described what it was like seeking work as a woman of childbearing years before 1978; they recalled having to show prospective employers their birth control pills or disclose the dates of their last period to prove they weren't pregnant or wouldn't try to get pregnant if hired. Other women shared heartbreaking stories with us, ones not consigned to the pre-1978 past. Companies denying benefits after a stillbirth, demanding employees return to work one week after delivery.

For those women, it might come as no surprise to consider that as recently as this year, federal courts have been called upon to adjudicate pregnancy discrimination cases; in 2015, UPS lost a pregnancy discrimination case before the Supreme Court (in a decision that united Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Samuel Alito, two justices with very different judicial worldviews).

As recently as 2007, Melanie K. -- who worked for a staffing company and was a 39-year-old mother herself -- reported a client telling her, ""Don't bring me any women who are going to have kids."" When she asked in disbelief for clarification, her client -- a national company seeking IT professionals-- reiterated: ""Avoid any woman of child-bearing age.""

Several years after Melanie's experience, Becca K., of Cleveland, recalled her boss's words to her when she returned from maternity leave after her second child. She needed to ""dial it back to basics while getting back into the swing of things"" because ""changing diapers for three months isn't the same thing as managing a multimillion-dollar business."" For Laura Astorino of Massachusetts, the comments came from a founding partner at the firm where she worked (and where she was told she couldn't have a raise since she was going on maternity leave): he called employees with children ""breeders.""

For women today, pregnancy discrimination is ""is real, it is harrowing, and it is wrong,"" wrote our op-ed contributor Kara Alaimo

These stories of pregnancy discrimination weren't just about pregnancy -- they were also about miscarriage. They were also about adoption. They were also about supporting a pregnant partner.

I was told by my CEO that I couldn't use any of my sick leave because I wasn't theoretically 'sick'. (I was pregnant with twins and would likely have a Cesarean.) I asked the CEO if a man who has back surgery is considered 'sick'. He backed down. — Linda Avey (@lindaavey) October 9, 2019

Jeff from Provo, Utah -- now a stay-at-home dad and a writer -- was a college student when his wife lost the baby she was carrying. He described being told by one of his professors that he could only take time away from class if he provided his wife's medical documentation.

Angela from Oklahoma, wrote: ""I adopted my daughter at birth and I was basically told I wasn't going to get FMLA [12 unpaid weeks for employees who qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993] for a decision I was making. However, the company policy would have allowed me to take time off if I had a drug problem, etc. Just not to take care of my child, because I CHOSE to have her, because I didn't give birth to her. I also CHOSE to leave that company.""

Your willingness to share your most intimate, painful experiences humbled and honored us. Your responses showed us that for so many Americans -- past and present -- who are working to bring families into the world and support them, there are no easy answers.

""She's taken full advantage""

In 1996, I was a 4th year attorney starting a new job with a well-respected boutique firm in Houston. On my first day, one of the named partners took me to lunch. As we were entering the elevator, a visibily pregnant woman was exiting and the partner introduced her to me as one of their associates. Once on the elevator, he snidely said to me, ""This is Catherine's third child. She's taken full advantage of our maternity leave program."" I've never forgotten that comment or his tone and it definitely was in mind when I had my first, and only, child a few years later while still at the firm. I felt pressured to do a fair amount of work remotely during my 3 months of leave, so as to not damage my chance at partnership, which I eventually got. Catherine never made partner and eventually left, as I did in 2007.

I'm due in January. Things need to change

In 2011, I discovered I was pregnant after starting a new job. I work in a male-dominated field, and my pregnancy seemed to confuse my male bosses. My employer's response was, ""I've been in this industry for 10 years and I've never heard of such a thing!"" I assure you, my reproductive system works the same way as any other woman's. They didn't want to work with me on appointments. They didn't understand why I needed to miss hours for glucose tolerance testing, an amniocentesis, my anatomy scan. They were upset I could no longer lift 50 pounds or more.

I live in a state that isn't really pro-women's rights. I'd been on the job for 6 months when I was placed on modified bed rest for the last 4 weeks of my pregnancy. My company kept my job open. However, when I finally delivered, I was expected to return to work just two weeks later. I had a difficult delivery, and my doctor wouldn't authorize a return to work until 8 weeks postpartum. I didn't qualify for FMLA.

I lost that position. I was a single parent. The loss of income was devastating. I had to put my children on Medicaid to insure them. We went on SNAP for a while. In the end, I spent 18 months as a stay-at-home parent, and I cherish that time. But I'd rather have been employed.

Now, in 2019, seven years later, I find myself in the exact same position. I started a new job and discovered I was pregnant. Nothing has changed. If anything, the current environment is even more hostile to mothers in the workplace. I work for a really good company, so that helps, but I still find myself with no job protection. I still don't qualify for FMLA. My state still has no provision for pregnant women. Health care costs have skyrocketed, and as have the costs of having a baby.

I'm due in January. Things need to change. This country is lacking in women's rights. Many mothers would love to stay home with their new baby for a year [as other countries mandate in terms of paid leave]. We simply can't afford to. At the very least, we need a maternity program that isn't dependent on how long you've been working. Let us collect Social Security during that time. If our employers can't afford to hold our jobs, which is especially hard for smaller companies, let us collect unemployment. Humanity literally depends on women having babies. It's time for this country to realize that.

Men are also punished

When my wife was pregnant with our third child, we had some significant health scares for the baby requiring weekly ultrasounds. I didn't miss more work than I had sick time, but I used my accrued sick leave to help take care of my wife and children when needed. When the opportunity for promotion came up, my supervisor told me that they needed someone more dependable and that because I had taken so much time off to care for my family, I wouldn't be eligible. (I also never took time off for this without finding someone to cover as well.) I am sure that it is worse for the women who are pregnant, but men who actually take time off for pregnancy/paternity leave are also punished.

Discrimination isn't the problem. Entitlement is

Having a child as a working parent is difficult. I know because I have two children. Both were delivered via Caesarian and I was fortunate to have eight weeks with each baby after delivery. Before deciding to have children, consideration was given to the time and effort required to raise a child. It became glaringly apparent that parenting would not come without sacrifice. Never did my employer indicate that pregnancy, nursing or parenting would impact my job. Had they suggested that, I would not have blamed them. I spent 9 months mostly in the office bathroom vomiting (pre-delivery) and a significant amount of time pumping when I returned from maternity leave. Guess what, my male cohorts didn't.

I am not denying that there are ignorant people out there, but I think the prevalent problem facing us is that of entitlement. We want to be successful career women, but don't want to sacrifice having children. We want to have children, but expect to be given advantages, excuses, for sub-par performance. The reality is that life is about choices. I have made mine after careful consideration. Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. This is my experience. Please consider it as valid before dismissing it because it doesn't align with your storyline.

Pregnant? You still have to lift a Labrador retriever

I worked as a veterinary technician and was told that while they understood I could no longer assist with X-rays, I was expected to continue lifting dogs up to 75 lbs by myself and that I would not be allowed extra breaks or time off during my pregnancy. I considered quitting, but felt certain that another veterinary establishment would choose not to hire me if they knew I was pregnant.

What it was like the year the Pregnancy Discrimination Act became law

In 1978, I was a 21-year-old female interviewing for my first management position after college. I remember, distinctly, making it to the final round of interviews with four different corporations in which the hiring manager doing the final interview was always a white male. In three of the four interviews, I was asked when I was planning to get married and have children. My response was I wasn't in a relationship and couldn't see that happening for many years to come. After convincing them my career was my priority, each of these men followed up with a sentiment similar to, ""Of course you understand why we have to ask that question. Training new management recruits and investing in their careers is expensive. If you were to go off and start having babies, you wouldn't be able to give us the same level of commitment."" I was offered a position with all four corporations; I accepted a position with the corporation that never approached that question.

You're forced to choose and live with the consequences

I was a married PhD student. When my dissertation director found out I was expecting my first child, he was furious. ""You can't have a baby AND write a dissertation. It can't be done,"" he said. I did both, but had even more resistance about being a new mom when I defended my dissertation -- this time by the women on my committee. Even though they teach, higher ed is NOT mom-friendly. And this was in 2006!

I had another discriminatory incident when I gave birth to my second child. I was adjunct teaching at the university level and had my course load cut in half when my second child was born. I was told the cut would only last a semester, to accommodate my schedule, but the program director never reassigned the courses next semester. So my salary was permanently cut in half. I knew something like that would happen, and came back to work 3 weeks after giving birth to try to protect my job. Obviously, that didn't work.

This is the reality for women in America's higher education system. You're forced to choose, and live with the consequences. I just don't understand why Warren's comment is even a question. It happens every day.

With a baby in the NICU, I lost my job

I went into the hospital with pregnancy complications at 29 weeks and was [put on] 24-hour bed rest. I delivered my daughter 6 weeks early at 34 weeks. I notified my employer of her birth per being told to a few days later. I was then informed that I only had 2 weeks of leave left and would need to return to work after or be terminated. They ran my short-term disability and FMLA concurrently without telling me so I used up 6 out of the 8 weeks while on bed rest. I asked if I could work from home because I physically couldn't come back in two weeks (C-section delivery). It was up to my supervisor to approve and he denied stating he didn't believe I would truly work. With a new baby in the NICU and fresh from surgery, I was terminated from my job.

I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy

I am Elizabeth Warren's vintage. Interviewing for my first professional job In 1978, I was pregnant but did not disclose it. Part of the hiring process was passing a physical. I actually prayed it would not disclose the pregnancy, knowing I would not get hired. After many months of working to make myself indispensable (and still hiding my pregnancy), I told my manager I would need a maternity leave. Annoyed, he said if he'd known I was pregnant he would not have hired me. Nevertheless, he did not fire me and I returned to work after a six-week leave. Four years later, I again became pregnant. My manager was then a VP and I was then a director. By that time, it was assumed I would take a leave and return to work, which I did. But I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy.

""You better not be pregnant""

I was working at a law firm in 2014 and was called into my boss' office and he inappropriately told me that another attorney had just told him she was pregnant, so his direct quote to me was, ""She is pregnant so you better not be."" He then went on to tell me that only one of us could be pregnant on the team at once and that we all better coordinate that. The truth was I had just found out the day before that I was pregnant and was then completely terrified. I unfortunately suffered a miscarriage with that pregnancy, but knew that I would never be able to have a healthy pregnancy at that office. I had seen them fire a pregnant woman and also fire a woman who came back to work post pregnancy who was then hospitalized for severe postpartum depression. She was fired while still out on leave for her postpartum. I had also been told that my career would be ruined if I got pregnant. Rather than continue my career as a law firm attorney and continue in that environment, I chose to take a corporate job where I remain today, happily the mom of 2.

I've been one of the ""lucky"" ones

I went for an interview at 10 weeks pregnant. I had 2 previous consistent miscarriages, so I didn't feel comfortable disclosing I was pregnant. After I reached 16 weeks, out of joy and need for emotional support, I told my supervisor and the owner of the business I was pregnant. A week later, I was fired because ""I just wouldn't be happy there due to personality conflicts."" It took me 4 months, without unemployment benefits (which means all of our bills, rent and car payments fell way behind and my husband was pulling 12- to 14-hour shifts, 7 days a week, as well as being threatened with eviction every month) to find another place to work. By that time, my pregnant belly was already showing, and I had very limited choices since I would obviously need maternity leave within a few months. I've been one of the lucky ones who found an office full of new and experienced moms and I was hired and still work there now.

Three of my colleagues stood up for me

In 1998, I was the only female doctor in a medical clinic. When I got pregnant with my first child, the director told me I should find another job because managing a primary care practice after having a baby was not going to be possible. Fortunately for me the clinic nurse manager, a woman, and two of my male colleagues stood up for me. I had to make concessions and be in clinic 5 days a week in order to keep my job though. Twelve years later, I became the clinic director. By then the majority of our physicians were women and motherhood was not only accommodated but celebrated.

I am a better person today because I had kids

I became pregnant with my first daughter in 2015. I was working at a rapidly growing tech company in the Midwest, and I was quickly excelling in my career. The company was mostly male but still had some female representation. The problem was that I was the FIRST female to have a baby (while working there). As soon as I told my boss and HR I was pregnant, fear set in with everyone it seemed. How do we handle this? Where will she be able to pump that's private and NOT a bathroom (which is legally required)? I also learned that the company had a paternity leave policy but NO maternity leave. I could take unpaid FMLA but no paid leave -- I couldn't even save up vacation time to use after having the baby.

Once the management team was aware, I was told to announce this to the team. After the announcement, crickets. I was on an island now. No one knew what to do with me or how to work with me. The first question was, ""Are you leaving?"" At first, I said ""No!"" That answer quickly changed. I ended up quitting that job and staying home with my baby and working as a part-time freelancer for about 3 years. It was wonderful. I will never regret that decision. However, I am now managing a growing agency (based on continuous business growth from freelancing) and I will NEVER put one of my team members in that position. I want flexibility and freedom for moms and dads that I work with. I never want to lose talent and potential because someone chooses to have a child. I know I am a better person today than I was before I had kids. I work harder. I work smarter. And I credit a lot of that to being a mom AND a bad ass businesswoman.

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren .

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million workers, is among the largest in the country. Over the last month or so, nearly a dozen candidates have sat down on-camera to make their cases to union voters. Nine hopefuls, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have signed a pledge promising their support on issues Teamsters members recently voted to prioritize ahead of the primary.

""I think the candidates are trying to resonate and talk about what issues are important to working people more than what they did last time (in 2016),"" Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa said in an interview. ""And I think they're doing a good job.""

Hillary Clinton finished nine percentage points ahead of President Donald Trump (51% to 42%) with union households in 2016. Democrats will hope that margin widens come 2020. Warren, Biden and Sanders have all actively sought labor support and appeared on picket lines with striking United Automobile Workers members. Sanders in particular has made labor a focal point of his campaign, and been a fixture alongside workers protesting for higher wages and a union.

To be eligible for the Teamsters' official backing, candidates -- including Trump -- must agree to a three-point pledge assuring their support for labor-friendly trade deals, federal efforts to enhance and protect collective bargaining rights, and legislative action to protect endangered pension funding. Union members can track the process on a new website launched late Thursday. The candidates are also being asked to promise official neutrality should their staffs, as a number have already done, move to unionize.

The Teamsters also announced plans to hold a candidate forum on December 7 in Iowa.

When the union chose Clinton over Trump in 2016, the announcement came in late August. Hoffa didn't specify when a choice would be made this time around, suggesting it might not come until, or after, the Democratic National Convention next summer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The process, which is meant to more deeply engage candidates and rank-and-file union members, will culminate with Hoffa delivering a recommendation -- based in part on a survey of local leaders -- to the general executive board.

Hoffa pointed to the fluid nature of the crowded race, and the increased attention on labor issues, as reasons the Teamsters might take their time in picking a horse. So far, most major unions have been slower to jump behind a single candidate.

""This is changing so fast. You know, who would have imagined that Bernie would have a heart attack, who would imagined the controversy with regard to Biden and his son,"" Hoffa said. ""Those are unknown things. And there's always unknown things that happen in campaigns, especially when you have a long time like this.""

There are, however, already a number of clear divides among the candidates publicly vying for Teamster support. Most notable is their backing -- or opposition -- to ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health care, the signature proposal of Sanders' campaign. A number of labor leaders and some vocal union members have expressed concern over a move to Medicare for All.

Hoffa is among the skeptics.

""The Teamsters have health care for all. And I just think we have to educate (the candidates) on that issue. I can't believe they would say that we're going to give up our insurance,"" he said. ""That's something we would be very, very strong on. That's just not something that we would concede.""

Still, he spoke warmly of his and the union's relationship with all of the leading candidates -- and the efforts of union members to engage them on the trail. According to the union, Teamsters have made more than 100 contacts with candidates over the last three months, asking them 95 questions. Twenty Teamsters locals in 14 states, with a focus on the early-voting hubs, have taken active roles. Midwestern swing states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will also see a burst of door-knocking, phone calls, text messaging and other digital outreach.

""I'm very heartened because I happen to know all these candidates. One way or another, over the years, we got to talk -- when Biden was vice president, Warren in the Senate. Bernie we've known for years and (New Jersey Sen. Cory) Booker we've known forever,"" Hoffa said. ""And all these people come together with a lot of experience and it's a very talented group of people."""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont by name for their support of ""Medicare for All.""

The ad -- titled ""Makes More Sense"" -- highlights Buttigieg's Medicare for All Who Want It health care plan, a middle-of-the-road approach that would not force people onto government health coverage but would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll. That is a key distinction between Buttigieg's plan and the sweeping overhaul that would be instituted under a full Medicare for All program.

The ad represents an escalation by the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's campaign, after he's mostly kept his Medicare for All critiques nameless and primarily focused on policy.

Buttigieg's ad uses reporters and media figures to describe the differences between the plans, including CNN political commentator Joe Lockhart saying, ""Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished.""

His campaign said in a news release, ""The ad highlights Pete's bold approach to health care would not kick millions of people off their private health care, and would give them the option to choose the plan that's right for their them.""

The question during the CNN/New York Times debate that set off the onslaught was a familiar one: Would Warren raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for a single-payer health care program? Warren's response, too, was consistent with what she's said in the past -- but didn't provide a clear answer.

""My view on this and what I have committed to is, costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families,"" Warren said, again stressing that taxes on ""the wealth and big corporations"" would fulfill the bulk of the financing before pledging that she would ""not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.""

But the stage was not satisfied. And with that, a nearly three-hour storm began -- and it was Warren most often standing under the angriest clouds.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who was aggressive throughout the night, called Warren ""evasive"" and, addressing her directly, said: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who repeatedly pivoted to Warren when asked a question, also took direct aim at her Senate colleague's murky explanation.

""We owe it to the American people,"" she said, ""to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders , who has been careful not directly criticize his progressive ally, defended Medicare for All after Buttigieg zeroed in on the policy itself -- but added, as he's stated before, that taxes would go up nearly across the board in order to pay for the plan.

""As somebody who wrote the damn bill, let's be clear: Under the Medicare for All bill I wrote, premiums are gone, copayments are gone, deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone,"" Sanders said, before adding, ""But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up"" mostly for the wealthy, but also for some middle class Americans.

Sanders, as he's done on the trail, argued that the implementation of Medicare for All would, despite those tax hikes, mean that most Americans would be paying significantly less overall. Warren makes the same point, but her consistent demurrals when faced with the tax question -- on the campaign trail, when it's been posed by voters at rallies, and on the debate stage -- set up Medicare for All critics for a predictable pile-on.

But the scrap over health care was only a modest preview of what was coming for Warren, who has topped the field in a number of recent polls of early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Lower-performing rivals like former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Kamala Harris gave the debate a feeling, at times, of being a referendum on Warren.

After the debate, Warren's campaign described the incoming volleys as more evidence of the candidate's growing stature and prospects.

""Elizabeth Warren has built momentum by running a campaign of substance, identifying problems facing the country and laying out her plans for big structural change to fix them,"" communications director Kristen Orthman said. ""She took heat tonight as a result of that momentum, but she stayed focused on what's broken and how she plans to fix it with a government and an economy that works for the people.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden was more tempered than some others in his language, but he also accused Warren of being ""vague"" in her discussion of Medicare for All and, as he livened up as the debate pushed into its third hour, claimed to the be the only one the stage who had accomplished anything ""big.""

Warren answered that suggestion with a sharply confident reminder of her work in crafting and establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people,"" Warren recalled. ""And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try because you will never get it passed.""

Biden jumped in after Warren finished to talk about his role in seeing that it did, telling her: ""I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.""

Warren answered his aggressive claims with a deadpan: ""I am deeply grateful to President Obama,"" she said, ""who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.""

Harris picked a more narrow line of attack, pushing Warren -- who has been critical of Facebook's ad policy, which doesn't vet candidate's claims -- to follow her lead and demand Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account.

""Sen. Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that, on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies,"" Harris said.

Warren responded by implicitly belittling the ambition of Harris' demand: ""I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter,"" she said. ""I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.""

When Harris continued pushing, asking Warren to ""join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down,"" Warren turned her down with a flat ""no.""

In a Democratic primary campaign that has yet to see a candidate rewarded for explicitly attacking a particular rival, the attempts to wallop Warren are as likely to backfire as cut her down.

O'Rourke zeroed in after the wealth tax plans by Warren and Sanders became a point of contention, with businessman Andrew Yang saying the policy ""makes a lot of sense in principle,"" but questioned whether and how it would work in practice.

""Sometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other,"" O'Rourke said, ""instead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together around those solutions.""

""I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive,"" Warren said. ""Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires,"" before reprising an argument that she's been making for years: that the wealthiest Americans owed a financial -- and moral -- debt to the country that helped facilitate their success.

Ultimately, it was Sen. Cory Booker who sought to pull Warren out of the barrel and tsk-tsk his rivals over both the tone and text of their criticisms.

""I have seen this script before. It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020,"" Booker said, warning Democrats against ""tearing each other down because we have different plans."""

(CNN) While the latest head-to-head polls show President Donald Trump trailing Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren , translating those polls into votes for the Democratic nominee next fall won't be easy.

Earlier this month, Elizabeth Warren announced that she would not hold big-dollar fundraisers , even if she becomes the Democratic nominee. Within hours, though, her aides added a caveat: This pledge did not apply to fundraisers she would do on behalf of the Democratic National Committee.

This important addendum should come as no surprise to those who have been following the problems at the DNC for the last several years. With just one year left before election day, the DNC doesn't have the money , the data or the team to adequately support the eventual nominee. Filings from late September reveal an anemic DNC mired in debt while the RNC has senior staff set up already in a whopping 19 states

Elizabeth Warren, and every other candidate who appeared on the debate stage last week, knows that it will be nearly impossible to win the White House without a competent national party apparatus — especially if there is a protracted fight for the nomination that stretches into the spring.

Voter turnout is what will ultimately decide who wins the 2020 election. This election will not be about winning over undecided voters with television ads. There are few undecided voters, now that nearly every American has an opinion about President Trump (only 5% have ""no opinion"" about his job performance). But it doesn't matter whether more than half of voters want him out of the White House if they don't show up to vote when it counts.

That's why money — and enough time to spend it — matters.

Turning out voters takes enormous resources on the ground in every state. It takes money far enough in advance that a campaign can build out a ground game with enough time to identify middle- to low-propensity voters, target them with digital ads that are laser-focused on their interests and bombard them with information to get them to the polls at the right place and on the right day.

It takes field staff knocking on the right doors at the right time so that a candidate banks as many votes as possible when early voting starts. That makes it easier come Election Day, when field staff can focus on targeting the remaining stragglers. It's a game of millimeters.

(This is why Hillary Clinton and her team sound silly when they crow about winning the popular vote in 2016. All that means is they wasted time and money targeting the wrong voters. I assure you that the Trump team didn't waste a moment's thought on getting extra votes in Texas. They spent their resources in, you guessed it, Pennsylvania Wisconsin, and Michigan .)

Let's step back a moment. Last week, The New York Times published an in-depth story about voters in a swing county in Pennsylvania. The interview that opens the piece is with Mark Graham, an Obama voter who switched to supporting Trump in 2016. He hasn't been impressed by the President's performance (he called Trump's behavior ""a joke""), but after watching the Democratic primary debates in September, he told the Times he couldn't back any of the Democrats either.

Then came the political chaos of the past few weeks. Now Graham says, ""I'd vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is at this point."" Upon reading that, the DNC may be gaining confidence -- that's one more vote in Pennsylvania, right?

But do you see the problem? Graham doesn't actually like any of the Democratic candidates on that stage; he just happens to like Trump less. He's what you'd have in your database as a high-propensity voter (he votes every four years) with a low attachment score for the eventual nominee (he's not particularly motivated to vote for the Democrat).

Graham is not undecided -- but once the general election is here and he's bombarded with negative ads about the Democratic nominee on social media, specifically targeted to his interests, Graham may well throw up his hands and decide not to vote at all.

This means the DNC needs someone to visit Mr. Graham and remind him of all the things he's feeling right now about President Trump and make sure he doesn't decide to stay home in November of 2020. He doesn't need to hear more about Medicare for All canceling his private insurance; he needs to hear about President Trump's latest mess.

But who's going to knock on that door? And, unless The New York Times writes a profile on every voter in Erie, how will the DNC know who else to talk to and what to say?

While the Democratic primary candidates are raising gobs of money , they are also spending it largely in ways designed to help them defeat their fellow Democrats in the primaries, not to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.

On the one hand, Democratic contenders are building miniature ground games in early primary states, which would be good, except that Pennsylvania and Ohio are not early primary states. You don't need a ground game in South Carolina to beat Donald Trump come next fall.

Building those early ground games, of course, is exactly why the party committees exist. But the DNC isn't exactly inspiring confidence that the organization will be ready for the fight come 2020.

New FEC reports were filed last night and the gulf continues to widen. The DNC raised under $7 million , with $8.6 million on hand and more than $7 million in debt. The Republican National Committee, on the other hand, raised more than $27 million and has over $59 million on hand with no debt. This means the Trump campaign and the RNC combined in the third quarter to raise over $125 million.

Add that to the multiple staff shakeups at various Democratic party committees and, well, yikes.

Voters have strong feelings about the President and about the direction of the Democratic Party . But feelings don't equal turnout. A recent experiment , for example, showed that Democratic voters who were exposed to news coverage about some of the left-leaning policy positions taken by Democratic candidates at the debate became slightly more enthusiastic about voting for the eventual nominee of their party.

But the survey also showed two big red flags. First, independents who read about the party's leftward turn were 6% less likely to vote Democratic.

Second, the experiment also found that the results ""did not indicate [Democratic voters] were more motivated to vote and campaign for the eventual nominee than those who hadn't read about them.""

This is why campaigns and parties spend hundreds of millions of dollars on targeted digital ads, and on building a robust ground game. And while the President may be turning off non-white voters in Florida , Democrats aren't going to win that state or any other swing state unless their voters actually show up to—you guessed it—vote.

But the eventual Democratic nominee won't have a field army to greet them at the Panhandle gates.

We may spend a lot of time talking about the polls in the media, but the candidates who appeared on last week's debate stage would be wise to remember: Polls don't vote."

Now he's opening up about their 2020 'adventure',https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/politics/elizabeth-warren-bruce-mann-cnntv/index.html,"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) As Elizabeth Warren's candidacy for president caught fire this summer, so did images of her seemingly endless energy: running on to the stage at campaign events; punching the air when she speaks; working the photo line for hours after rallies.

In the evenings, Warren keeps moving, often doing laps around the hotel grounds or pacing in the lobby. But she does it with a different kind of intensity -- this is when she is starting to unwind, talking on the phone with her husband, Bruce Mann.

A professor at Harvard Law School specializing in legal history and property law, Mann is unquestionably the quieter half of the couple. Friends, colleagues and campaign aides say Mann has never been one to seek the public spotlight. But as Warren climbs in the polls, there may be no escaping it.

On a recent Friday morning, Mann and Bailey, the couple's rambunctious 16-month-old golden retriever, answered the side door of their Cambridge home, letting CNN reporters inside for the couple's first joint interview of the campaign. Mann's left hand was in a hard cast -- he had recently broken a bone while trying to break up a fight between Bailey and a neighbor's dog. (""Bailey got jumped, let's be clear,"" Warren would later insist -- she's never known Mann to get caught up in a scuffle. ""Bruce went to Bailey's rescue."")

Asked about the couple's contrasting personalities, Mann, 69, responded with a smile: ""It just works.""

Seated next to her husband of almost 40 years in a white wicker chair in their back sunroom, Warren chimed in in agreement. ""I don't want to be married to somebody like me. I want to be married to somebody like him.""

If Warren is elected, Mann would play an unprecedented role as the first male presidential spouse. That role once seemed likely to go to Bill Clinton , a man thoroughly accustomed to the political stage. Mann would be a very different kind of first husband -- a longtime observer of politics, but far from a politician himself. A little more than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Mann said he has not been closely involved in the ins and outs of the Warren campaign, and remains a mystery to most voters.

But those close to the couple say that Mann's influence on his wife's candidacy is not to be underestimated -- he has a unique ability to help his famously energetic wife decompress after long days of travel and campaigning, they said. ""He brings a sense of calm to her more than anyone else could,"" said Nora Keefe, Warren's bodywoman.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, husband Bruce Mann and dog Bailey.

""When you see the images of Elizabeth up in front of a crowd, waving her hands, just being part of the crowd, I can't quite imagine Bruce up there waving his hands,"" said Drew Faust, the former president of Harvard University who has been friends with the couple for years. ""There's this enormous warmth between them. And he is obviously -- they are both obviously devoted to one another and take pride in their differences.""

Warren noted that much of her life over the last year has been ""different motel rooms every night, hotel rooms every night, different food, different people around, but I always know the last person I'll have a good conversation with, the last person I'll talk to before I go to sleep, is you.""

Of those late-night phone calls, she said: ""It's like letting all the pieces go.""

That morning was looking like it could shape up to be what Warren describes as a ""really good day"": when she is home long enough to fit in two walks around Fresh Pond with Bailey and Mann, once early in the morning and again at night.

""There's really nothing better than a golden retriever puppy to create the illusion of normalcy,"" Mann joked.

""If you don't run and Democrats lose, you'll feel guilty""

In two wide-ranging interviews -- first with Mann and, later, the couple speaking together -- they discussed what has been anything but a normal year.

They couldn't pinpoint one moment when it became clear that Warren would run for president, something she had decided against doing four years ago. In the months leading up to the 2019 New Year, Warren had begun to quietly consult people whose advice she trusted, asking each of them for three reasons she shouldn't run, and three reasons she should.

""She saved me for last, and finally, she asked me for three reasons, pro and con. And I said, no, I'm not going to do it,"" Mann recalled. ""I said, you're gonna run anyways. So just doesn't matter. Because if you don't run and Democrats lose, you'll feel guilty because then that means there'd be no one to fight for the people and the issues that you care about.""

He was right. Warren would announce her exploratory campaign on New Year's Eve.

A registered Democrat and a self-described ""political junkie"" and ""compulsive reader of newspapers,"" Mann said he has been exercising discipline to avoid being consumed by news about his wife's campaign. He is sparing in what he flags to Warren, who has said she doesn't follow the news about the election closely.

US Senator from Massachusetts (D) Elizabeth Warren is flanked her husband Bruce Mann as she is sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence.

Warren has also taken a similar approach to polling, repeatedly declining to engage questions from reporters about who's up and who's down. At one point in the joint interview, when Mann was asked why he believes his wife has been leading in recent polls, Warren leaned into her husband with a reminder: ""And you remember, we don't do polls.""

""That's right, we do not do polls,"" Mann said. But he offered up a theory on what has been attracting voters to his wife this year.

""She's always had just an extraordinary ability to explain complex issues, clearly, memorably,"" he said. ""Watching people who hear her respond to her as she reaches them, as she helps them see how the issues touch their lives -- it's, I'm watching her teach on a larger stage.""

""I just fell for her from 25 yards out""

The couple's first meeting in the summer of 1979 was, as Mann describes, ""improbable."" He and Warren were both 29 and new to teaching, and had traveled to Key Biscayne, Florida, to attend an economics and law conference.

He spotted Warren, who had recently separated from her first husband, Jim Warren, across the lawn at an opening reception. ""Even from that distance, I was just drawn to her,"" he said. ""She was so just lively, so animated, so engaged. And I just fell for her from 25 yards out before even meeting her.""

Admittedly, it wasn't quite love at first sight for Warren.

""That was a Sunday, late afternoon,"" she mused of their first meeting. ""I wasn't completely in love with him until sometime mid-morning on Monday.""

What sealed the deal for Warren: ""It was on Monday when I actually saw him in shorts. And good-looking legs. That's when I was all in.""

""She completely objectified me,"" Mann responded with a grin.

If there was an immediate physical attraction, the pair also bonded over their similar upbringings.

Warren was born in Oklahoma City, the baby of four. As she has told voters on the campaign trail this year, Warren vividly remembers watching her mother walk out of the house one day to look for a job after her father suffered a heart attack. Mann's parents didn't have much money, either. ""They stretched and stretched and mortgaged to the hilt to buy the cheapest house in the town with one of the best public school systems,"" he said.

Within months of their first meeting in Florida, Warren visited Mann at the University of Connecticut, where he was teaching at the time. She sat in on one of his classes, and after all of the students had left, Mann recalled asking her: ""What'd you think?'""

""And she just said, 'What can I say? Will you marry me?' And I said, 'OK.' That is a direct quote, I remember every word.""

The couple juggled living in different cities long after they were married. Warren would continue teaching in Texas, before eventually getting hired at the University of Pennsylvania, where Mann also taught for almost 20 years. But when Warren landed a full-time teaching position at Harvard University in the 1990s, it would be years before Mann would also get a professorship at the school.

They leaned on Warren's aunt, ""Aunt Bee,"" to help raise Warren's two children from her first marriage, Amelia and Alex. In campaign speeches, Warren credits her aunt, after whom she is named, for changing the course of her life. She credits Aunt Bee, who lived with the family for 16 years, for having allowed her to continue teaching.

""Oh, she'd be so proud. She loved Elizabeth dearly,"" Mann said of Aunt Bee, who died in 1999. If she were still alive and observing Warren's 2020 campaign, Mann said, ""Her first response would probably be: 'How can I help?'""

""You just jump into the deep end and you swim""

Something else that seemed improbable to Mann in 1979 was that politics would be in the couple's future.

Warren was a Republican when they first met. She wouldn't change her party registration to Democrat until 1996. ""However conservative she might've been at the time, it was not particularly apparent and we really didn't discuss politics,"" Mann said.

But by 2011, Warren had made a name for herself in Washington, overseeing the Trouble Assets Relief Program after the financial crisis and conceiving of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama. That September, she mounted her first political campaign against Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown.

It was during this closely watched Senate race that Warren first came under fire for her past claims to Native American heritage. She would defeat Brown, handing the Democrats a major pick-up in the Senate, but the criticism of how Warren handled her family history lingered. Her campaign's decision last year to release the results of a DNA test, which showed distant Native American ancestry, was widely panned.

For Mann, who was close to Warren's extended family in Oklahoma, these criticisms were particularly painful.

""I knew everyone in her family, loved her family, knew all the stories that they had grown up with,"" Mann said. ""Because it was an attack on her family, it was one that was sort of probably the least pleasant of the attacks she's endured.""

As for the possibility that Warren would be up against Trump if she were to win the Democratic nomination, Mann was matter of fact.

""I'm not sure if anyone -- how anyone trains for it,"" he said. ""I mean for all of this, you just jump into the deep end and you swim.""

The couple also insisted that they do not talk about what life could be like at the White House. ""It's a bit early for that,"" Mann said. In the classroom, Mann said he never mentions his wife's name or the campaign, a boundary that his students have been respectful of.

""They observe that separation. It's probably killing them, but they're very good,"" he said.

Mann has not done any interviews this year, with the exception of a brief encounter with reporters outside of their Cambridge home on New Year's Eve, hours after Warren announced her exploratory campaign. Prompted for a comment, Mann had said that day: ""We've been married a long time and it's always been an adventure. So this is just another one.""

Asked how that adventure was going, Mann told CNN: ""Extraordinarily well.""

""Certainly back then, I had no idea what it would look like -- only that we would do it,"" he said. ""Every part of it remains an adventure. So I stand by that statement."""

Elizabeth Warren said she will not solicit wealthy donors and hold high-dollar fundraisers if she wins the Democratic presidential nomination, in a shift from earlier this year when she said that fundraising strategy was just for the primary contest.

When asked in an interview with CBS News released Tuesday whether she'd ""pivot"" or be ""forced"" to have big-dollar fundraisers if she won the nomination, Warren responded: ""No.""

""I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said. ""Look, for me this is pretty straight forward. Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it's about a grassroots, let's build this from the ground up.""

She later added: ""I'm not going to go do the big-dollar fundraisers. I'm just not going to do it.""

Despite her success with small-dollar donors during the primary, declining to raise big sums could put Warren at a significant financial disadvantage in a general-election battle with President Donald Trump. Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million during the July-to-September fundraising quarter -- fueled, in part, by six-figure donations collected at ritzy events. On a single day in August, for instance, Trump and the RNC raised $12 million at two fundraisers in the Hamptons.

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday challenged her Democratic primary rivals to release the names of contributors and fundraisers with influential positions on their campaigns, while pledging to champion legislation that would effectively disqualify big-dollar donors from being appointed to cushy diplomatic posts.

The requests were written into a series of mostly new proposed campaign finance restrictions, which would ban corporate PACs from donating to federal candidates and make it illegal for certain super PACs to be run by operatives with professional or personal ties to the candidate they're backing.

Now firmly among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, Warren has increasingly centered her campaign on a broad anti-corruption platform . In past rollouts, she promised to forbid lobbyists from making political contributions, acting as bundlers or hosting fundraisers for candidates. Former top federal officials -- including presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, judges, and cabinet secretaries -- would also be permanently prohibited from taking lobbying jobs.

While Warren does not name any of her competitors in her Medium post, the new call for campaigns to ""disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign, including national and regional finance committee members and bundler designations"" is an apparent nudge to a number of top rivals, like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who all regularly attend big-dollar fundraising events.

Warren's call to cut off the donor-to-ambassador pipeline, which she acknowledges has been common practice in both Republican and Democratic administrations, comes with increased resonance now that President Donald Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland , a Republican megadonor who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, has emerged as a key figure in the Ukraine scandal.

But she still needs to win over black voters,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/politics/elizabeth-warren-black-voters/index.html,"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) At an annual awards dinner hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, DC, last month, Rev. Jesse Jackson watched as a stream of attendees walked over to one 2020 Democratic candidate, looking to shake her hand, chat and take a photo together.

It was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , being approached ""all night long,"" Jackson said: ""People coming across the room to get a picture.""

The overwhelmingly positive reception that Warren received at the black-tie CBC gala wasn't the first time the senator has stood out this year at a forum of a largely black audience. Warren received a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference this summer as she presented her idea for bringing down the maternal mortality rate among black women ; in June, Jackson lavished her with praise at the Rainbow Push conference; and Warren appeared to be a crowd favorite at Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference in April, when she spoke about the acute challenges facing African-American homeowners.

But as Warren continues a steady climb in the national polls and now shares the front-runner status with former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren confronts a tough political reality. Those standout moments, coupled with public praise from African American leaders and activists, have yet to fully translate to support among black voters

According to a Quinnipiac national poll released on Tuesday, Warren is the top-choice candidate for 20% of black Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters. It is a notable improvement from the 10% support Warren had among black voters in an August Quinnipiac survey, but Biden still remains well ahead in support among blacks, at 36%.

Whether Warren can continue to improve her standing with this critical demographic group will be particularly important in the early voting state of South Carolina. A recent CNN poll showed Biden with a strong lead in the state, with the support of 45% of black likely primary voters. The same survey showed Warren with only 4% support among black voters in the state.

In an earlier Quinnipiac poll released at the end of September, seven in 10 black voters said they would be ""excited"" if Warren were the Democratic nominee, and 60% said they had a favorable view of the senator. But around two in 10 black voters said they still had not heard enough about Warren to have a favorable or unfavorable view of her. In contrast, 70% of those black voters said they had a favorable view of Biden, and only 5% said they hadn't heard enough about the former vice president to have a positive or negative opinion of him.

It has not gone unnoticed that some of Warren's events in South Carolina have featured largely white audiences. And despite the warm reception at the CBC dinner, Warren has not received endorsements from any black lawmakers in that caucus, unlike Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris.

On Wednesday, after another ""walking tour"" through a Charleston, South Carolina, neighborhood, Warren held a roundtable meeting with local residents, activists and leaders.

Asked by CNN how she would win over black voters who are far more familiar with Biden, Warren responded: ""I'm showing up, because I think that's really important -- showing up and shaking hands and talking with people.""

State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who joined Warren in the discussion and applauded her for visiting his constituents, told reporters that he believes Biden has a ""head start"" with black voters because of name recognition.

""But I caution all candidates: Things in the rear mirror are closer than they appear. It's a wide-open race, there are some built-in advantages based on name recognition, but all candidates including the vice president has to make the case,"" said Kimpson, who has not yet made an endorsement.

According to Jackson, who himself ran for President twice in the 1980s, he and Warren speak ""quite often."" The civil rights activists told CNN in an interview the senator has reached out to him periodically as she has mounted a bid for the White House.

""She appears to be fearless,"" Jackson said. He has not endorsed in the Democratic primary and said he is undecided on whether he will publicly back someone before the Iowa caucuses. ""People hear her and they respond to her. She has the capacity to arouse the base.""

""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith""

The Warren campaign has sought to reach out to the black community through its policy plans.

From her student loan debt forgiveness plan to her housing proposal to plans on closing private prisons and assisting entrepreneurs of color, Warren has integrated measures aimed specifically at African Americans in many of her policy outlines. Asked about outreach the senator has been doing this year to the black community, the campaign also pointed to ""listening sessions"" she has held with black activists and leaders throughout the year, including in Philadelphia ahead of the Netroots Nation conference.

And even as early as the spring, Warren was spending time in the south, in states that hold contests in March after the all-important early states. In March, she visited the Mississippi Delta for a ""walking tours"" of Cleveland and Greenville, Mississippi, to promote her rural housing plan, and also held campaign events in Tennessee and Alabama.

Ashlee Marie Preston, an African American transgender activist who has endorsed Warren, said she spoke with several other Democratic candidates before settling on Warren. It was in some ways an unexpected choice, she said, particularly given that there are two black candidates in the Democratic race: Sens. Harris and Cory Booker.

""I think it's easy to talk about racism in America -- it's another thing to be specific about the different layers about structural racism and systemic racism and how it continues to stand as a barrier to the poor and disenfranchised communities,"" Preston said. ""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith.""

Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which endorsed Warren last month, echoed Preston's sentiment.

""Identity is important but identity is insufficient. Simply because candidates happen to occupy the same racial identity of black voters doesn't mean it's in the bag for any candidate,"" Mitchell said. ""And black voters are incredibly sophisticated. They want to understand a candidate's history, a candidate's platform.""

Other African American Warren supporters -- particularly those who have known the senator voters will for years -- insist that her standing with black voters will improve as they get to know the candidate better.

""I'm troubled by the numbers in South Carolina, only because I know that folks in South Carolina don't know her like we know her -- members of the African American community in Boston,"" said Rev. Jeffrey Brown, an associate pastor of the 12th Baptist Church in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

For years, Warren has periodically attended services at the 12th Baptist Church, one of the oldest black churches in the Boston area. Brown said Warren personally calls to give him a heads-up before attending Sunday services, and that while he has asked her on multiple occasions to speak to the congregation, she has largely declined.

Remarking upon the Bible that Warren brings to church -- ""What I love about her Bible is that it's not brand new. And I've seen it. I've looked at it. It's a well-worn thing"" -- Brown said it is what he sees as the senator's understanding of the unique needs of African-Americans that leads him to believe that there is room for black support for Warren to grow.

But the reality is that Warren has less than four months left to introduce herself to black voters across the country and intensively court them, in contrast to the years she has had to get to know black voters in Massachusetts.

""I wish I could go down to South Carolina to some of these places and say look -- this is not a show... She's a real advocate for us,"" said Brown, who added he is ""a thousand percent"" behind Warren's candidacy. ""I wish I could go down there to some southern churches and preach about that."""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris all unveiled plans to expand LGBTQ protections and promote equal rights on Thursday, the day of an LGBTQ town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.

The three candidates, whose plans are all similar, list passing the Equality Act as a top priority. The bill, which has passed the House of Representatives but has not been taken up by the Senate, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected characteristics.

Warren, Buttigieg and Harris, along with several other 2020 Democrats, have been vocal about LGBTQ issues and rights throughout their presidential campaigns. Buttigieg stands out in the crowded 2020 Democratic field as someone who, if elected, would be the first man married to a same-sex partner to be president of the United States.

These plans come ahead of the CNN/Human Rights Campaign Foundation town hall, where Democratic presidential candidates will take questions from the audience and CNN journalists on specific LGBTQ concerns as well as their plans to promote equality and civility. The town hall will air Thursday from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET.

The three candidates pledge to reverse the Trump administration's rollbacks of LGBTQ protections, including the ban on transgender military service members and religious exemption policies. Warren writes the US must end ""the weaponization of religion to discriminate against or harm LGBTQ+ people.""

Bernie Sanders on how his sweeping health care plan -- which Warren has endorsed -- would be paid for.

""She's reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie campaign along with other revenue options. But she will only support pay-fors that meet the principles she has laid out in multiple debates,"" a Warren campaign aide said in a statement provided to CNN.

The campaign aide also said that the total cost of Medicare for All is unknown and that estimates vary by trillions of dollars. They did not provide details on what ""other revenue options"" the campaign is studying, and declined to comment on whether Warren may eventually put out her own details on paying for Medicare for All.

A new study by the Urban Institute , released Wednesday, said that federal spending on health care would increase by roughly $34 trillion under a single-payer plan similar to Medicare for All. That's in line with earlier studies that pegged the cost at around $32 trillion.

While Sanders has not detailed how he would raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicare for All, he included a variety of options when he released his 2016 campaign proposal and his updated bill in April. Among those listed in his most recent iteration are a 4% levy on employees, exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four. He also suggests imposing new taxes on employers, hiking the marginal tax rate on those making above $10 million, boosting the estate tax and establishing a wealth tax.

Warren's campaign statement comes on the heels of a contentious presidential debate Tuesday night in Ohio, where Warren was asked no less than half a dozen times on stage about whether Sanders' signature health care platform would raise taxes on the middle class and how she would like to pay for it.

Every time, the Massachusetts Democrat -- standing squarely center stage as a new front-runner in the 2020 Democratic race for President -- refused to state that taxes would, in fact, go up for some Americans under her colleague's plan. Instead, she stuck to a well-rehearsed response about how costs would go up for corporations and the wealthy and come down for middle class families. She pledged that as President, she would not sign a health care bill into law unless it lowered costs for average Americans.

Sanders has also stressed that while he would impose taxes on the middle class, they would see their overall costs go down because they would no longer have to pay premiums, deductibles or co-payments when they seek care.

Warren's repeated dodges on questions about whether Medicare for All would result in higher taxes are notably out of character for the senator, whose candidacy for the White House has gained steady political momentum in large part thanks to her abundance of policy plans and a knack for explaining and advocating for those ideas clearly out on the campaign trail.

Less than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Warren's support for Medicare for All has stood out as a rarity. Even as she has unveiled policy plans at a rapid clip since launching her campaign on New Year's Eve, on the issue of health care, Warren has chosen to hold back from releasing a proposal of her own. Instead, she has stuck to publicly backing Sanders' Medicare for All -- a bill that she co-sponsored in the Senate -- and has not said that she will release a comprehensive health care plan of her own in the 2020 race.

""I'm with Bernie,"" Warren has previously said when asked about her vision on health care.

Tuesday's debate laid bare the political risks of Warren's backing of Sanders' Medicare for All, and foreshadowed that she is likely to continue confronting questions and criticism about tax hikes that could result from Sanders' proposal.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg summed up Warren's predicament this way: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Former Vice President Joe Biden accused Warren of being ""vague.""

Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar also joined the chorus, imploring her Senate colleague to acknowledge what Sanders himself had said earlier in the evening: ""I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.""

""At least Bernie is being honest here, saying how he's going to pay for this -- taxes are going to go up,"" Klobuchar said. ""Sorry Elizabeth, you haven't said that. We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

The grilling continued well after the debate ended. In an interview with CNN anchors and analysts later that spanned close to 20 minutes, Warren was again pressed multiple times to acknowledge that Sanders' Medicare for All plan would result in tax hikes for some American families. Once again, she stuck to her script.

""My commitment is: I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families,"" Warren said.

There have been earlier signs that Warren and her campaign were leaving open wiggle room on Medicare for All.

At a town hall in Keene, New Hampshire, last month, Warren referred to Medicare for All as a ""framework,"" saying: ""Right now, what we've got in Medicare for All is a framework and it doesn't have the details.""

The senator's senior adviser on the campaign, Joe Rospars , echoed that sentiment in a recent podcast interview, saying that some significant details have yet to be filled in on Sanders' Medicare for All plan.

""The question of the pay-for is: There's still a lot of details still to be filled in, in terms of both Bernie's bill that's out there but also the other versions of it, other candidates have their specific plans,"" Rospars said.

A veteran of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, Rospars also said that he believes it's the ""overall cost"" of Medicare for All that most voters are focused on.

""I think there's a kind of disingenuousness to the — well, let's talk about taxes part of it,"" he said."

Bernie Sanders on his right and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to his left, for the next presidential debate, which will also feature a new face and a returning candidate among the dozen Democrats onstage vying for their party's nomination.

The stakes are incredibly high for the candidates participating in the CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate on October 15, as several candidates will likely need a breakout performance to remain competitive in this crowded primary field. For businessman Tom Steyer , it will be his first presidential debate, while Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard returns to the stage after failing to qualify for the September debate.

In all, 12 Democratic hopefuls will appear on the same stage for the debate: Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

The Democratic National Committee's fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, a northeast suburb of the state capital, Columbus. CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey will serve as the debate moderators.

The 12 campaigns were required to submit paperwork to the DNC Wednesday morning certifying that their respective candidate achieved the fundraising and polling thresholds required to participate in the October debate. To receive an invitation to this debate, candidates needed to attain at least 2% in four separate DNC-approved polls and receive contributions from at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors from 20 different states.

He's followed closely by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose haul over the same period was at $24.6 million, her campaign said.

The two senators raised millions more in the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, than the combination of the next three candidates who have so far announced their numbers.

Former Vice President Joe Biden amassed $15.2 million, according to his campaign, marking a decline from his previous fundraising haul, as did South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who raised $19.1 million. California Sen. Kamala Harris came in at $11.6 million, a sum consistent with her previous hauls.

Not every candidate has released their fundraising numbers yet. The deadline to file their third-quarter reports with the Federal Election Commission is October 15.

1. More upheaval at Homeland Security

""He had actually been able to curb border crossings and implement some of the administration's harshest policies, but he never really developed a trust with the President,"" Washington Post White House reporter Josh Dawsey said.

""Immigration is the core issue of his presidency,"" Dawsey said. ""So he has to find the fifth person in three years to lead the agency that's really key to his reelection.""

2. Democrats move closer to obtaining Trump's taxes

Democrats are closer than ever to getting their hands on a copy of Trump's tax returns.

The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that Congress has every right to subpoena Trump's accounting firm for the returns as part of its oversight authority.

""The courts are starting to come to House Democrats' rescue,"" Washington Post congressional reporter Rachael Bade said. ""The problem for them is that the President of course is going to appeal this decision -- all of the decisions are going to end up in the Supreme Court, so it might not matter for now because they're going to keep dragging this out.""

Bade said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has suggested legislation that would require courts to move faster -- though it would have to pass the Republican-controlled Senate to become law.

3. A runoff in Louisiana

Bad news for Democrats in Saturday's Louisiana gubernatorial election.

Incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards failed to secure 50% of the vote against two Republicans who split the GOP vote -- which means now he's got a tougher one-on-one race with Republican Eddie Rispone.

""That makes his prospects much more difficult,"" Associated Press Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace said, adding that it's a bad omen for the few Democratic elected officials left in the South.

""Edwards is the perfect profile for a Democrat in the deep South,"" Pace said. ""Another Democrat to watch in a similar circumstance is Alabama's Doug Jones, he's up for reelection next year. And Democrats need to hang on to that seat if they have any prospects of getting the Senate back. They have really, really tough prospects in the South.""

4. Warren on health care

But can the 2020 Democratic presidential contender get away with that line again at Tuesday's debate?

""I'm going to be looking out for how she responds to questions about Medicare for all,"" Wall Street Journal national political reporter Tarini Parti said. ""This is an issue her primary opponents have really been questioning her on, how she's going to pay for it.""

Parti said a source familiar with Warren's thinking told her they don't know yet what Medicare for All would cost, and so don't know yet what kind of revenue is needed to pay for it.

""So that's why they say she isn't responding to whether it's going to lead to an increase in taxes or not,"" Parti said. ""Different plans have different costs associated with them, so they're still trying to figure that part out.""

5. What's Gabbard's game?

And from CNN senior political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson:

While Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has said she is ""seriously considering"" boycotting Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate over what she says is a rigged process, our guess is that the Democratic presidential candidate will very likely be there in Ohio.

And if her July debate appearance is any guide, a few people on that stage should worry. Gabbard has proven to be a wild card in the Democratic primary, where she is polling at about 2%.

She got the best of California Sen. Kamala Harris in a previous debate, and Tuesday is a chance for a rematch. And for Gabbard it's also a chance to go after any number of other candidates -- like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- as they vie to move up in the polls.

While those candidates look to make gains by going after candidates in the center of the stage, they might also want to be ready for what could come from the far ends of it, where some of the sharpest attacks have often been launched by candidates with little to lose."

The law that established the CFPB says the President may not remove the director except for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.""

But critics -- including the Trump administration, current director Kathleen Kraninger , as well as a law firm fighting a CFPB-led investigation -- argue in court briefs that a restriction on the President's authority to remove the director at will, including over policy disagreements, ""violates the Constitution's separation of powers.""

In a move that could prove critical, the court also said it will entertain the question of whether the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that created the bureau should also be struck.

That move ""radically ratchets up the stakes of what was already a high-stakes separation-of-powers dispute,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

The tagline — with its unfortunate double-meaning — was reported by the Washington Post, which obtained excerpts of the speech in advance, merely hours after several new polls suggested that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had surged past Biden into first place in the race for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination.

A Monmouth Poll of early primary states released Wednesday found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (25%) by 3% — barely within the poll’s 3.1% margin of error. A new YouGov/Economist poll found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (22%) by 6%.

Moreover, the breaking news that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 78, had been admitted to hospital for emergency heart surgery also drew attention to Biden’s age (76) and his own history of health problems.

Still, Biden wanted Trump — and Democrats — to know that he would fight on, in response to Trump’s charges that he and his son, Hunter, were “stone-cold crooked.” The Washington Post reported from his remarks, as prepared for delivery:

“Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me — I’m not going anywhere,” Biden will say. “You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.” … Biden said Trump sought to discredit him and his family because, “like every bully in history—he’s afraid. He’s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.”

The Post concluded its story by quoting Biden: “Nobody has ever asserted that I did anything wrong except he and what’s that fellow’s name? Rudy Udi? Giuliani?”

It's lost on no one, of course, she's talking about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

After making that point clear during the debate last week in Ohio -- calling for a ""reality check to Elizabeth"" and dismissing some Warren plans as ""pipe dreams"" -- Klobuchar is scrambling to turn her moment on stage into momentum on the campaign trail.

Klobuchar, who has so far qualified for all of the primary debates but continues to see single-digit polling numbers, is in danger of missing the November debate stage.

With less than a month to qualify, a fresh sense of urgency surrounded her candidacy as her green campaign bus rumbled across Iowa on a visit this past weekend. Her itinerary was shaped by a swath of counties President Donald Trump turned red in 2016 that President Barack Obama twice carried.

At every stop, whether shaking hands with one potential supporter at a time or addressing a room of a few hundred, Klobuchar made the case again and again: She can win in Trump country and Democrats can ill afford to choose a nominee who can't.

In this unsettled stage of the race, she's testing the appetite for whether hard-core party activists who dependably attend Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses are open to backing a candidate who promotes her progressive record even as she touts the number of Republicans -- or former Republicans -- who approach her to pledge their support.

""Who do you want heading that ticket? Someone who can really win in the Midwest,"" Klobuchar told CNN in an interview aboard her chartered bus, emblazoned with the slogan ""Amy for America"" in giant letters. ""I'm the only one with the track record of actually winning red congressional districts time and time again and suburban purple districts.""

The Minnesota senator carried so-called Trump counties -- 42 of them, she proudly pointed out to her Iowa audiences, as she won a third Senate term last fall. She argues that her presidential candidacy could also build a broader coalition to help Democratic candidates win control of the Senate next year.

But in the short term, it's an open question whether her pragmatic message can be a winning one in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary.

""She has a very refreshing, common sense way about her that is very appealing,"" said Andy McKean, a longtime Iowa state legislator who left the Republican Party earlier this year in disgust. Now a Democrat, he endorsed Klobuchar, saying: ""She's very practical, but she's very progressive.""

It's that balance Klobuchar is working to navigate.

Her rising confidence, which was apparent on the debate stage last week in Ohio, clearly followed her at most every stop of her three-day Iowa visit. One voter after another conceded they took notice of her for the first time when she aggressively challenged Warren on the price tag of her health care plan.

Betsy Pilkington, a retired teacher from North English, Iowa, said she was so impressed by Klobuchar's most recent debate performance that she went online and made a small contribution. It was the biggest fundraising boomlet of Klobuchar's campaign, aides said, raising more than $1 million in the first 24 hours after the debate. (By comparison, Klobuchar raised a total $4.8 million from July to September.)

""For the first time, I thought she came across more forceful and she was a force to recon with,"" Pilkington said in an interview after meeting Klobuchar at a coffee shop along her tour. ""I liked what she had to say, that she was more centrist and she wasn't afraid to go up against Elizabeth Warren.""

Pragmatic and progressive

Klobuchar and Warren, who are colleagues in the Senate and competitors on the campaign trail, illustrate the tensions coursing through the Democratic Party and the lingering uncertainty over what type of candidate is the most electable.

The root of their disagreement is over the price tag of a series of programs, including ""Medicare for All"" and free college. Klobuchar was among the Democrats who did not sign onto the sweeping legislation sponsored by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, which would eliminate private health insurance.

In the wake of persistent questioning of Warren on the debate stage from Klobuchar and others, the Massachusetts senator said Sunday for the first time that she is working on a plan to pay for Medicare for All and would reveal it in the coming weeks.

That development prompted this reply from Klobuchar: ""I think if she had a good answer, we would have seen it by now. But I look forward to seeing it.""

Their candidacies are far from equal -- Warren's robust grassroots fundraising prowess and wild enthusiasm apparent at most every one of her campaign stops make that evident -- but Klobuchar's assertive questioning of Warren on the debate stage clearly found a receptive audience.

""How is college going to be free? How is health care going to be free? How are we going to close down all private health insurance?"" said Susan Strodtbeck, a retired teacher who saw Klobuchar at a town hall meeting in Davenport. ""I'm sorry. We can't do that.""

When she asked Klobuchar about ""all that free stuff,"" the senator's face came alive as she joked that the only free offerings her campaign had were the chocolate chip cookies at the back of the room.

While Klobuchar has offered a pragmatic progressive message since she entered the race in February, the decision to sharpen her argument against Warren and Sanders, another top-tier candidate, is a strategic one. Time is running out for her to break out of the crowded field, with a little more than 100 days remaining until the Iowa caucuses kick off the voting early next year.

After sipping a cup of hot coffee, Klobuchar settled back into her seat on the bus, and explained why she believes that her rivals aren't leveling with voters.

""I'm not at all likening them to Donald Trump, who's plainly lying all the time,"" she said. ""But I'm saying that I think this calls for a time when we build trust with people, not by promising everything for free. I know that's appealing. I would love to have everything for free. You'd love to have everything for free, but I think people know that's not going to happen.""

She dismissed the possibility of backlash from liberal Democrats to her sharp criticism of Warren and Sanders. She defends her progressive voting record, while making clear that the party needs to appeal to a wider audience of Americans eager to see Trump replaced in the White House.

""There are independents and moderate Republicans -- maybe they didn't vote last time, but they're watching,"" Klobuchar said. ""So we better make sure that the message we're sending out there is one that brings them in as well.""

As she posed for pictures with voters at a brewery in Waterloo, Jerry Rasmussen stood and watched from a distance. He's a retired truck driver who said he's fed up with the Trump presidency and learned about Klobuchar from a friend in neighboring Minnesota.

""He's a Republican and says she does a great job for him up there, you know?"" Rasmussen said. ""I hope she can get stronger and pull ahead."""

It was a rough-and-tumble welcome in the arena for a candidate who has gamely sidestepped attacks in previous debates. But at the CNN/New York Times debate Tuesday night in the crucial swing state of Ohio, the Massachusetts senator was constantly on defense driving her central argument that Democrats must ""dream big"" and ""fight hard."" All the fire sent in Warren's direction at Otterbein University underscored a marked shift in the Democratic race that has been underway for many weeks: while former Vice President Joe Biden has remained strong in the polls, the other candidates in the race clearly now see Warren as the real competition.

It was one of the first times Warren had to face a barrage of critiques from her Democratic competitors, navigating many of the critical comments usually aimed toward Biden or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

It was the moderates in the race who targeted the newly minted front-runner the most. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg set that aggressive tone from the opening moments of the debate as he sought to seize the centrist lane within the Democratic field. Challenging Warren on her refusal to answer a yes-or-no questions about whether her plan would lead to tax hikes from the middle class, he said her evasiveness embodied the very reason why Americans are so frustrated with Washington.

""Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" Buttigieg said to Warren. ""No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.""

In a strong performance, Buttigieg repeatedly argued that Democrats would not be able to sell some of Warren's more liberal ideas -- namely ""Medicare for All"" -- to the broader universe of voters that the party must sway to win the White House.

""I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage is to obliterate private plans,"" Buttigieg said to Warren. ""We're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be polarized, more than now. After everything we have been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be more divided. Why divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?""

Warren did not back down, but at times seemed surprised by the force of the attacks against her -- even from the normally mild-mannered former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke who accused her of embracing a philosophy that was punitive.

""Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,"" she said.

Buttigieg's arguments were often amplified by Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also leaned heavily on her Midwestern roots to argue that Warren and Sanders have driven the party too far to the left. In one tense exchange, the Minnesota senator referred to ""Medicare for All"" -- a proposal that was crafted by Sanders and endorsed by Warren -- as a ""pipe-dream.""

""The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,"" Klobuchar said.

""At least Bernie is being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this -- and that taxes are going to go up,"" she added. ""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

At another point Warren was repeatedly badgered by California Sen. Kamala Harris, who tried to force her into agreeing with Harris's proposal that Trump should be thrown off Twitter. It was then that Warren showed a touch of exasperation.

""Look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,"" Warren said.

Biden touts record, Sanders thanks well-wishers

While he often receded into the background on Tuesday night, Biden argued that he had done bigger things than anyone else on stage, citing the Violence Against Women Act as one example.

Though he did not take on Warren as aggressively as some of the others, he tried at one point to take credit for getting the votes in Congress to make her idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a reality. ""I got votes for that bill,"" Biden said, referring to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that established the bureau. ""I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight too,"" he said.

Pushing back on that idea, Warren offered her thanks to Biden's then-boss, President Barack Obama and everyone else who helped create the agency -- pointedly not mentioning the former vice president.

""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" Warren said.

Biden, grinning as he stood beside her, graciously offered a compliment: ""You did a hell of a job in your job,"" he said to her.

""Thank you,"" she replied.

When the conversation turned to the age of the three leading candidates -- Biden, Sanders and Warren -- who are all in their 70s, Biden also sought to frame his age as an asset. He promised to release his health records, along with some two decades of his tax information.

""Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience,"" Biden said. ""With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.""

Sanders, who was back on the trail for the first time since his heart attack, tried to allay any concerns about his stamina by stating that he's ""healthy"" and ""feeling great."" The 78-year-old also offered his thanks for the well wishes he has received over the past two weeks.

""Let me take this moment if I might to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes,"" he said. ""And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.""

Gabbard spars with Buttigieg

Facing the Democratic Party's increasingly difficult threshold to make the next debate in Georgia, some of the lower tier candidates clearly knew that they needed to generate a jolt of energy for their campaigns on Tuesday night. But the only candidate at that level who drew notice was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran who served in the Army, has called for US troops to leave Syria and she sparred with Buttigieg -- the only other veteran on the stage -- over US engagement in that conflict.

The Hawaii congresswoman criticized Trump's sudden decision to abandon Kurdish forces near the northern Syrian border -- a move that essentially opened the door for a Turkish military offensive against the longtime US allies. She described the ""slaughter of Kurds"" by Turkey as a consequence of ""the regime-change war that we've been waging in Syria.""

""Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hands -- but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011,"" Gabbard said, ""along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.""

Buttigieg, who served in the Navy Reserve, told Gabbard she was ""dead wrong.""

""The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,"" Buttigieg said.

He noted that he did not support going into Iraq and believes that the US should get out of Afghanistan, but said it was also the case that ""a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.""

""When I was deployed I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the flag on my shoulder represented a country that kept its word,"" Buttigieg said. ""You take that away, it takes away what makes America America."""
536,"Analysis by Brandon Tensley, CNN",,"It was another instance of that most common of events: a woman, diminished.",2019-10-09,CNN,Analysis: Warren pregnancy debate another example of sexism in the guise of scrutiny,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-pregnancy-discrimination-sexism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) It was another instance of that most common of events: a woman, diminished.

Earlier this week, Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate, was asked about a story that she's mentioned often on the campaign trail: In 1971, when she was 22 years old and completing her first year of teaching, she lost her job once it became clear that she was visibly pregnant. It was, she tweeted , ""an experience millions of women will recognize.""

But over the past few days, conservative news sites and mainstream outlets either have sought to directly refute Warren's account or have disputed it in such a way that it seems as if there's some reason to doubt that a school in the early 1970s would fire a pregnant woman. But that kind of discrimination continues today. (As The New York Times documented earlier this year , American companies still ""systematically sideline"" pregnant women by, for instance, passing them over for promotions.)

Warren's story, however, fits into a much larger pattern, one that will indeed be familiar to many women: It's the tradition of sexism in the guise of scrutiny.

Consider how, this same week, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, another Democratic presidential hopeful, was pulled into a case at the global law firm DLA Piper , where a junior partner alleges that one of the company's higher-ups sexually assaulted her four times. Harris' only connection to the firm is that her husband is one of its hundreds of partners.

Yet that hasn't prevented the junior partner's lawyer from trying to use Harris' star power to bring attention to a case not meaningfully related to the senator. (In response, a statement from Harris' communications director underscores that the senator ""has been and continues to be a staunch advocate for survivors and believes all people must be guaranteed their day in court."")

By contrast, in the wake of the revelation last week that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont suffered a heart attack , that gendered line of questioning has been noticeably absent from political chatter. Sanders, instead, has received the kid-gloves treatment.

Each of these examples is, in its own way, a distillation of age-old policing mechanisms and double standards. Each also shines a light on the inveterate sexism -- women as unreliable narrators, women as answerable for their husbands' professional lives, women as weak -- that still, today, takes up so much space in the narrative.

Or to use Warren's own words, ""I don't know what else you'd call it."""

CNBC reports that during a livestreamed employee Q&A call this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed a number of topics including politics. Zuckerberg was asked to respond to Senator Bernie Sanders’s comment that billionaires should not exist, and gave a surprising answer given that Zuckerberg himself is worth $69 billion.

“I understand where he’s coming from,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t know that I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level no one deserves to have that much money.”

Zuckerberg was also asked about comments he made during two separate leaked internal Q&A sessions he had with employees in July. Zuckerberg is quoted as saying: “You have someone like Elizabeth Warren that thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.”

Zuckerberg adds: “And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that’s not the position that you want to be in when you’re, you know, I mean … It’s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.”

Zuckerberg stated in the recent public Q&A that he stands by his comments about Warren but added: “let’s try not to antagonize her further.” Zuckerberg was also asked about how the firm determines what counts as fake news that should be removed, Zuckerberg clarified that the main objective is to stamp out “complete and obvious hoaxes.”

“When we talk about misinformation, a lot of people focus on a statement that isn’t clear if it’s a shade of true or partially false,” he said. “There’s a lot of stuff that people say that is completely false. That’s the thing that I’m really focused on and making sure that we [stop].”

Buttigieg campaign spokesperson Chris Meagher confirmed both Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan provided details on several names, two of which were eventually hired, in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Nina Wornhoff, now a data manager for the Buttigieg campaign, previously worked as a machine learning engineer at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple’s philanthropic arm. Eric Mayefsky, a digital analytics adviser for the Democrat presidential candidate, worked at Facebook between 2010-2014.

Newly confirmed details of Zuckerberg’s communication with the Buttigieg campaign is a “rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech’s most powerful executives,” Bloomberg’s Tyler Pager and Kurt Wagner write.

Of course, news of the emails is not the first time the two have crossed paths. In 2017, Zuckerberg and Buttigieg, both Harvard University alumni, hosted a Facebook Live discussion during the Facebook CEO’s Midwest listening tour. The South Bend mayor made headlines in May when he expressed support for additional regulations on Silicon Valley giants like Facebook, despite his relationship with Zuckerberg.

Bloomberg News’ report comes as a new poll released Monday shows that Buttigieg has risen to third place in the key primary state of Iowa.

The Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll states that former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) enjoy 18 percent and 17 percent approval from voters, while Buttigieg has garnered 13 percent.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been hospitalized with serious heart problems, what had already been a bad week for former Vice President Joe Biden has just gotten even worse.

I’ll get to the why of that in a bit, but let’s first take a look at all the other bad news.

The Polls

As I have said since the beginning, the only polls I’m going to take seriously are post-Labor Day, after summer is over and people are actually paying attention to the race. It was and still is my belief that while enjoying the summer months, Democrat voters parked their votes on tried-and-true Uncle Joe but that this could change after people started to tune in.

Well, tuning in, they are, and Biden’s slide is very real and may not have yet reached bottom.

According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Biden went from a double-digit national lead ten days ago to just a two-point lead today.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is climbing, is attracting the crowds, while Slow Joe falls and can hardly attract flies.

In the all-important early primary states, Biden is losing in Iowa, is only three points up in New Hampshire (Warren leads in the two most recent polls), and only two points up in Nevada. (Warren and Biden are tied in the latest poll.)

Biden’s firewall in South Carolina remains strong — he’s up by 22 points, but if he loses New Hampshire and Iowa, he will have to make history to win the Democrat nomination.

The Picture

Last month, Joe Biden told us, “I’ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

That is a flat-out lie.

This entire scandal revolves around Biden’s son Hunter, who made more than $50,000 a month — a month! — for sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil company. The problem, of course, is that Hunter has no experience whatsoever in that field and that when Hunter scored that sweet gig, then-President Obama had put Joe Biden in charge of dealing with Ukraine.

What’s more, once a Ukrainian prosecutor began to look into Hunter’s company, Joe threatened to withhold crucial U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired — which he was.

Now, liars in the media, serial liars like Jake Tapper, are lying about this — saying the prosecutor was not looking into Hunter Biden’s company when Daddy Joe forced him out, but this very same prosecutor has signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury saying that he was.

Anyway, back to the lie…

To begin with, we know Daddy Joe spoke to Hunter about his shady, overseas business dealings because in an interview with the New Yorker, Hunter said they spoke about his shady, overseas business dealings.

But now, we have nothing less than photographic proof…

Look at this, y’all… An actual photograph of then-Vice President Joe Biden and his ne’er-do-well son out golfing with a board member of the company that hired No-Experience-Hunter.

That’s whatchoo call a clean bust.

The Pulmonary

While we all hope and pray Bernie Sanders makes a full and speedy recovery, the political reality of the matter is still the political reality of the matter.

While on the campaign trail, Bernie felt chest pains, was rushed to the hospital, and surgery was performed to implant two heart stents. Bernie is still in the hospital, his presidential campaign is suspended, as is his political advertising.

This is a serious and significant development, but not just for Bernie.

Bernie Sanders is 78-years-old.

Joe Biden will be 77 next month.

And let’s not forget that until today’s news, Bernie was by far the most robust and energetic of the two.

After all, it was Joe Biden’s eye that filled with blood on TV just a few weeks ago, and it was Joe Biden’s teeth that came loose during a national debate last month, and it has been Joe Biden taking it easy on the campaign trail, going on vacation, disappearing for days at a time, etc.

If Democrats are smart, they will remember the lesson of 2016 when an obviously frail, sickly, and weak Hillary Clinton collapsed into a van at that September 11 memorial event.

While I have always made fun of Bernie’s age, I have also always used him as an example of what a robust 78-year-old looks like, how it is possible to be virile and vibrant into your late seventies. In fact, I have used Bernie as an example to explain just how frail and old Joe Biden looks by comparison.

Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the idea of Trump’s second term, and Bernie’s health scare will probably serve as a reality check that will have them rethinking their support for these pushing-80 candidates. What they are imagining right now is what a catastrophe this would have been had Bernie won the general election.

Naturally, then, these thoughts are going to turn to Slow Joe and the fact that if this happened to Bernie, there is an even bigger chance it will happen to Joe, who was never as energetic or full of fire as Bernie.

This reality check could also hurt Warren, who is 70. If she wins the nomination, she will be 71 and the oldest presidential nominee (from either party) in history.

Sure, Warren seems spry and energetic but … so did Bernie.

Regardless, this has been a very bad week for Quid Pro Joe … and it is only Wednesday.

In public, Zuckerberg is all humility. Mark Zuckerberg: “I’m Really Sorry That This Happened” could be any headline about a Facebook data scandal in the past two years. His 2018 speech to European politicians was an apology. His remarks before Congress were an apology. After the Cambridge Analytica affair, Facebook took out full-page newspaper ads in ten newspapers, apologizing.

In private, however, the Facebook CEO sings a different tune, promising defiance against regulators and politicians, and joking about how he can’t be fired.

In leaked audio obtained by the Verge, Zuckerberg pledges to fight against any regulation of big tech pushed by Elizabeth Warren or any other politician.

That doesn’t mean that, even if there’s anger and that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge….at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.

He said it was particularly important that Facebook and other big tech companies aren’t broken up, because only they’re big enough to censor everyone — or stop “hate speech,” in the Facebook founder’s words.

You know, [breaking up big tech] doesn’t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can’t coordinate and work together. It doesn’t make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now … all the processes that we’re putting in place and investing in, now we’re more fragmented. [emphasis added]

He also mocked Twitter for not being big enough to censor as efficiently as Facebook.

It’s why Twitter can’t do as good of a job as we can. I mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues. But they can’t put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company. [laughter]

Zuckerberg’s answer to global scrutiny from national governments? Just ignore them, if they’re not big enough to matter! (Fun fact, Facebook has revenues greater than the GDP of Serbia, and would be the 90th-wealthiest country in the world if it were a country).

I did hearings in the US. I did hearings in the EU. It just doesn’t really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up and, frankly, doesn’t have jurisdiction to demand that.

Does the arrogance and the commitment to massive investments to fight “hate speech” concern you? Too bad — Zuckerberg isn’t going anywhere:

kind of have voting control of the company, and that’s something I focused on early on. And it was important because, without that, there were several points where I would’ve been fired. For sure, for sure…

In the early days of Facebook, reporters obtained a now-infamous message from Zuckerberg in which he mocked the platform’s users as “dumb f**cks” for trusting him with their personal data.

Insincere contrition in public, and cavalier arrogance in private. Not much has changed!

In Thursday's letter, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz blasted Facebook for what he called a ""deeply flawed"" policy, saying it gives ""blanket permission"" for candidates to use the platform to ""mislead American voters all while Facebook profits from their advertising dollars."" The ad was paid for by a political action committee called The Committee to Defend the President.

Schultz wrote that the campaign will continue to mount challenges, saying, ""In the coming days and weeks, Facebook will be hearing from us about these concerns, which are shared by countless other candidates, citizens, and organizations that prioritize the health of American democracy.""

In an email obtained by CNN from Facebook's head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, Facebook replied that the ad in question is not currently active on the platform.

""The ad you wrote us about is currently inactive on our platform and is not running. Should it become active it would then be sent to third party fact checkers where they would have the option to review it,"" Harbath said."

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are riding waves of small donations. Billionaire Tom Steyer plowed eye-popping sums into his presidential campaign. And one White House contender reported raising just $5 during an entire three-month period. That's not a typo: yes, $5.

Here's a look at some of the key takeaways from third-quarter reports Democratic candidates just filed with federal election regulators:

Joe Biden burned through his money

Biden burned through his campaign donations over the summer -- spending more money than he took in and leaving him with just a fraction of the cash available to several of his better-funded rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Biden's campaign entered October with $8.98 million remaining in its bank account, after spending more than $17.6 million during the July-to-September quarter.

Biden raised nearly $15.7 million during the quarter, according to a report filed by his campaign late Tuesday, shortly after the conclusion of the Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.

Biden's cash position a little more than three months before the Iowa caucuses puts him at a big financial disadvantage to rivals such as Sanders, who reported having $33.7 million stockpiled for the primary slog ahead.

Two other Democratic presidential candidates -- Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- have each stockpiled more than $20 million.

What's Biden spending money on? One-quarter of Biden's spending in the three-month period went to payroll, his filings show. His campaign also spent more than $920,000 on private planes.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday night following the debate, Biden's aides downplayed the campaign's financial hurdles.

""We've always said that we think this race is going to be a dog fight, that it's going to go long,"" campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said. ""We are 100% confident that we have what we need to run our race.""

Small donations add up for Sanders, Warren

Sanders relied on small-dollar donations for about 60% of his contributions over the summer -- giving him a pool of donors to tap repeatedly before they hit legal contribution limits.

Nearly $15 million -- or about 61% -- of the money Warren raised from individual contributors during the July-to-September fundraising quarter came from donors who donated $200 or less to the senator's presidential campaign. That helped her post one of the biggest fundraising hauls in the crowded field of Democrats vying to face President Donald Trump next year.

By comparison, small donations accounted for less than a third of Biden's donors.

Warren and Sanders, who represent the ultra-progressive wing of their party, swore off big-dollar fundraising in their campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination, and their financial strength underscores the enthusiasm of online donors in the 2020 election.

They both outraised Biden and Buttigieg -- candidates who have relied, in part, on larger donors to fuel their White House ambitions.

""The concept is now proven: Candidates who want to focus on the people's agenda and be fueled by the people can totally succeed,"" Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a Warren supporter, told CNN this week. ""That's a sea change.""

Warren recently promised to go further and forgo high-dollar fundraisers in the general election should she win the nomination, a stance that drew sharp criticism from Buttigieg.

""We're not going to beat Donald Trump with pocket change,"" he told Snapchat host Peter Hamby this week.

Staying power for Buttigieg, too

Buttigieg also spent heavily in the July-to-September period -- as he raced to assemble a staff of more than 300 nationally and build a ground game in Iowa ahead of the February 3 caucuses.

He raised a solid $19.1 million during the third quarter -- falling behind only Sanders and Warren. Despite his heavy spending, Buttigieg's strong fundraising over the course of the year has left him flush with cash. He started October with nearly $23.4 million available in his campaign accounts.

His campaign attracted some bold-faced donors in recent months, including designer Isaac Mizrahi and actresses Alyssa Milano and Jennifer Garner.

But here's a sobering statistic for Buttigieg and the entire Democratic field: Trump's campaign committee started October with $83.2 million in leftover funds. That's more cash on hand than held by the three top Democratic fundraisers combined.

Self-funding candidates

Steyer plowed a staggering $47.6 million of his hedge-fund fortune into his longshot bid for the White House, filings show. Other contributors donated $2 million, helping him fulfill the minimum donor threshold set by the Democratic National Committee to join Tuesday's debate.

Steyer is not the only self-funder in the race.

Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney continues to put his own money into the race. He donated $400,000 of his own funds to the campaign in the third quarter of this year.

How low can you go?

Among the 12 Democratic candidates who faced off on Tuesday night's debate stage, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro faces the biggest financial peril. The former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, raised nearly $3.5 million, but had just $672,000 remaining in his bank account at the end of September.

Former Reps. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii had $3.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively, remaining in their bank accounts. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also joined Tuesday's debate and made forceful attacks on Warren, had nearly $3.7 million left over in her campaign accounts.

Way, way back in the fundraising pack: Wayne Messam, the Miramar, Florida, mayor who has never gained traction in the Democratic presidential nomination.

His campaign reported receipts of exactly $5 in the July-to-September fundraising period in its filing with the Federal Election Commission. And because federal law doesn't require candidates to report details on donors who provide $200 or less to a campaign, it's hard to tell who provided the money. (Messam has had to correct his filings in the past; earlier this year he filed an amended report after mistakenly reporting he had raised nearly twice as much as he had actually collected.)

Tuesday's reports show the Democrat still had a little more than $31,000 remaining in his campaign's bank account.

(CNN) President Donald Trump's ears must have been burning as Democrats met in Ohio at the most crowded presidential debate in US history on Tuesday.

The 12 candidates at the CNN/New York Times debate conjured up visions of a vastly different America should they evict him from the White House in 2020. They'd reverse Trump's erratic, ""America First"" twists and turns, and restore the US leadership in the world -- somehow. But as the heated exchanges on health care, tax and billionaires showed, the Democratic Party still doesn't know how far left it wants to go.

Who won and lost a debate often takes a few days to become clear as viral moments ignite on social media and voters chew over the post-game analysis. But the early money suggests that this debate will not shake up the wider shape of the race. Former Vice President Joe Biden is a wobbly front runner. Elizabeth Warren has joined him in the top tier (and attacks that she faced on Tuesday night -- the most withering of her career -- show that the rest of the field knows it.)

While some outsiders did well -- like 30-something Pete Buttigieg and centrist Senator Amy Klobuchar, who brought sharp knives for Warren -- everyone else is still struggling to get a look in.

Four takeaways that will shape the campaign

The shadow of impeachment

Joe Biden, reaching for gravitas, said Trump's presidency was ""the most corrupt in modern history and all of our history."" Kamala Harris said the President had ""committed crimes in plain sight."" Elizabeth Warren said this was ""bigger than politics."" Whatever happens with the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump will tear America even further apart. And if one of the men or women on stage beats him at the polls, they'll end up with the job of trying to put it back together.

What about the Kurds?

All of the candidates agreed Trump was wrong to abruptly remove US troops from the side of Kurdish allies in Syria. But there was a strong isolationist strain onstage, in keeping with the mood of a nation exhausted by foreign wars. Co-frontrunner Warren did not quarrel with Trump's instinct to bring troops home, just with how he's doing it. ""I think we want to get out of the Middle East. I do think we should do it responsibly,"" she said. Until further notice, that is America's message to the rest of the world.

So that's what it's like to be a front-runner

Elizabeth Warren now knows what it's like to have a target on her back. Her rise to effective co-front-runner status exposed her to attacks from all sides on Tuesday. Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar piled on -- seeking to grab the middle ground of many Democrats who fear Warren and Sanders are too left wing. ""The difference between a plan and a pipedream is something you can actually get done,"" said Klobuchar, desperate for a viral moment as she struggles to reach polling thresholds to get her into the next debate.

In one of the most electric moments of the campaign, Biden and Warren -- the two most likely nominees -- clashed directly for the first time.

What heart attack?

Those two stents inserted into one of Bernie Sanders' arteries did the trick. The Vermont senator was ""feeling great"" and keen to wrest the debate away from Trump-bashing and back to his wheelhouse: health care, student debt and getting rid of billionaires. Sanders supporters will be relieved. But millions of moderate Americans watching at home might be more concerned at his frank admission that taxes will go up to pay for his ambitious social reforms.

Shameful. Shameful!

That was Biden letting off steam at Trump's decision to let Syria roll into northeastern Syria at the expense of America's Kurdish allies. The former vice president has much to vent about the President.

Brexit interlude

There's a generally held view of the European Union as an 11th hour decision-maker, working its way out of difficulties with late-night summits fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and pastries, and prime ministers and presidents only staggering out after midnight to announce a breakthrough.

Sometimes that really is what happens (it's also not uncommon for heads of state convening in Brussels to nip out for frites and a beer during negotiating breaks) but that's not how the EU likes to do things.

In fact, the European Council prefers to have its agenda set two weeks ahead of each summit. That gives the Commission -- its executive body -- time to analyze everything and make recommendations to member states, who also have to prepare. But Brexit is no ordinary agenda item.

This month, the EU has blown through one self-imposed deadline after another, as they try to settle the conditions of a UK exit from the union, before heads of government start turning up in Brussels. On Tuesday, they missed another deadline. As things stand now, no one will have time to digest any Brexit deal before the Thursday summit -- which could mean more stale pastries, fries and head-scratching in the middle of the night, instead.

Who said it? Debate edition

""I don't need lessons from you on courage — political or personal.""

""That is dead wrong.""

""It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.""

""The mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.""

""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done.""

""MATH""

What good is a 12-person debate anyway?

Glad you asked.

The US electoral map is so vast that most Americans only see presidential candidates on TV, so these events are necessary for Democratic officials to build enthusiasm among voters, reaching tens of millions of viewers -- and not just Democrats. And the crowded field offers more than a soundbite fest — it fleshes out a broader divide between liberal and moderate positions that grassroots voters must adjudicate before choosing a candidate.

There is something quintessentially American about opening the White House race to everyone. The last two US presidents have been a rookie senator from Illinois and a businessman from New York with almost no political experience between them and little in common. Debates are part of a process that must be sufficiently elastic to accommodate sharp shifts in public opinion over a four year cycle.

In a populist age, party elites fear charges of dictating voters' choices, and the field will narrow soon enough anyway. When it does, the debates will have been good practice for the eventual Democratic nominee, who must debate Donald Trump a year from now. Whether they're the right way to pick a decent president is a whole other ballgame."
