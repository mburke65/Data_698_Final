Another Texas Southern student, Christopher Anwuri, 22, said the generational differences in how black voters saw the primary were fueled by opposing theories of political change: incrementalism versus immediate upheaval.

“This generation is looking for an instant, quick fix for problems,” he said. Older black people, meanwhile, think “these things need to take time.”

It also comes back to Mr. Obama, and the long shadow he casts over national Democratic politics, particularly in black communities. Older black voters invoke his name in deference, and cite his embrace of Mr. Biden as something that helped him win the trust of skeptical white voters in 2008.

To younger generations, many of whom were in high school or younger at the time, Mr. Obama’s achievements exist on their own. Their first memories of Mr. Biden stem from his highly meme-able vice-presidential years. They are also more likely to hold his long and at times controversial record — on criminal justice, school segregation and the Clarence Thomas hearings, among other things — against him.

Jayla Lee, 19, said older black voters “like Biden because he was with Obama, and they feel like since they could trust Obama that means they can trust him.”

“But the things we endure are not the things they endured,” Ms. Lee said. “And I’m looking for someone who can change the things that affect me.”"

Biden Jr., Mr. Biden’s son and other Trump rivals.

The pressure was so relentless that Mr. Zelensky dispatched one of his closest aides to open a line of communication with Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers. Mr. Giuliani was the loudest voice among those demanding that Ukraine look at Mr. Biden’s dealings with the country when he was vice president at the same time his younger son, Hunter Biden, was doing business there, and also the release by Ukrainians in 2016 of damaging information about a top Trump campaign aide.

Over breakfast in early July at the Trump International Hotel, Mr. Zelensky’s aide asked the State Department’s envoy to Ukraine for help connecting to Mr. Giuliani. Several days later, the aide discussed with Mr. Giuliani by phone the prospective investigations as well as something the Ukrainians wanted: a White House meeting between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump.

But if Mr. Zelensky’s goal was to reduce the pressure to pursue the investigations and win more support from the White House — not least for Ukraine’s fight against Russia — he would be disappointed."

Biden Jr.’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation, an apparently blatant mixture of foreign policy with his 2020 re-election campaign.

Mr. Trump also repeatedly told the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, to talk with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had been urging the government in Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden and his family, according to two other people briefed on the call.

Mr. Trump’s request is part of the secret whistle-blower complaint that is said to be about Mr. Trump and at least in part about his dealings with Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the complaint.

Mr. Biden is a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. The president has made no secret that he wanted Ukraine to investigate any improper overlap between Mr. Biden’s own diplomatic efforts there and his son’s role with a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday in response to a question about his call with Mr. Zelensky."

Biden Jr.’s son as little more than a “witch hunt” and said his dealings were “perfectly fine” and routine.

“Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign.

The news reports he was referring to have revealed the existence of a secret whistle-blower complaint that is believed to have been filed, at least partly, in response to Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The New York Times reported Friday that Mr. Trump, in a July call, pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation.

Mr. Trump, intensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, said the real problem was Mr. Biden, who according to most polls is the leading candidate in a crowded Democratic field and has framed himself as the most likely to defeat Mr. Trump in the general election."

Mr. Biden, whose appearances on the campaign trail can be halting and sprinkled with misstatements, has generally delivered his strongest performances when focused on Mr. Trump. Speaking about the president allows Mr. Biden to discuss foreign policy and national security, issues that his campaign has said differentiate Mr. Biden, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, from the rest of the 2020 Democratic field.

While Mr. Trump’s attacks give Mr. Biden the one-on-one showdown with the president that his campaign has spent months trying to create, it also exposes him and his son to another round of questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities in Ukraine.

The Biden campaign moved quickly to warn the news media over the story, underscoring a deep concern about how allegations about the younger Mr. Biden’s work will be received by voters. “Any article, segment analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump’s claim, and in fact that they are wholly discredited, is misleading readers and viewers ,” said the deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in an email to reporters.

But Biden advisers also seized on the furor to portray Mr. Trump as fixated on, and worried about, a potential general election race against Mr. Biden.

“There is only one candidate the president is trying to get foreign governments to dig up bogus dirt on,” Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, said.

The effort by the president and his team to shift the focus to Mr. Biden could boomerang, casting the Democratic front-runner as a sympathetic figure unfairly attacked with foreign help. It could just as easily mark a defining moment for Mr. Biden, a 76-year-old politician first elected to the Senate in 1972 and long accustomed to playing by the more genteel political rules of a different era."

An intelligence official filed a whistle-blower complaint last month about the president’s actions. The inspector general for the intelligence community deemed the complaint “credible” and “urgent” and forwarded it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, under a law that says such complaints must be shown to Congress within a week.

But Mr. Maguire refused to share the complaint with Congress, saying the Justice Department disagreed with the inspector general’s conclusion that its subject matter was covered under the law that requires disclosing such complaints to Congress. The issue came into the open when the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, sent an angry letter to Mr. Maguire on Sept. 10, accusing him of violating the law.

Mr. Maguire relented as the impeachment inquiry came into focus. He was expected to release a redacted version of the complaint in coming days, people familiar with the situation said late on Tuesday. Administration officials were also said to be working on a deal to allow the whistle-blower to file the complaint to congressional investigators.

Mr. Maguire is set to testify about the matter on Thursday.

What did the whistle-blower claim?

The complaint’s full details remain a mystery, as does the whistle-blower’s identity. Because Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have openly acknowledged pressuring Ukraine about “corruption” and the Bidens, it is not clear how much the complaint involves that is not already in plain view.

But in a closed-door briefing with the House Intelligence Committee, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, said that the complaint involved multiple actions, according to two officials familiar with his briefing, suggesting that the matter goes beyond Mr. Trump’s July phone call.

What does Mr. Trump say?

The president insists that he has been unfairly accused, saying — without offering evidence — that the whistle-blower is “partisan” and that Democrats and the news media are initiating a new “witch hunt” against him. Mr. Trump has also said that he is aware that his conversations with foreign leaders are monitored by numerous government officials and that he would not incriminate himself so easily.

What is Mr. Giuliani’s role?

Mr. Giuliani has communicated with Ukrainian officials for months about the Bidens. He has also pressed them about the circumstances of the 2016 disclosures of payments earmarked by a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, who is in federal prison on convictions related to his Ukrainian political work. Mr. Giuliani has sought information about both subjects and traveled to Madrid this summer for a meeting with one of Mr. Zelensky’s top aides, whom he urged to investigate the matters."

Biden Jr. found himself fending off new questions about his decades-long record on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, in a testy exchange with a moderator who described his treatment of her as “condescending.”

During a Friday night forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, Mr. Biden seemed to recoil from the direct questioning from Lyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist.

In a question-and-answer session, Ms. Lenz repeatedly pressed Mr. Biden about his past votes for the Defense of Marriage Act, the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that forbade openly gay people from serving and his statement earlier this year that Vice President Mike Pence, known for his socially conservative positions, was “a decent guy.”

Mr. Biden sought to defend himself, reminding the audience in a steamy auditorium that he supported same-sex marriage before President Obama. “I didn’t have to evolve,” he said."

Whether you like it or not, somehow I’m going to eventually get you to cover it.”

It’s far from clear that Mr. Giuliani’s argument — that a whistle-blower complaint filed by an intelligence official against Mr. Trump will “turn out to be even stupider than Papadopoulos” — will prevail. Mr. Trump, according to multiple sources, pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter, and urged him to work with Mr. Giuliani on such an inquiry. Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have denied discussing the former mayor’s contacts with Ukrainian officials.

Mr. Giuliani described his 28 minutes of cross talk with Mr. Cuomo on Thursday night as “pretty rough.” During the exchange, Mr. Giuliani said he had no idea whether Mr. Trump spoke with the Ukrainian president about Mr. Biden, or Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. But if he did, Mr. Giuliani said, “he had every right to do it.”

“I need a platform to get that out,” he said Friday. “The platform requires them beating me over the head.” If that meant he had to sustain some blows, he said, so be it.

Mr. Giuliani said he was flooded with responses to his interview, calling it his “best appearance on television,” and noting that he “laid out the hypocrisy.”

Mr. Giuliani said that enduring Mr. Cuomo’s aggressive questioning was the price he was willing to pay to give voice to his claims that the Obama White House asked the Ukrainians to “dig up dirt” on Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort.

“I didn’t talk to the president about it before,” he said. “I didn’t talk to him about it after. I won’t tell you if I talked to him about it today, or not.”"

I doubt it. The under-30s, maybe under-40s, are underwhelmed by Biden, even angry that this honorable man has not chosen dignified retirement. He’s the emblem of the permanent political class, the one that created the conditions for Trump, in an era that Trump’s wild policy lurches and heresies and, yes, lies have now transformed.

America’s restoration, after this trauma, will not be achieved by going back. What created Trump cannot oust Trump. It will demand a new politics, and a new integrity, such as the one Warren has set out and embodied with greater vigor, persuasiveness and coherence than anyone else. Biden, on whom Trump may have been seeking dirt in a July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, can put an end to the president’s sullying of the Oval Office. He can’t, however, embody renewal.

Is Warren too far left to win? Maybe. Does she worry some purple-district Democrats who did well in 2018? Yes. But she can adjust. As for “electability,” an overused word, well, Trump won, and may again, so all bets are off.

I said Biden has come close to a blowup moment. The campaign is grueling. You don’t have to be almost 77 to slip up. But he has demonstrated tone-deafness on race in a way that is disturbing.

His reference to a “record player” in the last Democratic debate in the context of a question about reparations for slavery tied Biden to a bygone era, but that was far from the worst of it. Talking about black families — that is what the question was about — he actually said: “We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help. They don’t, they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the, the — — make sure the kids hear words.”

They don’t know what to do! Make sure the kids hear words! This is insulting toward African-Americans. It’s of a piece with Biden’s comment (quickly adjusted) in August that “we have this notion that somehow if you’re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.”

There’s a way, and a need, to talk about fundamental systemic racial injustice, but this is emphatically not it. Black does not equal poor and inept. The genius has left a void. Right now it’s not his vice president who may just fill it enough, but Warren.

Re “Claim on Trump Is Said to Involve a Foreign Leader” (front page, Sept. 20):

Donald Trump has said, “I have the right to do whatever I want as president.” Indeed this is mostly true. The president not only has broad powers but he can even be spared legal consequences as long as he remains in office. This was made painfully clear in the Mueller investigation.

There are, however, red lines. The founding fathers did allow for congressional oversight and action in the event of a bad actor who would use the office of the presidency in service of himself rather than in service of the country. Now there is a whistle-blower in the intelligence community who has urgent information about the president that he believes Congress needs to know. It is information that Mr. Trump and the Justice Department would rather see withheld from Congress.

If speculations are true, and the president himself or through an emissary threatened to withhold vital military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son or pursue a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden himself, that type of quid pro quo would be deeply troubling. It is the definition of politically self-serving.

Lawlessness is rampant in the Trump administration. If we want to restore the rule of law to our republic and faith in our democracy, we must insist that the whistle-blower be permitted to speak, come what may."

To many on the left, Donald Trump is an order of magnitude more disastrous a commander in chief than was George W. Bush, whose reputation now stands thoroughly rehabilitated in the popular culture. Bush is no longer the incurious man who launched an unnecessary war that killed hundreds of thousands in Iraq; today, he’s the goofy old fella who paints portraits of the troops, pals around with Michelle Obama and seems to be in on the joke of our times.

“Sorta makes me look pretty good, doesn’t it?” Bush has been reported to smirk about the Trump era.

For the record, I think the jury is still out on whether Trump is worse than Bush. But for most of 2019, I’ve been trying to picture a future that elevates Trump in the same way it did Bush: How much worse could all t his get? And worse in what direction — what politics, policies, rhetoric and media mastery will the next extremely terrible president marshal to ruin America anew?

In short: What sort of character do we have to imagine occupying the White House in 2029 to make lefties like myself feel even a slight pang of nostalgia for the good old days of Donald J. Trump?

The thought experiment is instructive because it compels us to ponder some of the fundamental forces shaping American culture and politics at the moment. It is also horrifying, because what quickly becomes evident is that we might now be only in the middle of everything spinning out of control."

Mr. Maguire is scheduled to appear before that committee i n an open hearing next week. Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said they expect him and Mr. Atkinson to brief them next week, too.

Maybe there’s not that much to the complaint; we can’t know yet. What we do know is there is an important principle at stake: that Congress is supposed to have oversight — through confidential hearings — of complaints like this. There’s a solid case to be made that Mr. Maguire, who has not invoked executive privilege as a reason for withholding the complaint, is ignoring the plain language of the law. While the lawyers battle over who is authorized to withhold what from whom, it’s worth making two observations: first, that the intelligence community’s watchdog — not some disgruntled denizen of the “deep state,” but a man appointed by Mr. Trump — was alarmed enough that he thought it necessary to inform Congress.

Second, that the administration is doing whatever it can to keep the complaint from becoming known, even behind closed doors.

Mr. Trump mocked the whole episode on Twitter, asking, “Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially ‘heavily populated’ call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!” That’s a curious claim from a president who has gone to great lengths to hide from his own administration the details of his many conversations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia; who has casually revealed Israeli classified intelligence to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the Oval Office; and whose defense secretary decided to quit after learning that Mr. Trump had told the president of Turkey over the phone that he was breaking with longstanding policy and withdrawing American troops from Syria.

Three House committees are investigating whether Mr. Trump tried to get the Ukrainian government to investigate business dealings of the son of the former vice president and current presidential candidate Joseph Biden. They have asked for a transcript of a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine."

Biden Jr., Mr. Biden’s son and other Trump rivals.

The pressure was so relentless that Mr. Zelensky dispatched one of his closest aides to open a line of communication with Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers. Mr. Giuliani was the loudest voice among those demanding that Ukraine look at Mr. Biden’s dealings with the country when he was vice president at the same time his younger son, Hunter Biden, was doing business there, and also the release by Ukrainians in 2016 of damaging information about a top Trump campaign aide.

Over breakfast in early July at the Trump International Hotel, Mr. Zelensky’s aide asked the State Department’s envoy to Ukraine for help connecting to Mr. Giuliani. Several days later, the aide discussed with Mr. Giuliani by phone the prospective investigations as well as something the Ukrainians wanted: a White House meeting between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump.

But if Mr. Zelensky’s goal was to reduce the pressure to pursue the investigations and win more support from the White House — not least for Ukraine’s fight against Russia — he would be disappointed."

Biden Jr.’s son as little more than a “witch hunt” and said his dealings were “perfectly fine” and routine.

“Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign.

The news reports he was referring to have revealed the existence of a secret whistle-blower complaint that is believed to have been filed, at least partly, in response to Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The New York Times reported Friday that Mr. Trump, in a July call, pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation.

The gains by Ms. Warren come largely at the expense of Mr. Sanders. His polling drop-off comes as his campaign has reordered staff in early nominating states in an effort to reboot his campaign.

Senator Kamala Harris of California was fifth overall with 6 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota each had 3 percent support. Four candidates were the first choice of 2 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers.

In addition to leading the field, Ms. Warren also has the most room for growth in the field — 71 percent of Democrats surveyed said she was their first or second choice or they were open to backing her, the poll found. Mr. Biden was next, being considered by 60 percent of Iowa Democrats. Of the rest of the field, only Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris were being considered by more than half the Democratic electorate.

Mr. Biden, whose appearances on the campaign trail can be halting and sprinkled with misstatements, has generally delivered his strongest performances when focused on Mr. Trump. Speaking about the president allows Mr. Biden to discuss foreign policy and national security, issues that his campaign has said differentiate Mr. Biden, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, from the rest of the 2020 Democratic field.

While Mr. Trump’s attacks give Mr. Biden the one-on-one showdown with the president that his campaign has spent months trying to create, it also exposes him and his son to another round of questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities in Ukraine.

The Biden campaign moved quickly to warn the news media over the story, underscoring a deep concern about how allegations about the younger Mr. Biden’s work will be received by voters. “Any article, segment analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump’s claim, and in fact that they are wholly discredited, is misleading readers and viewers ,” said the deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in an email to reporters.

But Biden advisers also seized on the furor to portray Mr. Trump as fixated on, and worried about, a potential general election race against Mr. Biden.

“There is only one candidate the president is trying to get foreign governments to dig up bogus dirt on,” Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, said.

The effort by the president and his team to shift the focus to Mr. Biden could boomerang, casting the Democratic front-runner as a sympathetic figure unfairly attacked with foreign help. It could just as easily mark a defining moment for Mr. Biden, a 76-year-old politician first elected to the Senate in 1972 and long accustomed to playing by the more genteel political rules of a different era."

Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said Congress had to take action. “If we do have the evidence from this whistle-blower that the president indeed did try to bully a foreign power into affecting our elections, then we have to do something about it,” he said on “Meet the Press” on NBC as he called for release of the whistle-blower’s complaint.

Mr. Murphy, who recently visited Ukraine, said Mr. Zelensky expressed consternation to him that the security aid was held up. The senator said administration officials gave him two explanations for holding up the money — that Mr. Trump was concerned about corruption in Ukraine and that he thought Europe should be the one to assist Kiev rather than the United States.

But Mr. Murphy cast doubt on those explanations and said the situation was clearly suspicious. “Obviously, the timing of this looks really terrible,” he said.

While most Republicans remained silent, one prominent senator added his voice to the chorus of concern. “If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,” Senator Mitt Romney of Utah wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “Critical for the facts to come out.”

In Kiev, Mr. Zelensky has not commented on the matter since the issue erupted in news reports in recent days, but Ukraine’s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, was quoted telling a Ukrainian news outlet on Saturday that the country’s leaders did not take Mr. Trump’s phone call as pressure."

An intelligence official filed a whistle-blower complaint last month about the president’s actions. The inspector general for the intelligence community deemed the complaint “credible” and “urgent” and forwarded it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, under a law that says such complaints must be shown to Congress within a week.

But Mr. Maguire refused to share the complaint with Congress, saying the Justice Department disagreed with the inspector general’s conclusion that its subject matter was covered under the law that requires disclosing such complaints to Congress. The issue came into the open when the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, sent an angry letter to Mr. Maguire on Sept. 10, accusing him of violating the law.

Mr. Maguire relented as the impeachment inquiry came into focus. He was expected to release a redacted version of the complaint in coming days, people familiar with the situation said late on Tuesday. Administration officials were also said to be working on a deal to allow the whistle-blower to file the complaint to congressional investigators.

Mr. Maguire is set to testify about the matter on Thursday.

What did the whistle-blower claim?

The complaint’s full details remain a mystery, as does the whistle-blower’s identity. Because Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have openly acknowledged pressuring Ukraine about “corruption” and the Bidens, it is not clear how much the complaint involves that is not already in plain view.

But in a closed-door briefing with the House Intelligence Committee, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, said that the complaint involved multiple actions, according to two officials familiar with his briefing, suggesting that the matter goes beyond Mr. Trump’s July phone call.

What does Mr. Trump say?

The president insists that he has been unfairly accused, saying — without offering evidence — that the whistle-blower is “partisan” and that Democrats and the news media are initiating a new “witch hunt” against him. Mr. Trump has also said that he is aware that his conversations with foreign leaders are monitored by numerous government officials and that he would not incriminate himself so easily.

What is Mr. Giuliani’s role?

Mr. Giuliani has communicated with Ukrainian officials for months about the Bidens. He has also pressed them about the circumstances of the 2016 disclosures of payments earmarked by a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, who is in federal prison on convictions related to his Ukrainian political work. Mr. Giuliani has sought information about both subjects and traveled to Madrid this summer for a meeting with one of Mr. Zelensky’s top aides, whom he urged to investigate the matters."

During a Friday night forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, Mr. Biden seemed to recoil from the direct questioning from Lyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist.

In a question-and-answer session, Ms. Lenz repeatedly pressed Mr. Biden about his past votes for the Defense of Marriage Act, the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that forbade openly gay people from serving and his statement earlier this year that Vice President Mike Pence, known for his socially conservative positions, was “a decent guy.”

Mr. Biden sought to defend himself, reminding the audience in a steamy auditorium that he supported same-sex marriage before President Obama. “I didn’t have to evolve,” he said."

I doubt it. The under-30s, maybe under-40s, are underwhelmed by Biden, even angry that this honorable man has not chosen dignified retirement. He’s the emblem of the permanent political class, the one that created the conditions for Trump, in an era that Trump’s wild policy lurches and heresies and, yes, lies have now transformed.

America’s restoration, after this trauma, will not be achieved by going back. What created Trump cannot oust Trump. It will demand a new politics, and a new integrity, such as the one Warren has set out and embodied with greater vigor, persuasiveness and coherence than anyone else. Biden, on whom Trump may have been seeking dirt in a July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, can put an end to the president’s sullying of the Oval Office. He can’t, however, embody renewal.

Is Warren too far left to win? Maybe. Does she worry some purple-district Democrats who did well in 2018? Yes. But she can adjust. As for “electability,” an overused word, well, Trump won, and may again, so all bets are off.

I said Biden has come close to a blowup moment. The campaign is grueling. You don’t have to be almost 77 to slip up. But he has demonstrated tone-deafness on race in a way that is disturbing.

His reference to a “record player” in the last Democratic debate in the context of a question about reparations for slavery tied Biden to a bygone era, but that was far from the worst of it. Talking about black families — that is what the question was about — he actually said: “We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help. They don’t, they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the, the — — make sure the kids hear words.”

They don’t know what to do! Make sure the kids hear words! This is insulting toward African-Americans. It’s of a piece with Biden’s comment (quickly adjusted) in August that “we have this notion that somehow if you’re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.”

There’s a way, and a need, to talk about fundamental systemic racial injustice, but this is emphatically not it. Black does not equal poor and inept. The genius has left a void. Right now it’s not his vice president who may just fill it enough, but Warren.

“You could be No. 6,” Ms. Klobuchar said before the poll results were announced. “I’m really serious, in a 20-person field and people will go, ‘Not bad.’ They’re going to look at who is in the top eight.”

Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa.

To many on the left, Donald Trump is an order of magnitude more disastrous a commander in chief than was George W. Bush, whose reputation now stands thoroughly rehabilitated in the popular culture. Bush is no longer the incurious man who launched an unnecessary war that killed hundreds of thousands in Iraq; today, he’s the goofy old fella who paints portraits of the troops, pals around with Michelle Obama and seems to be in on the joke of our times.

“Sorta makes me look pretty good, doesn’t it?” Bush has been reported to smirk about the Trump era.

For the record, I think the jury is still out on whether Trump is worse than Bush. But for most of 2019, I’ve been trying to picture a future that elevates Trump in the same way it did Bush: How much worse could all t his get? And worse in what direction — what politics, policies, rhetoric and media mastery will the next extremely terrible president marshal to ruin America anew?

In short: What sort of character do we have to imagine occupying the White House in 2029 to make lefties like myself feel even a slight pang of nostalgia for the good old days of Donald J. Trump?

The thought experiment is instructive because it compels us to ponder some of the fundamental forces shaping American culture and politics at the moment. It is also horrifying, because what quickly becomes evident is that we might now be only in the middle of everything spinning out of control."

He had 14 percent in The Register’s June poll and has fallen in other surveys of the state since then before launching a television advertising campaign here after Labor Day.

The gains by Ms. Warren come largely at the expense of Mr. Sanders. His polling drop-off comes as his campaign has reordered staff in early nominating states in an effort to reboot his campaign.

Senator Kamala Harris of California was fifth overall with 6 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota each had 3 percent support. Four candidates were the first choice of 2 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers.

In addition to leading the field, Ms. Warren also has the most room for growth in the field — 71 percent of Democrats surveyed said she was their first or second choice or they were open to backing her, the poll found. Mr. Biden was next, being considered by 60 percent of Iowa Democrats. Of the rest of the field, only Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris were being considered by more than half the Democratic electorate.

The dynamics are far from set: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, and 63 percent said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate."

Even for a leader who has audaciously disregarded many of the boundaries that restrained his predecessors, President Trump’s appeal to a foreign power for dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is an astonishing breach of the norms governing the American presidency.

That his phone call with Ukraine’s leader took place literally the day after the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III testified to Congress about Russian interference in the 2016 election demonstrated that Mr. Trump took no lessons from that episode about the perils and propriety of mixing his own political interests with international relations.

If anything, the president has grown even more defiant since Mr. Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, almost as if having avoided charges, he is daring the establishment to come after him again. The man who once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan without consequence seems to be testing whether he can do the political equivalent."

Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said Congress had to take action. “If we do have the evidence from this whistle-blower that the president indeed did try to bully a foreign power into affecting our elections, then we have to do something about it,” he said on “Meet the Press” on NBC as he called for release of the whistle-blower’s complaint.

Mr. Murphy, who recently visited Ukraine, said Mr. Zelensky expressed consternation to him that the security aid was held up. The senator said administration officials gave him two explanations for holding up the money — that Mr. Trump was concerned about corruption in Ukraine and that he thought Europe should be the one to assist Kiev rather than the United States.

But Mr. Murphy cast doubt on those explanations and said the situation was clearly suspicious. “Obviously, the timing of this looks really terrible,” he said.

While most Republicans remained silent, one prominent senator added his voice to the chorus of concern. “If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,” Senator Mitt Romney of Utah wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “Critical for the facts to come out.”

In Kiev, Mr. Zelensky has not commented on the matter since the issue erupted in news reports in recent days, but Ukraine’s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, was quoted telling a Ukrainian news outlet on Saturday that the country’s leaders did not take Mr. Trump’s phone call as pressure."

His audience sizes often number just in the double-digits, which could be viewed as a comedown compared to the thousands that were thronging Mr. O’Rourke during his Senate race last year — including one September rally in Austin featuring Willie Nelson that drew upward of 50,000 people. Did he find this contrast deflating, a reporter asked Mr. O’Rourke after a low-key rally at Keene State College in New Hampshire?

“Oh, I’m really grateful to anyone who would forgo a perfectly fine movie or dinner date to spend some time on a Friday night with a candidate for the presidency,” Mr. O’Rourke replied, offering perhaps the only possible answer a politician could give (what candidate would admit to being “deflated?”).

Mr. O’Rourke still manages to project earnestness with his entire body. He keeps casually dropping in his now-signature profanity because, he explained, being polite and restrained “doesn’t always express the anger o r the urgency that I feel.”

His zigzagging trajectory over the last year can be ordered into pronounced phases. Last fall — the peak of his Beto-Mania Phase — ended in a narrow loss to Mr. Cruz. Nevertheless, the hype persisted. “We did not see that coming,” Mr. O’Rourke said of the continued attention, which ushered in a new phase.

Late on election night, a couple of supporters wandered into Mr. O’Rourke’s El Paso home to commiserate. “They were just these drunk dudes in their teens who were bummed out and decided to come to Beto’s house,” Mr. O’Rourke recalled. “They just walked in and were like ‘Hey dude, we’re just so sorry you lost, can I get a selfie with you?’”

“And I was like, ‘Sure, but you can’t just walk into someone’s house like this.’ And they were like ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’”

Mr. O’Rourke nursed his defeat, set out on a road trip and went to the dentist, live-streaming as he went. He decided to run for president. From the outset, the enterprise seemed to lack definition. He was outshone and overtaken in a crowded field of movement progressives (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren), an established elder (Joe Biden) and new faces (Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris) who seemed brighter than last year’s meteor. He came off shaky and overwhelmed in the first two debates. Beto-mania 2018 seemed far away."

Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa.

Re “Trump Admits He Spoke to Ukraine About Biden” (front page, Sept. 23):

The Democrats have reached the proverbial fork in the road. If they choose the path of impeachment of the president, even if they fail in the Senate, they can hold their heads high, as the defenders of the Constitution and a party of values. If they choose to continue to go down the no-impeachment path, they will be known as enablers, who just like their Republican colleagues turned the other way to give free rein to President Trump’s actions.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far shied away from impeachment, a political strategy aimed at not hurting her party’s chances in the 2020 elections. But there comes a time when political strategy must be superseded by principles. The Democrats must ask themselves: “If not us, who? If not now, when?” The time is now.

Did Hunter Biden do anything wrong?

Hunter Biden has not been accused of legal wrongdoing related to his work for Burisma, which paid him as much as $50,000 per month in some months for his service on the board of the directors. He said in a statement this year that he never discussed Burisma with his father.

But he has been criticized by government watchdog groups in the United States and Ukraine for what they characterize as the perception of a conflict of interest, and trading on his family name by allowing it to be used to burnish the reputations of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky.

Starting in 2012, Mr. Zlochevsky has faced a long series of accusations of money laundering and tax evasion, as well as overseeing the awarding of lucrative gas licenses to his companies while he was the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources under the Russia-aligned government of the former president Viktor F. Yanukovych.

When Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, he had no experience in Ukraine. He has a professional history including a number of roles that intersected with his father’s political career. When his father represented Delaware in the Senate, Hunter Biden worked with a credit card issuer in the state. He also worked at the Commerce Department under President Bill Clinton and as a lobbyist on behalf of various universities, associations and companies.

Did Joe Biden’s push to remove the prosecutor help Hunter Biden’s employer?

Mr. Zlochevsky’s allies were relieved by the dismissal of Mr. Shokin, the prosecutor whose ouster Mr. Biden had sought, according to people familiar with the situation.

Mr. Shokin was not aggressively pursuing investigations into Mr. Zlochevsky or Burisma. But the oligarch’s allies say Mr. Shokin was using the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes from Mr. Zlochevsky and his team, and that left the oligarch’s team leery of dealing with the prosecutor."

Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign.

At issue is not whether Mr. Trump spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart about Mr. Biden or even whether he accused Mr. Biden of corruption. The president acknowledged as much on Sunday, when he told reporters, “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

This jibes with what Mr. Giuliani said — far more combatively — in a Thursday interview on CNN. Pressed on whether he had asked Ukrainian officials to look into Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani initially said no, then, upon further questioning, declared, “Of course I did!”

Whatever the nature and impetus for Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani’s pressure campaign, it came at a delicate moment in relations between the United States and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. This summer the Trump administration, without any warning, temporarily held up $250 million in military aid aimed at helping Ukraine defend itself against aggression by Russia. At the time, the administration said it was reviewing the program to make sure the money was being used in the best interest of the United States. The money was released this month, the same week that three House committees announced plans to look into whether Mr. Trump had pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival and whether his administration had suggested, explicitly or implicitly, that the aid money was contingent on that help.

This is a complicated situation, and there are serious questions begging to be cleared up. The White House has worked to prevent that from happening. By refusing to turn over the whistle-blower report, the administration is following the same playbook it has used for all of Congress’s inquiries: deny, deflect and delay — possibly indefinitely."

Even for a leader who has audaciously disregarded many of the boundaries that restrained his predecessors, President Trump’s appeal to a foreign power for dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is an astonishing breach of the norms governing the American presidency.

That his phone call with Ukraine’s leader took place literally the day after the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III testified to Congress about Russian interference in the 2016 election demonstrated that Mr. Trump took no lessons from that episode about the perils and propriety of mixing his own political interests with international relations.

If anything, the president has grown even more defiant since Mr. Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, almost as if having avoided charges, he is daring the establishment to come after him again. The man who once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan without consequence seems to be testing whether he can do the political equivalent."

His audience sizes often number just in the double-digits, which could be viewed as a comedown compared to the thousands that were thronging Mr. O’Rourke during his Senate race last year — including one September rally in Austin featuring Willie Nelson that drew upward of 50,000 people. Did he find this contrast deflating, a reporter asked Mr. O’Rourke after a low-key rally at Keene State College in New Hampshire?

“Oh, I’m really grateful to anyone who would forgo a perfectly fine movie or dinner date to spend some time on a Friday night with a candidate for the presidency,” Mr. O’Rourke replied, offering perhaps the only possible answer a politician could give (what candidate would admit to being “deflated?”).

Mr. O’Rourke still manages to project earnestness with his entire body. He keeps casually dropping in his now-signature profanity because, he explained, being polite and restrained “doesn’t always express the anger o r the urgency that I feel.”

His zigzagging trajectory over the last year can be ordered into pronounced phases. Last fall — the peak of his Beto-Mania Phase — ended in a narrow loss to Mr. Cruz. Nevertheless, the hype persisted. “We did not see that coming,” Mr. O’Rourke said of the continued attention, which ushered in a new phase.

Late on election night, a couple of supporters wandered into Mr. O’Rourke’s El Paso home to commiserate. “They were just these drunk dudes in their teens who were bummed out and decided to come to Beto’s house,” Mr. O’Rourke recalled. “They just walked in and were like ‘Hey dude, we’re just so sorry you lost, can I get a selfie with you?’”

“And I was like, ‘Sure, but you can’t just walk into someone’s house like this.’ And they were like ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’”

Mr. O’Rourke nursed his defeat, set out on a road trip and went to the dentist, live-streaming as he went. He decided to run for president. From the outset, the enterprise seemed to lack definition. He was outshone and overtaken in a crowded field of movement progressives (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren), an established elder (Joe Biden) and new faces (Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris) who seemed brighter than last year’s meteor. He came off shaky and overwhelmed in the first two debates. Beto-mania 2018 seemed far away."

The $391 million aid package in question was provided to Ukraine for its defense against a Russian-backed separatist insurgency in its east which has left more than 13,000 people dead over the past five years.

Mr. Trump also noted that the funds allocated for Ukraine “were fully paid,” although he did not mention the fact that his administration acted only after the delay became public through news media leaks, and under bipartisan pressure from Congress.

He also did not mention that he had changed his explanation for withholding the money from just a day before. On Monday, he linked his decision to block the aid to his concerns about corruption in Ukraine, citing Mr. Biden as an example. By emphasizing instead his overall concern about foreign aid, he was advancing a rationale less tied to his demand for an investigation.

Mr. Trump earlier repeated his assertion that the transcript would exonerate him.

“When you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you’ll see at some point, you’ll understand that call was perfect,” he said.

In a brief interview with Voice of America’s Ukrainian outlet, Mr. Zelensky said he expected continued support from the United States and predicted that a meeting he is scheduled to have with Mr. Trump at the United Nations on Wednesday would “be very warm.”

“We just want the U.S. to always support Ukraine and Ukraine’s course in its fight against aggression and war,” Mr. Zelensky said at the United Nations. “It seems to me that it is so. And everything seems to lead to this.”"

Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, said Tuesday that he would work with Congress and the administration to find a resolution in the standoff over congressional access to the complaint.

In a sharply worded statement, Mr. Maguire pushed back on an assertion by Ms. Pelosi that he had acted illegally by withholding the whistle-blower complaint from Congress.

“In light of recent reporting on the whistle-blower complaint, I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,” Mr. Maguire said.

Democrats Cite the Clarity of the Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-inquiry.html,"The initiation of a formal impeachment inquiry carries grave political risks for Democrats, allowing Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans to argue that Democrats are unfairly tormenting the president for partisan gain with an election just more than a year away. “PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!” Mr. Trump tweeted from New York, where he was attending meetings at the United Nations, as Democrats announced that they were opening a formal impeachment inquiry.

Among the main questions for Democrats is how unified they are now on an issue that has created deep rifts within their ranks until this week. It is far from clear, for instance, whether they agree on how broad the impeachment inquiry should be, or who should run it. Already on Tuesday, some more moderate lawmakers from Republican-leaning districts, who put themselves at political risk to embrace impeachment, were privately voicing frustration at the lack of certainty about what the inquiry would look like going forward.

Republicans paid a steep political price in the midterm elections for moving to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998, and some analysts believe this episode could backfire on Democrats as well.

But with the party clamor growing for action against the president after the Ukrainian revelations, Ms. Pelosi and others who had been holding back faced the prospect that failing to move forward on demands to hold the president accountable could cost them more with their own party than pursuing impeachment might hurt them with Republicans and independents. Long a progressive hero, Ms. Pelosi had already drawn fire from the left for failing to act.

Even as momentum rapidly built, worries surfaced among Democrats that the drive could fizzle with the release of a transcript of the telephone call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president if it proved less explosive than anticipated — an outcome Republicans predicted. But the speaker and others said that such an outcome would not deter them and that they wanted to hear all of the whistle-blower’s account of what led to the complaint against Mr. Trump, which is believed to include more than the call.

The decision to back the inquiry was not easy for Democrats who had been hesitant to get on board.

“I certainly didn’t run for Congress to be part of an impeachment inquiry,” said Representative Haley Stevens, Democrat of Michigan, who called the phone call an abuse of power. “It’s heartbreaking to look something like impeachment in the face,” she added. “No matter who the president is, we want them to succeed. At the same time, I have to maintain the rule of law and checks and balances.”

While the revelation of the whistle-blower complaint broke the logjam on impeachment, Democrats were becoming increasingly incensed at the proud defiance of the House by the president and his allies, essentially thumbing their noses at a coequal branch of government empowered to oversee the conduct of the administration. The Trump strategy had been effective as recently as a few days ago, when Democrats seemed stymied in their pursuit of the president with the prospect of a formal impeachment inquiry flagging."

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.

Only 11 days have passed since Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, revealed that the Trump administration was illegally withholding a whistle-blower complaint from Congress. When the news came out, I — probably like most observers — expected it to be another fizzle, yet another clear example of Trump malfeasance that would just fail to catch fire with Congress or the public.

And that may yet happen. I presume and hope that pollsters are at work as we speak, trying to gauge public opinion on the scandal. But this time feels different, maybe because it’s so simple and clear cut. The president of the United States and his personal lawyer both admit that they called on a foreign regime to produce dirt on one of his political rivals. It now looks as if he tried to pressure said foreign regime by withholding crucial military aid, which makes it worse.

The result is that this scandal is blowing up in a way previous Trump scandals, no matter how serious, haven’t. A House vote to impeach has quickly gone from “unlikely” to “more likely than not” now that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce a formal impeachment inquiry.

Why does this matter? In general, I dislike the common journalistic trope of “winners and losers” from political developments. In this case, however, it seems to me like a good way to sum up the fallout so far. So here are three winners and two losers from the developments so far."

Re “Trump Admits He Spoke to Ukraine About Biden” (front page, Sept. 23):

The Democrats have reached the proverbial fork in the road. If they choose the path of impeachment of the president, even if they fail in the Senate, they can hold their heads high, as the defenders of the Constitution and a party of values. If they choose to continue to go down the no-impeachment path, they will be known as enablers, who just like their Republican colleagues turned the other way to give free rein to President Trump’s actions.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far shied away from impeachment, a political strategy aimed at not hurting her party’s chances in the 2020 elections. But there comes a time when political strategy must be superseded by principles. The Democrats must ask themselves: “If not us, who? If not now, when?” The time is now.

Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Did Hunter Biden do anything wrong?

Hunter Biden has not been accused of legal wrongdoing related to his work for Burisma, which paid him as much as $50,000 per month in some months for his service on the board of the directors. He said in a statement this year that he never discussed Burisma with his father.

But he has been criticized by government watchdog groups in the United States and Ukraine for what they characterize as the perception of a conflict of interest, and trading on his family name by allowing it to be used to burnish the reputations of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky.

Starting in 2012, Mr. Zlochevsky has faced a long series of accusations of money laundering and tax evasion, as well as overseeing the awarding of lucrative gas licenses to his companies while he was the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources under the Russia-aligned government of the former president Viktor F. Yanukovych.

When Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, he had no experience in Ukraine. He has a professional history including a number of roles that intersected with his father’s political career. When his father represented Delaware in the Senate, Hunter Biden worked with a credit card issuer in the state. He also worked at the Commerce Department under President Bill Clinton and as a lobbyist on behalf of various universities, associations and companies.

Did Joe Biden’s push to remove the prosecutor help Hunter Biden’s employer?

Mr. Zlochevsky’s allies were relieved by the dismissal of Mr. Shokin, the prosecutor whose ouster Mr. Biden had sought, according to people familiar with the situation.

Mr. Shokin was not aggressively pursuing investigations into Mr. Zlochevsky or Burisma. But the oligarch’s allies say Mr. Shokin was using the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes from Mr. Zlochevsky and his team, and that left the oligarch’s team leery of dealing with the prosecutor."

It Could Hurt the Presidency.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/opinion/ukraine-trump.html,"Congressional interference into presidential conversations with foreign leaders would violate Article II. According to Mr. Trump’s critics, the inspector general for the intelligence community can forward any whistle-blower complaint to Congress if it involves a matter of “urgent concern.”

But Congress cannot subject the president to the supervision, control or review of a subordinate officer. As the Supreme Court made clear in a 1926 case, all executive branch officials exist to assist the president in the performance of his constitutional duties. An intelligence officer cannot file a whistle-blower complaint against the president, because the president is not a member of the intelligence community; nor does a presidential phone call with a foreign leader qualify as an intelligence operation. The intelligence community works for the president, not the other way around.

Under the Constitution and long practice, the president alone conducts foreign relations. As Justice George Sutherland wrote for the majority in a 1936 Supreme Court opinion (quoting Chief Justice John Marshall), the president “is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations.”

Beginning with George Washington’s 1796 refusal to provide the House with the Jay Treaty negotiating record, presidents have claimed the right not just to communicate with foreign leaders but also to keep national security information secret. Thomas Jefferson even expanded executive privilege to protect national security information against the courts in 1807, when he refused to testify in the treason trial of Aaron Burr (Chief Justice Marshall, presiding as trial judge, accepted Jefferson’s claim).

Here, good constitutional structure matches good policy. If Congress could regulate presidential discussions with foreign leaders, presidents and foreign leaders would speak less candidly or stop making the calls altogether. United States foreign policy — approved by the American people at each election — would be crippled.

Congress would seize the upper hand in foreign affairs, which has produced disasters such as the War of 1812 and restrictions on aid to the Allies before American entry into World War II. In the 1970s, congressional interference after Watergate handicapped the efforts of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter to respond to the Soviet military buildup, Communist expansion in Latin America and Africa, the fall of Vietnam and Iran’s revolution. Only with Ronald Reagan’s restoration of executive power could the United States carry out the strategy that ultimately won the Cold War.

Democrats may regret again wounding the presidency when Mr. Trump’s successors grapple with the rise of China as a global power, Russia’s revanchism, Iran’s quest for regional hegemony and North Korea’s nuclear proliferation."

Here's How Those Plans Would Work (or Not). - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/24/business/economy/wealth-tax-rich.html,"Among Democratic presidential candidates, it’s the rallying cry of the moment — tax the rich. The idea is a centerpiece of the campaigns of Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. A former candidate, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, went so far as to say the government ought to “tax the hell out of the wealthy.”

The new taxes would fund a laundry list of liberal proposals — “Medicare for all,” free college, combating global warming and rebuilding roads and bridges.

But these measures will face fierce opposition, including from wealthy donors. Republicans in Congress are sure to oppose new taxes, making passage impossible unless Democrats take both houses of Congress in 2020. Whatever their political fate, these proposals represent the broadest rethinking of tax policy in decades.

“We seem to go back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on taxing the rich, depending on who is in power,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. “But the Democrats now are a good deal more aggressive than they’ve been in the past.”

Four ideas have gained the most traction: a tax on wealth, raising marginal tax rates, expanding the estate tax and changing how the government taxes capital gains.

Creating a Wealth Tax

How many people would pay? Relatively few. Would it reduce inequality? Almost certainly. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Probably.

In January, Ms. Warren took a bold new approach by proposing to tax wealth, not just income. Her proposal would impose a 2 percent tax on assets above $50 million, or the top 70,000 families by wealth, in a nation of nearly 330 million people. Someone with $100 million in assets would pay $1 million a year. Fortunes over $1 billion would be subject to an additional 1 percent surcharge.

The tax, akin to how property taxes work, would be aimed at a group that controls a growing portion of the nation’s wealth. The 400 richest Americans own 3.5 percent of the country’s assets, according to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists at the University of California, Berkeley, who have advised Ms. Warren. Over time, her tax would reduce that to 2 percent, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. If it had been in place since 1982, the fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, would now be $87 billion, rather than $160 billion, they estimate, using figures from before his divorce.

Ms. Warren’s proposal would bring in $2.6 trillion over 10 years, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. At $260 billion a year, that is a small share of total annual federal spending of $4.4 trillion. Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Natasha Sarin, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, have disputed earlier estimates by the two economists as overly optimistic.

On Tuesday Mr. Sanders is proposing his own wealth tax, one that goes after mega-wealth even more aggressively than Ms. Warren’s proposal. His graduated tax would start at 1 percent for assets of more than $32 million, climbing to 8 percent for wealth exceeding $10 billion. The tax would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over a decade.

As appealing as a wealth tax might sound for the party’s liberal base, enacting it would pose major challenges. Anyone lucky enough to be in its sights has access to top tax lawyers and accountants who can sift through the tax code for a way out, or at least a means of minimizing the hit.

European countries have had mixed success with wealth taxes. Weak enforcement and offshore havens have enabled many individuals to greatly reduce what they owe. The Internal Revenue Service would need detailed reports from banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions to make the tax effective.

“It could raise a lot of money but probably less than Elizabeth Warren thinks,” Mr. Toder said.

Raising top income tax rates

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? Probably. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Yes.

Raising the top income tax rate is one of the most straightforward ways to tax the rich and some prominent Democrats have embraced it. For example, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City has said that the government should impose a 70 percent tax on earnings above $10 million.

While that might sound radical, it would actually represent a return to tax policies that prevailed for decades. The top income tax rate stood at 70 percent as recently as 1980, and was even higher before then, topping 90 percent in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Highest marginal tax rate 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 ’18 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’18 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’18 Source: Tax Policy Center

In terms of inequality, it would effectively reduce some of the extremes in pay that have developed in recent decades. The vast fortunes accumulated by a few dozen billionaires have also made new taxes more politically palatable. For example, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s 70 percent tax would be paid by about 21,000 taxpayers.

Over 10 years, her proposal would raise up to $382 billion, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. That is about half as much as the government will spend on the Defense Department this fiscal year.

With the help of accountants and lawyers, the wealthy would no doubt try to find ways to convert earned income into capital gains or business income, which are currently taxed at lower rates.

Raising the estate tax

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? A lot. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Most likely.

Experts say inherited wealth is an important driver of inequality. The estate tax is meant to combat that, but in recent decades lawmakers have made it easier for taxpayers to avoid it. Mr. Sanders wants to change that.

Under his proposal, the estate tax rate would begin at 45 percent for assets worth more than $3.5 million and rise to 77 percent for those with more than $1 billion. The proposal would apply to just 0.2 percent of the population, according to Mr. Sanders.

The senator’s plan would raise $315 billion over 10 years, or less than half of military spending this year. But the higher tax on estates worth more than $1 billion could raise $2.2 trillion over the long term. Mr. Sanders has said he wants the money to pay for his ambitious agenda of social programs.

Source: Tax Policy Center

Ms. Warren has also proposed expanding the estate tax as part of a housing bill. The estate tax would start at 55 percent and rise to 75 percent. She has said that the tax would affect 14,000 wealthy families a year.

Lawyers and accountants have devised many strategies for avoiding the estate tax, said Kyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the Tax Foundation. Of course, if Congress were to adopt Mr. Sanders’s proposal, lawmakers could also try to close some of those loopholes.

Raising capital gains tax rates

How many people would pay? Relatively few taxpayers. Would it reduce inequality? Most likely. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Possibly.

Several Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, want to end the discrepancy between how different kinds of income are taxed. To wit, long-term capital gains are taxed at a top rate of 20 percent, but the top rate for salary and wage income is 37 percent.

Lower taxes on investment income skew the system in favor of wealthier households and raising capital gains tax rates would change that.

As of 2016, about 80 percent of the income of households that earn less than $198,000 a year comes in the form of wages and salaries, according to a paper by Lily Batchelder and David Kamin of the New York University School of Law. By contrast, capital gains and dividends account for 70 percent of the income of the families that earn $53 million or more a year.

“The way that the very top of earners in our country make money is very different from the rest,” Mr. Kamin said.

Sources of income by income group 2016 BOTTOM 95 PERCENT Wages/salaries 80% Business income 4% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 3% Other 13% TOP .001 PERCENT Wages/salaries 10% Business income 13% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 71% Other 6% 2016 BOTTOM 95 PERCENT Wages/salaries 80% Business income 4% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 3% Other 13% TOP .001 PERCENT Wages/salaries 10% Business income 13% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 71% Other 6% 2016 BOTTOM 95 PERCENT Wages/salaries 80% Business income 4% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 3% Other 13% TOP .001 PERCENT Wages/salaries 10% Business income 13% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 71% Other 6% Source: Lily Batchelder and David Kamin, New York University School of Law

The top 10 percent of households by income own 84 percent of all stocks. Mr. Biden’s plan is aimed at this group and would raise the capital gains rate to 39.6 percent for top earners.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who is not running for president, would go further still by fundamentally changing how capital gains are taxed, at least for the wealthiest Americans. He recently proposed taxing the appreciation of stocks held by the richest 0.3 percent of households, even if those gains haven’t been realized. Mr. Wyden also favors equalizing the rate at which earned income and capital gains are taxed.

The senator’s proposal would have the effect of trimming the wings of billionaires who have watched their fortunes soar but haven’t sold their shares.

The proposal from Mr. Wyden would raise an estimated $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion over 10 years, which would be earmarked for Social Security. Mr. Biden would allocate money raised in part from hiking capital gains taxes to pay the $750 billion cost of expanding coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Simply raising capital gains taxes without other reforms is tricky as taxpayers could choose not to sell stocks to avoid owing money. Based on research it has analyzed, the Tax Policy Center estimates that raising the capital gains rate above 30 percent would reduce revenues, Mr. Toder said. Taxing appreciation as Mr. Wyden has proposed would help address this."

Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign.

In a July phone call with the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Trump is said to have repeatedly urged Mr. Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, on a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden, focused on the tenure of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter on the board of a Ukranian gas company.

At issue is not whether Mr. Trump spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart about Mr. Biden or even whether he accused Mr. Biden of corruption. The president acknowledged as much on Sunday, when he told reporters, “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

This jibes with what Mr. Giuliani said — far more combatively — in a Thursday interview on CNN. Pressed on whether he had asked Ukrainian officials to look into Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani initially said no, then, upon further questioning, declared, “Of course I did!”

Whatever the nature and impetus for Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani’s pressure campaign, it came at a delicate moment in relations between the United States and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. This summer the Trump administration, without any warning, temporarily held up $250 million in military aid aimed at helping Ukraine defend itself against aggression by Russia. At the time, the administration said it was reviewing the program to make sure the money was being used in the best interest of the United States. The money was released this month, the same week that three House committees announced plans to look into whether Mr. Trump had pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival and whether his administration had suggested, explicitly or implicitly, that the aid money was contingent on that help.

This is a complicated situation, and there are serious questions begging to be cleared up. The White House has worked to prevent that from happening. By refusing to turn over the whistle-blower report, the administration is following the same playbook it has used for all of Congress’s inquiries: deny, deflect and delay — possibly indefinitely."

We want to make sure that country is honest,” Trump said. “If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

There’s no mystery here. Trump doesn’t care about corruption — he runs a network of clubs and hotels where interested parties can spend huge sums and curry favor with the administration — but he is worried about Biden’s popularity with Democrats and the wider public. The former vice president leads in nearly every head-to-head matchup with Trump. If the election were held today and Biden were the nominee, Trump would likely lose by double digits.

But if Trump can make 2020 another race between two unpopular nominees — if he can sully his opponent and make him another creature of “the swamp” — then he has a shot at victory. Imagine a world where the Ukrainian government enters the election on behalf of Trump. The president can now do to Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton in 2016 — mire him in enough scandal and innuendo to undermine the vice president’s claim to honesty. “Crooked Hillary” seamlessly becomes “Crooked Joe.” And Biden is vulnerable. He has spent his entire adult life working in Washington, and there’s little question that his son is involved in the kinds of buck-raking and influence peddling that alienates voters and makes them cynical about politics.

As for the other parts of Trump’s unusual 2016 victory, there isn’t — as far as we know — an F.B.I. investigation of Biden or any other Democratic candidate. But Attorney General William Barr has already shown his willingness to use the law in Trump’s favor, and Trump brought him up in his call with Zelensky. It was Barr, of course, whose misleading summary of the Mueller report initially defused criticism and stymied efforts to hold the president accountable for his attempts to obstruct justice.

Given this commitment to the president’s political interests, it’s not hard to imagine how Barr might use “revelations” from the Ukrainian government to pursue an inquiry into the former vice president and his son, releasing information at a pace that feeds the story, strengthens the appearance of impropriety and ultimately undermines Biden’s campaign. Trump, at least, thinks the attorney general is up to the task. In Trump’s conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Trump referred him to Barr . “There is a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that,” the president said to Zelensky, according to a recently released reconstructed transcript. “So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.” The attorney general of the United States, that is."

A few hours later, when coverage of President Trump’s phone call to Ukraine’s president about Mr. Biden and his son had reached a fever pitch, the Biden campaign emailed the news media to declare — in bold underlined words — that any story would be “misleading” if it did not state upfront that Mr. Trump’s claims were unsubstantiated.

On Sunday night, the Biden campaign released a fund-raising appeal on Twitter asking, “Will media see through Trump’s sleazy playbook ? Or fall for it again?” And by Tuesday, the drumbeat of warnings to the press had grown so intense that even Lanny Davis , a longtime Democratic operative, weighed in, attacking “innuendo journalism.”

For the past three years, every Democratic campaign, politician and activist has operated in the shadow of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss, caught in a cycle of self-recrimination and soul-searching about how to defend themselves against Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in 2020. It’s a conversation that began in the hours after Mrs. Clinton’s unexpected loss, as aides reckoned with their inability to defend her from Mr. Trump’s conspiratorial accusations, and has continued ever since, with Mrs. Clinton herself dispensing advice in private conversations with Democratic primary candidates as they prepared to begin their campaigns."

Although there was no explicit quid pro quo in the conversation, Mr. Trump raised the matter immediately after Mr. Zelensky spoke of his country’s need for more help from the United States.

Others might have assumed that the case for impeachment was not strong, given that the party’s elected officials have generally not supported it. They might see it differently now that support from congressional Democrats is all but unanimous.

Alone, these Democratic-leaning voters could move the polls to something close to majority support for impeachment. At best for Democrats, perhaps these voters by themselves could bring the polls to something near where they were in the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, when a slight majority of voters opposed his confirmation.

It is also possible that these easy Democratic targets would leave impeachment well short of majority support. So long as that’s true, there may be some political upside for Republicans.

Whether Democrats can move support higher will probably depend on the allegations themselves. Most voters probably have a very high threshold for supporting impeachment and removal from office, as was the case for President Bill Clinton in 1998. They might think it requires conclusive evidence of criminal activity. Even that may be insufficient.

It is hard to know whether the Ukraine allegations will cross the threshold for a majority of voters. One piece of evidence suggests that it might: A YouGov poll, conducted on Monday, found that 55 percent would support impeachment if “President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate” Joe Biden and his son.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether the hypothetical situation laid out in the poll will prove to be true, and persuasive to most voters. The president, along with many Republican allies, will argue it is an insufficient basis for impeachment. They will probably convince some number of Mr. Trump’s supporters of that.

But the poll at least suggests that the allegations have the potential to move public support for impeachment."

Among the people in Ms. Warren’s audience, there was a sense of outrage about Mr. Trump’s conduct and a sense of support for the steps taken this week by House Democrats to investigate him more aggressively.

But there was little optimism that Mr. Trump might ultimately be removed from office, and some expressed anxiety at the unpredictability of the impeachment process.

Tim Butterworth, a retired teacher who is supporting Ms. Warren, said he believed the House had a duty to proceed with impeachment even though there was “kind of a stone wall” waiting in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Butterworth did not mention Ms. Warren’s support for impeachment among his reasons for supporting her, focusing instead on her plans for addressing economic inequality.

“I think it would be easier to defeat him in an election,” Mr. Butterworth, 75, said of the president. “But when you see a crime being committed, you have to report it. If you don’t, you’re complicit.”

Ellen Moran, an undecided voter who works in urgent care, expressed both exasperation with Mr. Trump and some trepidation about impeachment.

The $391 million aid package in question was provided to Ukraine for its defense against a Russian-backed separatist insurgency in its east which has left more than 13,000 people dead over the past five years.

Mr. Trump also noted that the funds allocated for Ukraine “were fully paid,” although he did not mention the fact that his administration acted only after the delay became public through news media leaks, and under bipartisan pressure from Congress.

He also did not mention that he had changed his explanation for withholding the money from just a day before. On Monday, he linked his decision to block the aid to his concerns about corruption in Ukraine, citing Mr. Biden as an example. By emphasizing instead his overall concern about foreign aid, he was advancing a rationale less tied to his demand for an investigation.

Mr. Trump earlier repeated his assertion that the transcript would exonerate him.

“When you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you’ll see at some point, you’ll understand that call was perfect,” he said.

In a brief interview with Voice of America’s Ukrainian outlet, Mr. Zelensky said he expected continued support from the United States and predicted that a meeting he is scheduled to have with Mr. Trump at the United Nations on Wednesday would “be very warm.”

Among the main questions for Democrats is how unified they are now on an issue that has created deep rifts within their ranks until this week. It is far from clear, for instance, whether they agree on how broad the impeachment inquiry should be, or who should run it. Already on Tuesday, some more moderate lawmakers from Republican-leaning districts, who put themselves at political risk to embrace impeachment, were privately voicing frustration at the lack of certainty about what the inquiry would look like going forward.

Republicans paid a steep political price in the midterm elections for moving to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998, and some analysts believe this episode could backfire on Democrats as well.

But with the party clamor growing for action against the president after the Ukrainian revelations, Ms. Pelosi and others who had been holding back faced the prospect that failing to move forward on demands to hold the president accountable could cost them more with their own party than pursuing impeachment might hurt them with Republicans and independents. Long a progressive hero, Ms. Pelosi had already drawn fire from the left for failing to act.

Even as momentum rapidly built, worries surfaced among Democrats that the drive could fizzle with the release of a transcript of the telephone call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president if it proved less explosive than anticipated — an outcome Republicans predicted. But the speaker and others said that such an outcome would not deter them and that they wanted to hear all of the whistle-blower’s account of what led to the complaint against Mr. Trump, which is believed to include more than the call.

The decision to back the inquiry was not easy for Democrats who had been hesitant to get on board.

“I certainly didn’t run for Congress to be part of an impeachment inquiry,” said Representative Haley Stevens, Democrat of Michigan, who called the phone call an abuse of power. “It’s heartbreaking to look something like impeachment in the face,” she added. “No matter who the president is, we want them to succeed. At the same time, I have to maintain the rule of law and checks and balances.”

While the revelation of the whistle-blower complaint broke the logjam on impeachment, Democrats were becoming increasingly incensed at the proud defiance of the House by the president and his allies, essentially thumbing their noses at a coequal branch of government empowered to oversee the conduct of the administration. The Trump strategy had been effective as recently as a few days ago, when Democrats seemed stymied in their pursuit of the president with the prospect of a formal impeachment inquiry flagging."

But over the past couple of months, and more intensely the past couple of weeks, has come an accelerating accretion of more, and more alarming, information: a whistle-blower complaint had been filed with the inspector general of the intelligence community accusing Mr. Trump of, among other acts, pressing the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, about Mr. Biden; the Department of Justice was blocking the inspector general from passing along the complaint, contra federal law; just days before speaking with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump had directed the White House staff to withhold close to $400 million in military aid from Ukraine.

This episode of extreme politicking by Mr. Trump seems to go straight to questions of national security, and Democratic lawmakers who had been hesitant to call for impeachment began suggesting that it might be inevitable. On Sunday, Ms. Pelosi, a devout impeachment skeptic, gave the administration until Thursday to hand over the whistle-blower complaint or face “a whole new stage of investigation.” Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, felt moved to tweet that it was “critical” for the facts to come out.

Come Monday, and rolling into Tuesday, Washington was buzzing with a nervous energy. Everyone was on high alert, frantically scanning for signs of where things were headed next. Ms. Pelosi was canvassing her members about impeachment. With every House Democrat who stepped forward to speak about Ukraine — Debbie Dingell, Rosa DeLauro, John Lewis — the scramble to analyze the odds of impeachment began anew. In a Monday op-ed in The Washington Post, seven freshman House Democrats, including some from districts Mr. Trump won in 2016, came out in favor of a formal impeachment investigation. Twitter was awash in clichéd metaphors describing the shifting politics — the dam was breaking, the tide was turning, the winds were shifting. (In the real world, it always bears remembering, most people were less transfixed by the news from Washington.)

Republicans remained notably tepid about rushing to the president’s defense. The Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Richard Burr of North Carolina, opened an investigation into the matter and made clear it wanted to hear from the whistle-blower as soon as possible. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, publicly asserted that he had pushed for the funding for Ukraine and received no explanation for why it had been held up by the administration."

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.

Only 11 days have passed since Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, revealed that the Trump administration was illegally withholding a whistle-blower complaint from Congress. When the news came out, I — probably like most observers — expected it to be another fizzle, yet another clear example of Trump malfeasance that would just fail to catch fire with Congress or the public.

And that may yet happen. I presume and hope that pollsters are at work as we speak, trying to gauge public opinion on the scandal. But this time feels different, maybe because it’s so simple and clear cut. The president of the United States and his personal lawyer both admit that they called on a foreign regime to produce dirt on one of his political rivals. It now looks as if he tried to pressure said foreign regime by withholding crucial military aid, which makes it worse.

The result is that this scandal is blowing up in a way previous Trump scandals, no matter how serious, haven’t. A House vote to impeach has quickly gone from “unlikely” to “more likely than not” now that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce a formal impeachment inquiry.

Why does this matter? In general, I dislike the common journalistic trope of “winners and losers” from political developments. In this case, however, it seems to me like a good way to sum up the fallout so far. So here are three winners and two losers from the developments so far."

But here is a compilation of Trump’s hints in the call:

“I would like to have the attorney general call you. … It’s very important that you do it. … I will ask him [Giuliani] to call you along with the attorney general. … If you could speak to him, that would be great. … If you can look into it [the Biden matter] … it sounds horrible to me. … I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call. … I’m sure you will figure it out. … Your economy is going to get better and better, I predict. … I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. … Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.”

If that presidential call were set to music, it could be the soundtrack for a “Godfather” movie.

The Times reports that the acting director of national intelligence and the inspector general for the intelligence community — each appointed by Trump — both referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigation into the president’s actions.

Surprise! Barr’s Justice Department decided not to pursue the matter.

As for the assertion that the real corruption is that of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, that’s false. Ukraine said in May that there was no evidence of illegality by Hunter. I do think that he inappropriately played on his father’s job as vice president to get a board seat with a Ukrainian gas company, just as Trump’s children — and Trump himself — have monetized Trump’s presidency. But whatever Hunter’s impropriety, there is zero evidence of misconduct by his father.

Journalists may try to be evenhanded by saying that Trump did this while Biden did that. That is false equivalence. Let’s be clear: Joe Biden appears to be completely innocent of any wrongdoing in this case, while Trump tried to use the power of the federal government and almost $400 million in taxpayer money to coerce Ukraine into meddling in a U.S. election.

Fresh from allegations of collusion with Russia to win the 2016 election, Trump turns out to have been trying to collude with Ukraine to arrange foreign interference in the 2020 election.

An impeachment inquiry will now unfold, and there’s no reason to prejudge the outcome or rush the process. Let the evidence emerge and be debated.

No one should be gleeful, for an impeachment process is a trauma for our country — and I’m not sure that Democrats living in blue bubbles appreciate the risk that this process may end up helping Republican candidates.

But put politics aside.

Trump weaponized taxpayer dollars to coerce a foreign leader to target U.S. citizens with a criminal investigation, aiming to affect an American presidential election. Whether or not you believe that is impeachable, we should be able to agree that it is unconscionable.

Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign.

Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser in Iowa on Saturday, said he believed that Mr. Trump’s dangerous conduct was at the forefront of Mr. Biden’s mind."

Mr. Zelensky has not announced any new investigations into Mr. Biden or his son. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he said Ukraine had a new prosecutor general, “a highly professional man” who would investigate “any case he considers and deems appropriate.”

“We have an independent country,” he said. “I can’t push anyone.”

Earlier on Wednesday, with the impeachment inquiry now rocketing to the center of attention in the United States, Mr. Zelensky did not make any references to Mr. Trump or even the American military aid for Ukraine in its war with Russian-backed separatists — a central element in the inquiry.

Instead, in his address to the annual General Assembly session at the United Nations, Mr. Zelensky spoke at length about the toll of wars around the world, and especially in Ukraine.

“Nobody will feel safe while Russia is waging war against Ukraine in the center of Europe,” he said. “The thought that this has nothing to do with you or will never touch your interests will be fatal.”

Mr. Zelensky also insisted that every nation had a stake in conflicts that seemed distant.

“We cannot think globally while turning a blind eye to small things, or as some may believe, to trifles,” he continued. “That is how the foundation of two world wars was laid down, and as a result millions of human lives have paid the price for negligence, silence, inaction or an unwillingness to relinquish our own ambitions.”

Mr. Zelensky, 41, vaulted into Ukraine’s highest office this year with an unconventional campaign and an even more unconventional background: He starred in a popular TV comedy about a schoolteacher who is unexpectedly elected president after a rant about corruption is posted online."

I’d Do the Same for Trump.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/impeachment-trump-watergate.html,"Mr. Trump admits that about a week before the infamous phone call, he put nearly $400 million in congressionally appropriated military aid for Ukraine on hold. It was not released until Sept. 11, after news broke of a whistle-blower complaint about the Zelensky call, a complaint that the inspector general for the intelligence community found “credible” and “of urgent concern.” This strongly suggests there was no legitimate reason for the hold.

The Trump administration is expected to release a redacted version of the whistle-blower’s complaint this week , and Mr. Trump says he’ll supply a transcript of the Zelensky call. But an unredacted version of the complaint must be released , and since the transcripts Richard Nixon turned over to Congress were doctored, Congress should also demand a backup recording of the call. Assuming Mr. Trump refuses, Ukraine undoubtedly has a transcript and a recording. That recording could well be analogous to the Nixon White House tapes, which showed the president’s personal involvement in the cover-up, and Congress should request it immediately.

But even if it isn’t conclusive evidence of a shakedown, such a tape of the conversation is likely to show that Mr. Trump, like Mr. Nixon, used his presidential powers against political opponents. Among the grounds for the 1974 committee vote to approve three articles of imp eachment against Mr. Nixon was that he authorized I.R.S. audits of political opponents on his “enemies list” as well as an illegal wiretap on a White House staff member who worked for his chief presidential rival.

Like Mr. Nixon, Mr. Trump appears to have acted for his own personal political interests as opposed to a legitimate national interest. Mr. Nixon used his personal lawyer to pay hush money to the Watergate burglars. Mr. Trump used his personal attorney as the go-between with Mr. Zelensky, urging the Ukrainian president to work with Mr. Giuliani to investigate Mr. Biden.

Going through Mr. Giuliani says it all. If Mr. Trump had a shred of evidence against Mr. Biden or any legitimate governmental objective in view, he would have directed the Justice Department or State Department to work directly with Ukraine."

An intelligence official filed a whistle-blower complaint last month about the president’s actions. The inspector general for the intelligence community deemed the complaint “credible” and “urgent” and forwarded it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, under a law that says such complaints must be shown to Congress within a week.

But Mr. Maguire refused to share the complaint with Congress, saying the Justice Department disagreed with the inspector general’s conclusion that its subject matter was covered under the law that requires disclosing such complaints to Congress. The issue came into the open when the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, sent an angry letter to Mr. Maguire on Sept. 10, accusing him of violating the law.

Mr. Maguire relented as the impeachment inquiry came into focus. He was expected to release a redacted version of the complaint in coming days, people familiar with the situation said late on Tuesday. Administration officials were also said to be working on a deal to allow the whistle-blower to file the complaint to congressional investigators.

Mr. Maguire is set to testify about the matter on Thursday.

What did the whistle-blower claim?

The complaint’s full details remain a mystery, as does the whistle-blower’s identity. Because Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have openly acknowledged pressuring Ukraine about “corruption” and the Bidens, it is not clear how much the complaint involves that is not already in plain view.

But in a closed-door briefing with the House Intelligence Committee, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, said that the complaint involved multiple actions, according to two officials familiar with his briefing, suggesting that the matter goes beyond Mr. Trump’s July phone call.

What does Mr. Trump say?

The president insists that he has been unfairly accused, saying — without offering evidence — that the whistle-blower is “partisan” and that Democrats and the news media are initiating a new “witch hunt” against him. Mr. Trump has also said that he is aware that his conversations with foreign leaders are monitored by numerous government officials and that he would not incriminate himself so easily.

What is Mr. Giuliani’s role?

Mr. Giuliani has communicated with Ukrainian officials for months about the Bidens. He has also pressed them about the circumstances of the 2016 disclosures of payments earmarked by a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, who is in federal prison on convictions related to his Ukrainian political work. Mr. Giuliani has sought information about both subjects and traveled to Madrid this summer for a meeting with one of Mr. Zelensky’s top aides, whom he urged to investigate the matters."

It Could Hurt the Presidency.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/opinion/ukraine-trump.html,"Congressional interference into presidential conversations with foreign leaders would violate Article II. According to Mr. Trump’s critics, the inspector general for the intelligence community can forward any whistle-blower complaint to Congress if it involves a matter of “urgent concern.”

But Congress cannot subject the president to the supervision, control or review of a subordinate officer. As the Supreme Court made clear in a 1926 case, all executive branch officials exist to assist the president in the performance of his constitutional duties. An intelligence officer cannot file a whistle-blower complaint against the president, because the president is not a member of the intelligence community; nor does a presidential phone call with a foreign leader qualify as an intelligence operation. The intelligence community works for the president, not the other way around.

Under the Constitution and long practice, the president alone conducts foreign relations. As Justice George Sutherland wrote for the majority in a 1936 Supreme Court opinion (quoting Chief Justice John Marshall), the president “is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations.”

Beginning with George Washington’s 1796 refusal to provide the House with the Jay Treaty negotiating record, presidents have claimed the right not just to communicate with foreign leaders but also to keep national security information secret. Thomas Jefferson even expanded executive privilege to protect national security information against the courts in 1807, when he refused to testify in the treason trial of Aaron Burr (Chief Justice Marshall, presiding as trial judge, accepted Jefferson’s claim).

Here, good constitutional structure matches good policy. If Congress could regulate presidential discussions with foreign leaders, presidents and foreign leaders would speak less candidly or stop making the calls altogether. United States foreign policy — approved by the American people at each election — would be crippled.

Congress would seize the upper hand in foreign affairs, which has produced disasters such as the War of 1812 and restrictions on aid to the Allies before American entry into World War II. In the 1970s, congressional interference after Watergate handicapped the efforts of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter to respond to the Soviet military buildup, Communist expansion in Latin America and Africa, the fall of Vietnam and Iran’s revolution. Only with Ronald Reagan’s restoration of executive power could the United States carry out the strategy that ultimately won the Cold War.

Democrats may regret again wounding the presidency when Mr. Trump’s successors grapple with the rise of China as a global power, Russia’s revanchism, Iran’s quest for regional hegemony and North Korea’s nuclear proliferation."

The leader of a country recently invaded by Russia would notice if the United States withheld funds amounting to 5 percent of its defense budget.

Indeed, while asking for a foreign country’s aid in going after a political rival is a monstrous abuse of power on its own, the memorandum is also strong evidence that Mr. Trump was offering an implicit quid pro quo. The course of the conversation makes clear the extent to which Mr. Zelensky sought Mr. Trump’s favor and assistance; in that environment, the president’s request for favors could not help being coercive.

Mr. Trump made a point of framing the conversation by saying, “we do a lot for Ukraine” and “I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal necessarily,” suggesting Ukraine could do more for the United States and afterward asking for favors. The implication is unmistakable: We do a lot for you, and I now expect you to do something for me.

Although there will undoubtedly be more shoes to drop, particularly when Congress receives the whistle-blower complaint that brought this scandal to light — the Senate on Tuesday unanimously approved a resolution demanding it — the memorandum is unequivocally damning. The conversation does not end with it, though. Congress’s need for other materials substantiating this apparent impeachable offense is paramount. News reporting suggests that several senior officials tried to prevent Mr. Trump from holding a meeting or call with Mr. Zelensky because they were worried that Mr. Trump would use the conversation to do precisely what he did — ask for damaging information about Mr. Biden. Congress has every right to obtain additional evidence and testimony that places the president’s conversation in appropriate context.

Mr. Trump’s pattern of betraying his country for his own personal gain stretches far beyond the favors he requested of the Ukrainian president. Toward the end of their conversation, Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Trump that the last time he traveled to the United States he “stayed at the Trump Tower.” Mr. Trump’s acceptance of Mr. Zelensky’s business may not have been an unconstitutional emolument because Mr. Zelensky was not a foreign official at the time, but the underlying problem is the same: Like others who seek to get in the president’s good graces, Mr. Zelensky patronized his businesses. The president’s profiting off the presidency and putting out his businesses as centers for cultivating influence is, and must continue to be, an important component of the impeachment inquiry.

Unfortunately, the president we see in this memorandum is not a stranger to us. It is the same man who asked a former White House counsel, Don McGahn, to fire the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and then falsely deny it later.

It is the same man whose 2016 presidential campaign was “receptive” to Russian offers of assistance, including supposed dirt about his political rival."

Here's How Those Plans Would Work (or Not). - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/24/business/economy/wealth-tax-rich.html,"Among Democratic presidential candidates, it’s the rallying cry of the moment — tax the rich. The idea is a centerpiece of the campaigns of Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. A former candidate, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, went so far as to say the government ought to “tax the hell out of the wealthy.”

The new taxes would fund a laundry list of liberal proposals — “Medicare for all,” free college, combating global warming and rebuilding roads and bridges.

But these measures will face fierce opposition, including from wealthy donors. Republicans in Congress are sure to oppose new taxes, making passage impossible unless Democrats take both houses of Congress in 2020. Whatever their political fate, these proposals represent the broadest rethinking of tax policy in decades.

“We seem to go back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on taxing the rich, depending on who is in power,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. “But the Democrats now are a good deal more aggressive than they’ve been in the past.”

Four ideas have gained the most traction: a tax on wealth, raising marginal tax rates, expanding the estate tax and changing how the government taxes capital gains.

Creating a Wealth Tax

How many people would pay? Relatively few. Would it reduce inequality? Almost certainly. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Probably.

In January, Ms. Warren took a bold new approach by proposing to tax wealth, not just income. Her proposal would impose a 2 percent tax on assets above $50 million, or the top 70,000 families by wealth, in a nation of nearly 330 million people. Someone with $100 million in assets would pay $1 million a year. Fortunes over $1 billion would be subject to an additional 1 percent surcharge.

The tax, akin to how property taxes work, would be aimed at a group that controls a growing portion of the nation’s wealth. The 400 richest Americans own 3.5 percent of the country’s assets, according to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists at the University of California, Berkeley, who have advised Ms. Warren. Over time, her tax would reduce that to 2 percent, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. If it had been in place since 1982, the fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, would now be $87 billion, rather than $160 billion, they estimate, using figures from before his divorce.

Ms. Warren’s proposal would bring in $2.6 trillion over 10 years, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. At $260 billion a year, that is a small share of total annual federal spending of $4.4 trillion. Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Natasha Sarin, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, have disputed earlier estimates by the two economists as overly optimistic.

Share of household wealth held by: 40 percent 1940 38% 2016 37% The top 1 percent 30 20 2016 19% 1940 15% The top 0.1 percent 10 0 ’16 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 2016 37% 40 percent 1940 38% The top 1 percent 30 2016 19% 20 The top 0.1 percent 1940 15% 10 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’16 2016 37% 40 percent 1940 38% The top 1 percent 30 2016 19% 20 The top 0.1 percent 1940 15% 10 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’16 Source: Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, “Distributional National Accounts: Methods and Estimates for the United States”

On Tuesday Mr. Sanders is proposing his own wealth tax, one that goes after mega-wealth even more aggressively than Ms. Warren’s proposal. His graduated tax would start at 1 percent for assets of more than $32 million, climbing to 8 percent for wealth exceeding $10 billion. The tax would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over a decade.

As appealing as a wealth tax might sound for the party’s liberal base, enacting it would pose major challenges. Anyone lucky enough to be in its sights has access to top tax lawyers and accountants who can sift through the tax code for a way out, or at least a means of minimizing the hit.

European countries have had mixed success with wealth taxes. Weak enforcement and offshore havens have enabled many individuals to greatly reduce what they owe. The Internal Revenue Service would need detailed reports from banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions to make the tax effective.

“It could raise a lot of money but probably less than Elizabeth Warren thinks,” Mr. Toder said.

Raising top income tax rates

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? Probably. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Yes.

Raising the top income tax rate is one of the most straightforward ways to tax the rich and some prominent Democrats have embraced it. For example, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City has said that the government should impose a 70 percent tax on earnings above $10 million.

While that might sound radical, it would actually represent a return to tax policies that prevailed for decades. The top income tax rate stood at 70 percent as recently as 1980, and was even higher before then, topping 90 percent in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Highest marginal tax rate 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 ’18 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’18 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’18 Source: Tax Policy Center

In terms of inequality, it would effectively reduce some of the extremes in pay that have developed in recent decades. The vast fortunes accumulated by a few dozen billionaires have also made new taxes more politically palatable. For example, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s 70 percent tax would be paid by about 21,000 taxpayers.

Over 10 years, her proposal would raise up to $382 billion, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. That is about half as much as the government will spend on the Defense Department this fiscal year.

With the help of accountants and lawyers, the wealthy would no doubt try to find ways to convert earned income into capital gains or business income, which are currently taxed at lower rates.

Raising the estate tax

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? A lot. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Most likely.

Experts say inherited wealth is an important driver of inequality. The estate tax is meant to combat that, but in recent decades lawmakers have made it easier for taxpayers to avoid it. Mr. Sanders wants to change that.

Under his proposal, the estate tax rate would begin at 45 percent for assets worth more than $3.5 million and rise to 77 percent for those with more than $1 billion. The proposal would apply to just 0.2 percent of the population, according to Mr. Sanders.

The senator’s plan would raise $315 billion over 10 years, or less than half of military spending this year. But the higher tax on estates worth more than $1 billion could raise $2.2 trillion over the long term. Mr. Sanders has said he wants the money to pay for his ambitious agenda of social programs.

Ms. Warren has also proposed expanding the estate tax as part of a housing bill. The estate tax would start at 55 percent and rise to 75 percent. She has said that the tax would affect 14,000 wealthy families a year.

Lawyers and accountants have devised many strategies for avoiding the estate tax, said Kyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the Tax Foundation. Of course, if Congress were to adopt Mr. Sanders’s proposal, lawmakers could also try to close some of those loopholes.

Raising capital gains tax rates

How many people would pay? Relatively few taxpayers. Would it reduce inequality? Most likely. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Possibly.

Several Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, want to end the discrepancy between how different kinds of income are taxed. To wit, long-term capital gains are taxed at a top rate of 20 percent, but the top rate for salary and wage income is 37 percent.

Lower taxes on investment income skew the system in favor of wealthier households and raising capital gains tax rates would change that.

As of 2016, about 80 percent of the income of households that earn less than $198,000 a year comes in the form of wages and salaries, according to a paper by Lily Batchelder and David Kamin of the New York University School of Law. By contrast, capital gains and dividends account for 70 percent of the income of the families that earn $53 million or more a year.

“The way that the very top of earners in our country make money is very different from the rest,” Mr. Kamin said.

The top 10 percent of households by income own 84 percent of all stocks. Mr. Biden’s plan is aimed at this group and would raise the capital gains rate to 39.6 percent for top earners.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who is not running for president, would go further still by fundamentally changing how capital gains are taxed, at least for the wealthiest Americans. He recently proposed taxing the appreciation of stocks held by the richest 0.3 percent of households, even if those gains haven’t been realized. Mr. Wyden also favors equalizing the rate at which earned income and capital gains are taxed.

The senator’s proposal would have the effect of trimming the wings of billionaires who have watched their fortunes soar but haven’t sold their shares.

The proposal from Mr. Wyden would raise an estimated $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion over 10 years, which would be earmarked for Social Security. Mr. Biden would allocate money raised in part from hiking capital gains taxes to pay the $750 billion cost of expanding coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Simply raising capital gains taxes without other reforms is tricky as taxpayers could choose not to sell stocks to avoid owing money. Based on research it has analyzed, the Tax Policy Center estimates that raising the capital gains rate above 30 percent would reduce revenues, Mr. Toder said. Taxing appreciation as Mr. Wyden has proposed would help address this."

Senator Elizabeth Warren explained her policy plans to voters in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders walked a picket line with striking auto workers in Detroit and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. courted donors in Bel Air, Calif., and went on Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night TV show.

But behind the scenes, many of the 2020 Democratic candidates have been grappling with a new reality: For the first time, a presidential primary will unfold with a sitting president seeking re-election while also facing an impeachment inquiry.

There is no political playbook for this. No pollster or strategist to speak from experience. What is clear, from interviews with advisers and allies with the various campaigns, is that the top candidates like Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren believe they are sufficiently established in the race that they can continue to command attention for their candidacies and messages. Second-tier and third-tier candidates, however, are at much greater risk of falling off the radar screen for an electorate that may soon be at a standstill, distracted by an impeachment circus in Washington.

But it’s also worth noting that when it comes to impeachment, the president need not have committed a violation of an ordinary criminal statute to have committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.” That term came out of the British common law tradition and essentially means an abuse of power by a high-level public official.

Arguing for the ratification of the Constitution in 1788, Alexander Hamilton described impeachable crimes as “those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

— Charlie Savage

The Democrats’ Goals

Given everything we know about the Senate, how likely is it that Trump will be removed from office? Is pursuing an impeachment inquiry to remove Trump from power more of an effort to effectively remove him from office or is it more useful in promoting a negative view of the president in the eyes of the public?

— Daniel Vance, Washington

Considering the Republican majority in the Senate, it seems very unlikely that Mr. Trump would be convicted in that chamber if ultimately impeached by the House because it would require 67 votes to remove him. That means a minimum of 20 Republicans would have to break to join all 47 Democrats to oust the president. Senate Republicans have been mainly steadfast in their support of the president thus far."

Mr. Trump’s allies repeatedly invoke the special counsel investigation into his campaign’s dealings with Russia during the 2016 election, which failed to produce the smoking gun-type revelations that many on the left had predicted. The president’s critics, they say, are once again engaging in a smear campaign to declare him guilty before all the evidence is out.

As Mr. Savage said on Wednesday, “He is already in the hay wagon on the way to the guillotine because of the fascist vermin in the media.”

[On the campaign trail with Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor who wants to unseat President Trump.]

They also appear to have learned an important lesson about how Mr. Trump and his attorney general, William P. Barr, managed the narrative of the release of the special counsel report: They are moving fast to tell the story on their terms. And that is a story in which Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden — not Mr. Trump — have covered up wrongdoing involving their Ukrainian interests.

Mr. Hannity, whose radio show each day begins with an announcer declaring that he is “Fighting the Trump-hating liberal media one day at a time,” called the Biden angle “the real story.”

Mr. Limbaugh told listeners, “Joe Biden may be the most corrupt politician in Washington bar none.” Then he offered a novel theory of the origins of the Ukraine-Trump investigations. “This effort going on here is actually a twofer,’’ he said. “It is designed by the Democrats to take out both Trump and Biden and clear the way for anybody else, probably Elizabeth Warren.”"
114,Jamelle Bouie,"The president doesnt deny this. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, Trump said on Sunday.

We want to make sure that country is honest,” Trump said. “If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

There’s no mystery here. Trump doesn’t care about corruption — he runs a network of clubs and hotels where interested parties can spend huge sums and curry favor with the administration — but he is worried about Biden’s popularity with Democrats and the wider public. The former vice president leads in nearly every head-to-head matchup with Trump. If the election were held today and Biden were the nominee, Trump would likely lose by double digits.

But if Trump can make 2020 another race between two unpopular nominees — if he can sully his opponent and make him another creature of “the swamp” — then he has a shot at victory. Imagine a world where the Ukrainian government enters the election on behalf of Trump. The president can now do to Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton in 2016 — mire him in enough scandal and innuendo to undermine the vice president’s claim to honesty. “Crooked Hillary” seamlessly becomes “Crooked Joe.” And Biden is vulnerable. He has spent his entire adult life working in Washington, and there’s little question that his son is involved in the kinds of buck-raking and influence peddling that alienates voters and makes them cynical about politics.

As for the other parts of Trump’s unusual 2016 victory, there isn’t — as far as we know — an F.B.I. investigation of Biden or any other Democratic candidate. But Attorney General William Barr has already shown his willingness to use the law in Trump’s favor, and Trump brought him up in his call with Zelensky. It was Barr, of course, whose misleading summary of the Mueller report initially defused criticism and stymied efforts to hold the president accountable for his attempts to obstruct justice.

Given this commitment to the president’s political interests, it’s not hard to imagine how Barr might use “revelations” from the Ukrainian government to pursue an inquiry into the former vice president and his son, releasing information at a pace that feeds the story, strengthens the appearance of impropriety and ultimately undermines Biden’s campaign. Trump, at least, thinks the attorney general is up to the task. In Trump’s conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Trump referred him to Barr . “There is a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that,” the president said to Zelensky, according to a recently released reconstructed transcript. “So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.” The attorney general of the United States, that is."

Biden Jr. on Saturday if he had spoken to his son Hunter about his work in Ukraine, Mr. Biden jabbed his finger repeatedly at the reporter and shot back: “Ask the right questions.”

A few hours later, when coverage of President Trump’s phone call to Ukraine’s president about Mr. Biden and his son had reached a fever pitch, the Biden campaign emailed the news media to declare — in bold underlined words — that any story would be “misleading” if it did not state upfront that Mr. Trump’s claims were unsubstantiated.

On Sunday night, the Biden campaign released a fund-raising appeal on Twitter asking, “Will media see through Trump’s sleazy playbook ? Or fall for it again?” And by Tuesday, the drumbeat of warnings to the press had grown so intense that even Lanny Davis , a longtime Democratic operative, weighed in, attacking “innuendo journalism.”

For the past three years, every Democratic campaign, politician and activist has operated in the shadow of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss, caught in a cycle of self-recrimination and soul-searching about how to defend themselves against Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in 2020. It’s a conversation that began in the hours after Mrs. Clinton’s unexpected loss, as aides reckoned with their inability to defend her from Mr. Trump’s conspiratorial accusations, and has continued ever since, with Mrs. Clinton herself dispensing advice in private conversations with Democratic primary candidates as they prepared to begin their campaigns."

Although there was no explicit quid pro quo in the conversation, Mr. Trump raised the matter immediately after Mr. Zelensky spoke of his country’s need for more help from the United States. The call came only days after Mr. Trump blocked $391 million in aid to Ukraine, a decision that perplexed national security officials at the time and that he has given conflicting explanations for in recent days.

The aid freeze did not come up during the call, and Mr. Zelensky was not yet aware of it.

Barr on potential corruption investigations connected to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic rival.

Although Mr. Trump sought to present a business-as-usual image in his annual trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly — by highlighting a trade deal with Japan, among other things — his anger and anxiousness took over his day, aides said. He appeared aggrieved in comments to reporters ahead of a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, but by late afternoon, Mr. Trump appeared so exhausted that he spoke unusually slowly at a rambling news conference meant to sum up his trip at the United Nations.

He opened by naming 28 countries whose leaders he had met with and said that, unfortunately, reporters were far more interested in his phone call with Mr. Zelensky. “I’ve been up from early in the morning until late in the evening and meeting with different countries, all for the good of our country,” Mr. Trump said. “And the press doesn’t even cover all of this.”

Then he moved on to the call, and the words he said spoke to the Ukrainian president.

White House lawyers tried to hide the reconstructed call transcript — and had done so before.

In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to “lock down” all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced — as is customary — by the White House Situation Room. This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.

The whistle-blower writes that White House lawyers “directed” White House officials to remove records of the July 25 call from the system where such documents are normally stored and place it instead in a system for storing highly classified information, like files related to covert actions, even though it did not meet the criteria, in order to limit the number of officials who could see it. A White House official told the whistle-blower that it was an “abuse” of that system to instead use it to hide politically sensitive information.

And in an appendix to the complaint, the whistle-blower wrote that White House officials had said this was “not the first time” that a presidential transcript had been treated in that way, “solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive — rather than national security sensitive — information.”

The complaint does not name the White House lawyers. But they would certainly either work for or include the top attorney there — Mr. Trump’s White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone.

3. The State Department saw Giuliani’s rogue outreach to Ukraine for Trump as a threat to national security.

Starting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani’s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kyiv and the President. These officials also told me: that State Department officials, including Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, had spoken with Mr. Giuliani in an attempt to “contain the damage” to U.S. national security; ...

The whistle-blower recounts the struggles by the senior United States diplomats to deal with the confusion created by the president dispatching his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure Ukrainian officials to develop dirt against the Bidens, both in the run-up to the July 25 call and its aftermath. Multiple officials said that Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that any meeting or phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine’s new president would depend on whether the latter was willing to “play ball” on Mr. Giuliani’s demands.

4. Trump’s push for investigations coincided with a “sudden change of policy with respect to U.S. assistance for Ukraine.”

I learned from U.S. officials that, on or around 14 May, the President instructed Vice President Pence to cancel his planned travel to Ukraine to attend President Zelenskyy ’ s inauguration on 20 May; Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the delegation instead. According to these officials, it was also “made clear” to them that the President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenskyy “chose to act” in office.

This is one of two manifestations of pressure on Ukraine by the Trump administration in advance of the July 25 call. The whistle-blower cautioned that he or she did not know for certain whether this action was connected with the broader understanding that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Zelensky to “play ball” on Mr. Giuliani’s demands. The whistle-blower recounted the episode in a partly redacted appendix along with a discussion of Mr. Trump’s blocking of the military aid package Congress appropriated to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression:

On 18 July, an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official informed Departments and Agencies that the President “earlier that month” had issued instructions to suspend all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. Neither OMB nor the NSC staff knew why this instruction had been issued. During interagency meetings on 23 July and 26 July, OMB officials again stated explicitly that the instruction to suspend this assistance had come directly from the President, but they still were unaware of a policy rationale. As of early August, I heard from U.S. officials that some Ukrainian officials were aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy, but I do not know how or when they learned of it.

The appearance that Mr. Trump was using foreign policy as leverage to pressure Ukraine into producing dirt on a political rival is at the heart of the calls to impeach him."

Others might have assumed that the case for impeachment was not strong, given that the party’s elected officials have generally not supported it. They might see it differently now that support from congressional Democrats is all but unanimous.

Alone, these Democratic-leaning voters could move the polls to something close to majority support for impeachment. At best for Democrats, perhaps these voters by themselves could bring the polls to something near where they were in the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, when a slight majority of voters opposed his confirmation.

It is also possible that these easy Democratic targets would leave impeachment well short of majority support. So long as that’s true, there may be some political upside for Republicans.

Whether Democrats can move support higher will probably depend on the allegations themselves. Most voters probably have a very high threshold for supporting impeachment and removal from office, as was the case for President Bill Clinton in 1998. They might think it requires conclusive evidence of criminal activity. Even that may be insufficient.

It is hard to know whether the Ukraine allegations will cross the threshold for a majority of voters. One piece of evidence suggests that it might: A YouGov poll, conducted on Monday, found that 55 percent would support impeachment if “President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate” Joe Biden and his son.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether the hypothetical situation laid out in the poll will prove to be true, and persuasive to most voters. The president, along with many Republican allies, will argue it is an insufficient basis for impeachment. They will probably convince some number of Mr. Trump’s supporters of that.

But the poll at least suggests that the allegations have the potential to move public support for impeachment."

Among the people in Ms. Warren’s audience, there was a sense of outrage about Mr. Trump’s conduct and a sense of support for the steps taken this week by House Democrats to investigate him more aggressively.

But there was little optimism that Mr. Trump might ultimately be removed from office, and some expressed anxiety at the unpredictability of the impeachment process.

Tim Butterworth, a retired teacher who is supporting Ms. Warren, said he believed the House had a duty to proceed with impeachment even though there was “kind of a stone wall” waiting in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Butterworth did not mention Ms. Warren’s support for impeachment among his reasons for supporting her, focusing instead on her plans for addressing economic inequality.

“I think it would be easier to defeat him in an election,” Mr. Butterworth, 75, said of the president. “But when you see a crime being committed, you have to report it. If you don’t, you’re complicit.”

Ellen Moran, an undecided voter who works in urgent care, expressed both exasperation with Mr. Trump and some trepidation about impeachment.

The acting director of national intelligence, under pressure from Congress to release the full complaint of a whistle-blower who touched off the Ukraine impeachment furor, handed over the document to the House Intelligence Committee.

It was delivered just hours before a planned House vote on a non-binding resolution to condemn the Trump administration’s handling of the complaint. All but two Republicans joined House Democrats in voting Wednesday in favor of the resolution. The measure demanded that the complaint be given to Congress, that the whistle-blower be instructed on how to contact the congressional intelligence committees, and that President Trump and his team “cease their public efforts to discredit the whistleblower.”

We will pause here to recall that Eric and Donald Trump Jr. make their living by running around collecting millions in hotel business from Republican supporters. Rudy Giuliani’s son is serving as a public liaison assistant to President Trump. Moving forward.

During his unending march through TV interviews, Giuliani declared that Trump never threatened to withhold Ukrainian aid unless he was given the goods on Joe Biden. Then added that he couldn’t really “tell you if it’s 100 percent.” The president’s main confidant appeared to be saying there’s a chance — 10 percent? 30? 97? — that Trump actually did inform the head of a foreign government he wasn’t going to get the military funding Congress had authorized unless he came up with some dirt on a potential presidential opponent. Wow.

Rudy and Donald have a lot in common. They’ve both been married three times. Giuliani is now being sued for divorce by his latest spouse, who said he had turned into a “different man.” A presumably less reliable version than the one who, as mayor, held a press conference to announce he was breaking up with his then-wife without ever notifying the person in question.

Anyhow, current wife Judith Giuliani claimed that he had taken up with another woman, and that she could testify to his failings as “a spouse and a nurse.” Some Rudy-watchers wondered if that was a reference to his drinking. All we know for sure is that this is a guy who must make Donald Trump feel as if he’s had an exceptionally righteous personal life.

There’s a lot Trump likes about his pal. Undoubtedly including the way he’ll yell “Shut up, moron!” at a fellow panelist — even on Fox News.

Trump forcefully defended Giuliani Wednesday when he was meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, a seemingly cheerful 41-year-old former TV star who very reasonably said he didn’t “want to be involved” in American politics. The two presidents seemed to get along very well. This was possibly because Zelensky has learned the importance at flattering Trump at every turn.

Or maybe it’s their joint show business background. Zelensky starred in a TV series about an idealistic teacher who winds up becoming — yes! — Ukraine president. Our experiment with entertainers hasn’t been quite as successful. If only we’d elected, say, Homer Simpson instead. The First Pal would have been an underemployed barfly, and the whole world would be much happier.

But over the past couple of months, and more intensely the past couple of weeks, has come an accelerating accretion of more, and more alarming, information: a whistle-blower complaint had been filed with the inspector general of the intelligence community accusing Mr. Trump of, among other acts, pressing the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, about Mr. Biden; the Department of Justice was blocking the inspector general from passing along the complaint, contra federal law; just days before speaking with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump had directed the White House staff to withhold close to $400 million in military aid from Ukraine.

This episode of extreme politicking by Mr. Trump seems to go straight to questions of national security, and Democratic lawmakers who had been hesitant to call for impeachment began suggesting that it might be inevitable. On Sunday, Ms. Pelosi, a devout impeachment skeptic, gave the administration until Thursday to hand over the whistle-blower complaint or face “a whole new stage of investigation.” Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, felt moved to tweet that it was “critical” for the facts to come out.

Come Monday, and rolling into Tuesday, Washington was buzzing with a nervous energy. Everyone was on high alert, frantically scanning for signs of where things were headed next. Ms. Pelosi was canvassing her members about impeachment. With every House Democrat who stepped forward to speak about Ukraine — Debbie Dingell, Rosa DeLauro, John Lewis — the scramble to analyze the odds of impeachment began anew. In a Monday op-ed in The Washington Post, seven freshman House Democrats, including some from districts Mr. Trump won in 2016, came out in favor of a formal impeachment investigation. Twitter was awash in clichéd metaphors describing the shifting politics — the dam was breaking, the tide was turning, the winds were shifting. (In the real world, it always bears remembering, most people were less transfixed by the news from Washington.)

Republicans remained notably tepid about rushing to the president’s defense. The Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Richard Burr of North Carolina, opened an investigation into the matter and made clear it wanted to hear from the whistle-blower as soon as possible. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, publicly asserted that he had pushed for the funding for Ukraine and received no explanation for why it had been held up by the administration."

They agreed that nothing about the conversation appears to warrant placement in the extra-secure system.

“We need to look into the allegation that this may not be the only communication of a potentially corrupt character that was shielded by this classified information computer system abused for that purpose,” Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Thursday at the Capitol.

Mr. Schiff and other Democrats say it appears that the White House sought to hide Mr. Trump’s effort to pressure Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election, and his son Hunter Biden, as well as to pursue conspiracy theories that hold that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 presidential election.

“During my tenure, I had no knowledge of documents being moved out for political sensitivity,” said a former Trump White House official familiar with the system. “I don’t know the legality of what was done. It certainly feels unethical.” The official said that decisions to move documents to different levels of classification typically involve the National Security Council’s legal office.

All officials at the agency, whose size has ranged from about 100 to 150 staff members in recent years, have security clearances that allow them access to a shared classified computer network on which countless documents are stored, many of them categorized at relatively low levels of secrecy.

Stored on the less-classified network are transcripts of presidential calls with foreign leaders, which past White Houses have actively distributed widely among national security and foreign policy officials on secure email systems.

After embarrassing leaks in 2017, in which two transcripts of Mr. Trump’s calls with foreign leaders were published in the news media, the Trump White House cut the number of people to whom phone call records were distributed."

That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.”

In addition to its public statements, Mr. Biden’s campaign has warned off some Democrats from participating in a super PAC. One prominent Democrat, David Wilhelm, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had been approached about being involved in the pro-Biden super PAC but had declined to do so after the campaign urged him against it.

Mr. Riddle said a final decision about whether to deploy a super PAC for Mr. Biden would be made in “the coming weeks.”

Mr. Biden clearly needs to jolt his campaign, which has lost ground in the early nominating states to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been largely unscathed by her rivals. And the vice president’s longtime friends increasingly believe that Ms. Warren’s growing strength — along with Mr. Trump’s offensive — is reason enough to risk the backlash they would get from their opponents and campaign finance reform advocates for creating a group reliant on large contributions. But Mr. Riddle said there had been no final decision on whether to proceed with a super PAC, in part because of this risk. Mr. Biden’s two leading competitors for his party’s nomination, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have made getting big money out of politics a major theme of their campaigns. And Mr. Biden has already drawn criticism for his comparative reliance on wealthy donors to fund his candidacy.

“I’m mindful that any effort to do this is going to be disowned by the campaign because of the way Warren has replayed her hand,” said Mr. Rasky, alluding to the senator’s decision not to solicit large campaign checks as a presidential candidate, despite having done so in her Senate campaign.

Mr. Riddle said that any pro-Biden advertising would be focused on responding to attacks from Mr. Trump and Republicans, rather than targeting other Democrats.

Despite Mr. Munger’s presence at the meeting last week, Mr. Riddle said Mr. Munger was not involved in devising the pro-Biden group and had not contributed any money so far. Mr. Munger is the son of Charles Munger, a billionaire who is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment firm."

Re “Trump Asked for ‘Favor’ in Call, Memo Shows” (front page, Sept. 26):

I want to share two important points about impeachment:

1) There’s no need for a quid pro quo. For the president simply to ask a foreign government to investigate his political rival is an impeachable offense. He’s using his official authority to benefit himself personally. That’s enough. Any quid pro quo is gravy, but is not necessary to prove.

2) Another reason a quid pro quo doesn’t matter: Simply by making the request, the president has put himself and the country in jeopardy because now he is beholden to a foreign leader who can use the “favor” he has done as leverage against the president and the United States, whether as blackmail against the president or to extort something not in the United States’ interest.

It’s just like in “The Godfather”: I do you a favor and someday I might ask a favor of you. Any president who puts himself in that position to benefit personally while putting himself and the country at risk should be impeached and removed from office.

To the Editor:

Over the past few weeks, I have explained to my political communication students the various deficits of American democracy. Now, as the press, at its finest, informs the public of a president’s nefarious behavior, a whistle-blower courageously comes forth to reveal the chief executive’s disturbing conversation, and the House of Representatives brandishes time-honored checks and balances, I will tell the class that for all its flaws, democracy in America remains intact, its institutions steering the country forward."

“I would like to have the attorney general call you. … It’s very important that you do it. … I will ask him [Giuliani] to call you along with the attorney general. … If you could speak to him, that would be great. … If you can look into it [the Biden matter] … it sounds horrible to me. … I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call. … I’m sure you will figure it out. … Your economy is going to get better and better, I predict. … I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. … Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.”

If that presidential call were set to music, it could be the soundtrack for a “Godfather” movie.

The Times reports that the acting director of national intelligence and the inspector general for the intelligence community — each appointed by Trump — both referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigation into the president’s actions.

Surprise! Barr’s Justice Department decided not to pursue the matter.

As for the assertion that the real corruption is that of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, that’s false. Ukraine said in May that there was no evidence of illegality by Hunter. I do think that he inappropriately played on his father’s job as vice president to get a board seat with a Ukrainian gas company, just as Trump’s children — and Trump himself — have monetized Trump’s presidency. But whatever Hunter’s impropriety, there is zero evidence of misconduct by his father.

Journalists may try to be evenhanded by saying that Trump did this while Biden did that. That is false equivalence. Let’s be clear: Joe Biden appears to be completely innocent of any wrongdoing in this case, while Trump tried to use the power of the federal government and almost $400 million in taxpayer money to coerce Ukraine into meddling in a U.S. election.

Fresh from allegations of collusion with Russia to win the 2016 election, Trump turns out to have been trying to collude with Ukraine to arrange foreign interference in the 2020 election.

An impeachment inquiry will now unfold, and there’s no reason to prejudge the outcome or rush the process. Let the evidence emerge and be debated.

No one should be gleeful, for an impeachment process is a trauma for our country — and I’m not sure that Democrats living in blue bubbles appreciate the risk that this process may end up helping Republican candidates.

But put politics aside.

Trump weaponized taxpayer dollars to coerce a foreign leader to target U.S. citizens with a criminal investigation, aiming to affect an American presidential election. Whether or not you believe that is impeachable, we should be able to agree that it is unconscionable.

“We have an independent country,” he said. “I can’t push anyone.”

Earlier on Wednesday, with the impeachment inquiry now rocketing to the center of attention in the United States, Mr. Zelensky did not make any references to Mr. Trump or even the American military aid for Ukraine in its war with Russian-backed separatists — a central element in the inquiry.

Instead, in his address to the annual General Assembly session at the United Nations, Mr. Zelensky spoke at length about the toll of wars around the world, and especially in Ukraine.

“Nobody will feel safe while Russia is waging war against Ukraine in the center of Europe,” he said. “The thought that this has nothing to do with you or will never touch your interests will be fatal.”

Mr. Zelensky also insisted that every nation had a stake in conflicts that seemed distant.

“We cannot think globally while turning a blind eye to small things, or as some may believe, to trifles,” he continued. “That is how the foundation of two world wars was laid down, and as a result millions of human lives have paid the price for negligence, silence, inaction or an unwillingness to relinquish our own ambitions.”

Mr. Zelensky, 41, vaulted into Ukraine’s highest office this year with an unconventional campaign and an even more unconventional background: He starred in a popular TV comedy about a schoolteacher who is unexpectedly elected president after a rant about corruption is posted online."

Mr. Trump tells Vice President Mike Pence to cancel a trip to attend Mr. Zelensky’s inauguration, a whistle-blower alleged in a complaint released Thursday. Other administration officials, including Rick Perry, the secretary of energy, attend instead.

He insulted journalists and accused The Washington Post of publishing a “fake article.” He asserted without evidence that Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut had “threatened” Ukrainian officials and claimed that Democrats had timed their impeachment inquiry to disrupt his trip to the United Nations.

Cutting away from the remarks would deprive Mr. Trump of a pulpit for his claims. But news producers often defer to the public’s right to know what its president is saying, especially at a crucial time in the country’s politics.

Several news networks on Wednesday chose to fact-check Mr. Trump after the fact.

“The president leveled several distortions, falsehoods in the course of that 45 minutes,” the CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer told viewers once Mr. Trump concluded his remarks. Mr. Blitzer’s network colleague Jeffrey Toobin called the appearance a “torrent of lies.”

On ABC, the anchor George Stephanopoulos appeared onscreen halfway through the event, informing viewers that there was “no evidence” to support Mr. Trump’s claims about the Bidens. Andrea Mitchell, on NBC, said the accusations against Mr. Murphy were “contrary to any information we have.”

“We don’t know what he’s talking about,” Ms. Mitchell added.

With the 2020 campaign looming, television producers are likely to face more of these thorny choices. “Broadcast journalists in particular are reassessing how they deal with this president in a live context,” said Mark Lukasiewicz, a former NBC News producer and now the dean of Hofstra University’s school of communication."

I’d Do the Same for Trump.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/impeachment-trump-watergate.html,"Mr. Trump admits that about a week before the infamous phone call, he put nearly $400 million in congressionally appropriated military aid for Ukraine on hold. It was not released until Sept. 11, after news broke of a whistle-blower complaint about the Zelensky call, a complaint that the inspector general for the intelligence community found “credible” and “of urgent concern.” This strongly suggests there was no legitimate reason for the hold.

The Trump administration is expected to release a redacted version of the whistle-blower’s complaint this week , and Mr. Trump says he’ll supply a transcript of the Zelensky call. But an unredacted version of the complaint must be released , and since the transcripts Richard Nixon turned over to Congress were doctored, Congress should also demand a backup recording of the call. Assuming Mr. Trump refuses, Ukraine undoubtedly has a transcript and a recording. That recording could well be analogous to the Nixon White House tapes, which showed the president’s personal involvement in the cover-up, and Congress should request it immediately.

But even if it isn’t conclusive evidence of a shakedown, such a tape of the conversation is likely to show that Mr. Trump, like Mr. Nixon, used his presidential powers against political opponents. Among the grounds for the 1974 committee vote to approve three articles of imp eachment against Mr. Nixon was that he authorized I.R.S. audits of political opponents on his “enemies list” as well as an illegal wiretap on a White House staff member who worked for his chief presidential rival.

Like Mr. Nixon, Mr. Trump appears to have acted for his own personal political interests as opposed to a legitimate national interest. Mr. Nixon used his personal lawyer to pay hush money to the Watergate burglars. Mr. Trump used his personal attorney as the go-between with Mr. Zelensky, urging the Ukrainian president to work with Mr. Giuliani to investigate Mr. Biden.

Going through Mr. Giuliani says it all. If Mr. Trump had a shred of evidence against Mr. Biden or any legitimate governmental objective in view, he would have directed the Justice Department or State Department to work directly with Ukraine."

But there’s a strong political argument for moving the process forward this year, given that it gets harder for Democrats to make their case as the election nears — and voters could throw Mr. Trump out of office anyhow. Historically, the process has taken about four months.

How likely is it that Mr. Trump will be removed from office at the end of all this?

Not very. There are no signs that Senate Republicans have any appetite for investigating Mr. Trump. To reach a two-thirds majority in the Senate, at least 20 Republicans would have to vote with every Democrat to remove Mr. Trump from office.

No House Republicans and only two Senate Republicans back any kind of investigation into Mr. Trump. Here’s how Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who described the allegations against Mr. Trump as “deeply troubling,” explained his party’s resistance earlier this week:

There’s such enormous power associated with being the party in power, both in the White House as well as in the Senate and the House. … I think it’s very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that’s most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power.

How does this effect the 2020 election?

This clearly leads to a Joe Walsh surge in Arizona, a Joe Sestak victory in North Dakota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropping out of the race to become a professor of 16th century art history.

Seriously, though, no one really knows.

As my colleague Reid Epstein and I wrote today, it’s probably not great for the lower-polling candidates, who will now face an even greater struggle to get media attention.

How it impacts the front-runners in the race — Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren — is a topic of great debate within Democratic circles right now. We’ve never seen an impeachment inquiry quite like this, leaving the candidates, strategists and assorted prognosticators navigating uncharted political waters.

Also important to remember: Mr. Trump can run for re-election even if he’s impeached by the House. And maybe even if he’s removed by the Senate, too."

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.

I was prepared for the “transcript” released by the White House yesterday to feel anticlimactic. It was, after all, only a partial transcript of the phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky — and a White House utterly lacking in credibility had control over the document. Its release seemed to have the makings of a miniature version of William Barr’s misleading summary of the Mueller report.

But the document turned out to be much more than that. If White House aides thought it would slow the momentum toward impeachment, they miscalculated. By day’s end, a majority of House members had come out in favor of impeachment, and Trump was conducting a desultory news conference, during which he behaved like the kind of “low energy” politician he often mocks.

What struck me most about the document was just how much Trumpism it packed into only five pages, including:

Failure to do the basics of the job. Trump was evidently supposed to call Zelensky to talk about Ukraine’s recent parliamentary elections. Right from the start, however, Trump was confused and focused on Zelensky’s original election, which occurred four months earlier. “The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn’t given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily,” Trump says at the start of the call. Zelensky twice tried to steer Trump toward the correct subject.

Self-absorption. Whom else do you think Trump might have been thinking of when he described a surprising came-from-behind election victory?

Personal enrichment. Trump has made it clear that foreigners and Americans alike can curry favor with him by staying at one of his hotels, and Zelensky got the message: “Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower,” he said.

Lies and deception. Trump offers an outright falsehood about Joe Biden during the call, saying that Biden “stopped” some (non-existent) prosecution, but he also offers a litany of misleading statements, including his reference to the conspiracy theory that Russia did not actually hack Democratic emails in 2016.

Strong-arm tactics. In the call’s key moment, Trump says: “I would like you to do us a favor though.” He also says the following, about a former United States ambassador to Ukraine whom both he and Zelensky trash: “Well, she’s going to go through some things.”

Government officials as personal valets. On the call, Trump roped Barr, the attorney general, into his effort to pressure Zelensky, undermining the Justice Department’s post-Watergate history as an agency that puts service to the law above service to the president.

Self over country. That, of course, is the nub of the call and the reason it has sparked an impeachment inquiry. As Max Boot wrote in The Washington Post: “Trump is explicitly tying U.S. military aid to Ukraine to Ukraine’s willingness ‘to do us a favor.’ He then makes clear that the ‘us’ he is referring to is not the United States of America. It is the Trump campaign.”

An intelligence official filed a whistle-blower complaint last month about the president’s actions. The inspector general for the intelligence community deemed the complaint “credible” and “urgent” and forwarded it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, under a law that says such complaints must be shown to Congress within a week.

But Mr. Maguire refused to share the complaint with Congress, saying the Justice Department disagreed with the inspector general’s conclusion that its subject matter was covered under the law that requires disclosing such complaints to Congress. The issue came into the open when the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, sent an angry letter to Mr. Maguire on Sept. 10, accusing him of violating the law.

Mr. Maguire relented as the impeachment inquiry came into focus. He was expected to release a redacted version of the complaint in coming days, people familiar with the situation said late on Tuesday. Administration officials were also said to be working on a deal to allow the whistle-blower to file the complaint to congressional investigators.

Mr. Maguire is set to testify about the matter on Thursday.

What did the whistle-blower claim?

The complaint’s full details remain a mystery, as does the whistle-blower’s identity. Because Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have openly acknowledged pressuring Ukraine about “corruption” and the Bidens, it is not clear how much the complaint involves that is not already in plain view.

But in a closed-door briefing with the House Intelligence Committee, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, said that the complaint involved multiple actions, according to two officials familiar with his briefing, suggesting that the matter goes beyond Mr. Trump’s July phone call.

What does Mr. Trump say?

The president insists that he has been unfairly accused, saying — without offering evidence — that the whistle-blower is “partisan” and that Democrats and the news media are initiating a new “witch hunt” against him. Mr. Trump has also said that he is aware that his conversations with foreign leaders are monitored by numerous government officials and that he would not incriminate himself so easily.

What is Mr. Giuliani’s role?

Mr. Giuliani has communicated with Ukrainian officials for months about the Bidens. He has also pressed them about the circumstances of the 2016 disclosures of payments earmarked by a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, who is in federal prison on convictions related to his Ukrainian political work. Mr. Giuliani has sought information about both subjects and traveled to Madrid this summer for a meeting with one of Mr. Zelensky’s top aides, whom he urged to investigate the matters."

The show was a comedy.

Now, Mr. Zelensky, a 41-year-old political novice who took office in May, is at the center of an impeachment debate in the United States over whether President Trump tried to pressure him into betraying the principles that catapulted him into office.

“He’s in a different place from many politicians still feeling out their place in the party and hoping to be president someday,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat who has become friendly with Mr. Romney from their service together on the Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s a loyal Republican, but that’s not his first priority — he’s a bit of a throwback.”

For Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump, it is the latest, and perhaps last, installment of an off-and-never-really-on relationship between two men who shared little more than the same political ambition. It began when Mr. Romney, as the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, solicited Mr. Trump’s endorsement, and carried through 2016, when the former Massachusetts governor began the year as a ferocious critic of Mr. Trump but ended it as a supplicant, sharing dinner with a president-elect in hopes of becoming his secretary of state.

Now, though, Mr. Romney holds a crucial position of power. He could be part of an effort to eventually remove Mr. Trump from office, and is already in the ear — and perhaps conscience — of other Republicans.

He plays down his role, noting that he is not trying to lead any sort of insurrection against the president.

“I spoke out because I believe this is a matter of importance and personal principle,” he said. “Nothing more, nothing less.”

But by reproaching Mr. Trump, he offers Democrats the ability to counter claims that the inquiry is a wholly partisan and politically fueled witch hunt, as the president has repeatedly called it. And Mr. Romney both provides cover for and exerts pressure on his fellow Republicans, who are anxiously calibrating what to say about a scandal that only deepened on Thursday when audio emerged of Mr. Trump privately suggesting that government officials who expressed concerns about his dealings with Ukraine deserve to be punished severely."

The leader of a country recently invaded by Russia would notice if the United States withheld funds amounting to 5 percent of its defense budget.

Indeed, while asking for a foreign country’s aid in going after a political rival is a monstrous abuse of power on its own, the memorandum is also strong evidence that Mr. Trump was offering an implicit quid pro quo. The course of the conversation makes clear the extent to which Mr. Zelensky sought Mr. Trump’s favor and assistance; in that environment, the president’s request for favors could not help being coercive.

Mr. Trump made a point of framing the conversation by saying, “we do a lot for Ukraine” and “I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal necessarily,” suggesting Ukraine could do more for the United States and afterward asking for favors. The implication is unmistakable: We do a lot for you, and I now expect you to do something for me.

Although there will undoubtedly be more shoes to drop, particularly when Congress receives the whistle-blower complaint that brought this scandal to light — the Senate on Tuesday unanimously approved a resolution demanding it — the memorandum is unequivocally damning. The conversation does not end with it, though. Congress’s need for other materials substantiating this apparent impeachable offense is paramount. News reporting suggests that several senior officials tried to prevent Mr. Trump from holding a meeting or call with Mr. Zelensky because they were worried that Mr. Trump would use the conversation to do precisely what he did — ask for damaging information about Mr. Biden. Congress has every right to obtain additional evidence and testimony that places the president’s conversation in appropriate context.

Mr. Trump’s pattern of betraying his country for his own personal gain stretches far beyond the favors he requested of the Ukrainian president. Toward the end of their conversation, Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Trump that the last time he traveled to the United States he “stayed at the Trump Tower.” Mr. Trump’s acceptance of Mr. Zelensky’s business may not have been an unconstitutional emolument because Mr. Zelensky was not a foreign official at the time, but the underlying problem is the same: Like others who seek to get in the president’s good graces, Mr. Zelensky patronized his businesses. The president’s profiting off the presidency and putting out his businesses as centers for cultivating influence is, and must continue to be, an important component of the impeachment inquiry.

Unfortunately, the president we see in this memorandum is not a stranger to us. It is the same man who asked a former White House counsel, Don McGahn, to fire the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and then falsely deny it later.

It is the same man whose 2016 presidential campaign was “receptive” to Russian offers of assistance, including supposed dirt about his political rival."

Senator Elizabeth Warren explained her policy plans to voters in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders walked a picket line with striking auto workers in Detroit and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. courted donors in Bel Air, Calif., and went on Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night TV show.

But behind the scenes, many of the 2020 Democratic candidates have been grappling with a new reality: For the first time, a presidential primary will unfold with a sitting president seeking re-election while also facing an impeachment inquiry.

There is no political playbook for this. No pollster or strategist to speak from experience. What is clear, from interviews with advisers and allies with the various campaigns, is that the top candidates like Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren believe they are sufficiently established in the race that they can continue to command attention for their candidacies and messages. Second-tier and third-tier candidates, however, are at much greater risk of falling off the radar screen for an electorate that may soon be at a standstill, distracted by an impeachment circus in Washington.

But it’s also worth noting that when it comes to impeachment, the president need not have committed a violation of an ordinary criminal statute to have committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.” That term came out of the British common law tradition and essentially means an abuse of power by a high-level public official.

Arguing for the ratification of the Constitution in 1788, Alexander Hamilton described impeachable crimes as “those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

— Charlie Savage

The Democrats’ Goals

Given everything we know about the Senate, how likely is it that Trump will be removed from office? Is pursuing an impeachment inquiry to remove Trump from power more of an effort to effectively remove him from office or is it more useful in promoting a negative view of the president in the eyes of the public?

— Daniel Vance, Washington

Considering the Republican majority in the Senate, it seems very unlikely that Mr. Trump would be convicted in that chamber if ultimately impeached by the House because it would require 67 votes to remove him. That means a minimum of 20 Republicans would have to break to join all 47 Democrats to oust the president. Senate Republicans have been mainly steadfast in their support of the president thus far."

Mr. Trump’s allies repeatedly invoke the special counsel investigation into his campaign’s dealings with Russia during the 2016 election, which failed to produce the smoking gun-type revelations that many on the left had predicted. The president’s critics, they say, are once again engaging in a smear campaign to declare him guilty before all the evidence is out.

They also appear to have learned an important lesson about how Mr. Trump and his attorney general, William P. Barr, managed the narrative of the release of the special counsel report: They are moving fast to tell the story on their terms. And that is a story in which Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden — not Mr. Trump — have covered up wrongdoing involving their Ukrainian interests.

Mr. Hannity, whose radio show each day begins with an announcer declaring that he is “Fighting the Trump-hating liberal media one day at a time,” called the Biden angle “the real story.”

Unlike Russia, ruled since the time of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century by a single, strong leader, usually a tyrant, Ukraine has always been a land of competing power centers. This has made it a fertile ground for democracy but also left it a highly fractured nation with an ever shifting constellation of feuding power-brokers who often look to foreigners for help in their internal struggles.

The whistle-blower’s complaint released on Thursday revealed how Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, played into this dynamic, focusing his efforts to get Mr. Biden and his son investigated on a group of senior law-enforcement officials in Ukraine who had been locked for months in a bitter turf war with rival factions within the same state structure.

The officials Mr. Giuliani sought out in the name of fighting corruption were engaged in a long feud with Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau. The bureau, which has worked closely with the F.B.I. and was set up in 2014 with strong support from the Obama administration, is one of the few government agencies in Ukraine that Western diplomats in Kiev view as reasonably honest and competent.

Mr. Giuliani has his own business history in the country as well. More than two years ago, his company, Giuliani Security and Safety, signed a contract with a wealthy Ukrainian, Pavel Fuks, to consult on emergency planning in Mr. Fuks’s hometown, Kharkiv.

At the time, Mr. Fuks and others had become entangled in a complicated $1.5 billion deal to buy Ukrainian government bonds. In an investigation, Al Jazeera reported that the real sellers were sanctioned former insiders in the government of the disgraced former president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych."

Barr on potential corruption investigations connected to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic rival.

Although Mr. Trump sought to present a business-as-usual image in his annual trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly — by highlighting a trade deal with Japan, among other things — his anger and anxiousness took over his day, aides said. He appeared aggrieved in comments to reporters ahead of a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, but by late afternoon, Mr. Trump appeared so exhausted that he spoke unusually slowly at a rambling news conference meant to sum up his trip at the United Nations.

He opened by naming 28 countries whose leaders he had met with and said that, unfortunately, reporters were far more interested in his phone call with Mr. Zelensky. “I’ve been up from early in the morning until late in the evening and meeting with different countries, all for the good of our country,” Mr. Trump said. “And the press doesn’t even cover all of this.”

Then he moved on to the call, and the words he said spoke to the Ukrainian president.

“They were perfect,” Mr. Trump said. “They were all perfect.”"
164,Charlie Savage,"In several public comments, Mr. Lutsenko also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.

Here’s what they say.,2019-09-26,The New York Times,8 Takeaways From the Whistle-Blower Complaint,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/whistleblower-declassified-report.html,"2. White House lawyers tried to hide the reconstructed call transcript — and had done so before.

In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to “lock down” all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced — as is customary — by the White House Situation Room. This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.

The whistle-blower writes that White House lawyers “directed” White House officials to remove records of the July 25 call from the system where such documents are normally stored and place it instead in a system for storing highly classified information, like files related to covert actions, even though it did not meet the criteria, in order to limit the number of officials who could see it. A White House official told the whistle-blower that it was an “abuse” of that system to instead use it to hide politically sensitive information.

And in an appendix to the complaint, the whistle-blower wrote that White House officials had said this was “not the first time” that a presidential transcript had been treated in that way, “solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive — rather than national security sensitive — information.”

The complaint does not name the White House lawyers. But they would certainly either work for or include the top attorney there — Mr. Trump’s White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone.

3. The State Department saw Giuliani’s rogue outreach to Ukraine for Trump as a threat to national security.

Starting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani’s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kyiv and the President. These officials also told me: that State Department officials, including Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, had spoken with Mr. Giuliani in an attempt to “contain the damage” to U.S. national security; ...

The whistle-blower recounts the struggles by the senior United States diplomats to deal with the confusion created by the president dispatching his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure Ukrainian officials to develop dirt against the Bidens, both in the run-up to the July 25 call and its aftermath. Multiple officials said that Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that any meeting or phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine’s new president would depend on whether the latter was willing to “play ball” on Mr. Giuliani’s demands.

4. Trump’s push for investigations coincided with a “sudden change of policy with respect to U.S. assistance for Ukraine.”

I learned from U.S. officials that, on or around 14 May, the President instructed Vice President Pence to cancel his planned travel to Ukraine to attend President Zelenskyy ’ s inauguration on 20 May; Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the delegation instead. According to these officials, it was also “made clear” to them that the President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenskyy “chose to act” in office.

This is one of two manifestations of pressure on Ukraine by the Trump administration in advance of the July 25 call. The whistle-blower cautioned that he or she did not know for certain whether this action was connected with the broader understanding that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Zelensky to “play ball” on Mr. Giuliani’s demands. The whistle-blower recounted the episode in a partly redacted appendix along with a discussion of Mr. Trump’s blocking of the military aid package Congress appropriated to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression:

On 18 July, an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official informed Departments and Agencies that the President “earlier that month” had issued instructions to suspend all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. Neither OMB nor the NSC staff knew why this instruction had been issued. During interagency meetings on 23 July and 26 July, OMB officials again stated explicitly that the instruction to suspend this assistance had come directly from the President, but they still were unaware of a policy rationale. As of early August, I heard from U.S. officials that some Ukrainian officials were aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy, but I do not know how or when they learned of it.

The appearance that Mr. Trump was using foreign policy as leverage to pressure Ukraine into producing dirt on a political rival is at the heart of the calls to impeach him."

The Latest

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threw up a potential roadblock in the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday when he told lawmakers in a letter that a demand from three House committees for American diplomats to sit for depositions this week amounted to “an act of intimidation” and did not allow enough time for the State Department to properly respond.

President Trump on Tuesday kept his focus on an anonymous whistle-blower, asking why he was not “entitled to interview” the person, a day after he said the White House was trying to find out the person’s identity, despite institutional directives and confidentiality protections.

We will pause here to recall that Eric and Donald Trump Jr. make their living by running around collecting millions in hotel business from Republican supporters. Rudy Giuliani’s son is serving as a public liaison assistant to President Trump. Moving forward.

During his unending march through TV interviews, Giuliani declared that Trump never threatened to withhold Ukrainian aid unless he was given the goods on Joe Biden. Then added that he couldn’t really “tell you if it’s 100 percent.” The president’s main confidant appeared to be saying there’s a chance — 10 percent? 30? 97? — that Trump actually did inform the head of a foreign government he wasn’t going to get the military funding Congress had authorized unless he came up with some dirt on a potential presidential opponent. Wow.

Rudy and Donald have a lot in common. They’ve both been married three times. Giuliani is now being sued for divorce by his latest spouse, who said he had turned into a “different man.” A presumably less reliable version than the one who, as mayor, held a press conference to announce he was breaking up with his then-wife without ever notifying the person in question.

Anyhow, current wife Judith Giuliani claimed that he had taken up with another woman, and that she could testify to his failings as “a spouse and a nurse.” Some Rudy-watchers wondered if that was a reference to his drinking. All we know for sure is that this is a guy who must make Donald Trump feel as if he’s had an exceptionally righteous personal life.

There’s a lot Trump likes about his pal. Undoubtedly including the way he’ll yell “Shut up, moron!” at a fellow panelist — even on Fox News.

Trump forcefully defended Giuliani Wednesday when he was meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, a seemingly cheerful 41-year-old former TV star who very reasonably said he didn’t “want to be involved” in American politics. The two presidents seemed to get along very well. This was possibly because Zelensky has learned the importance at flattering Trump at every turn.

Or maybe it’s their joint show business background. Zelensky starred in a TV series about an idealistic teacher who winds up becoming — yes! — Ukraine president. Our experiment with entertainers hasn’t been quite as successful. If only we’d elected, say, Homer Simpson instead. The First Pal would have been an underemployed barfly, and the whole world would be much happier.

After all, Donald J. Trump, before he was president of the United States, was a television personality and a onetime Broadway producer. (The show was a flop.) And Volodymyr Zelensky, before he was president of Ukraine, was an actor and a comedian.

So why, between them, couldn’t they come up with something better than a ham-handed parody of macho arm-twisting and submissive toadying in the manner of third-rate David Mamet or Harold Pinter?

To be fair, their performance of the material on the morning of July 25 was largely improvised and not meant to be repeated. The working title was “Eyes Only.” Pressure from Congress is what finally forced Mr. Trump to declassify the conversation, putting this act of political theater in the public domain.

It won’t win any prizes for subtlety there; as drama, it’s too clumsy and obvious.

Mr. Mamet, the author of criminal comedies including “American Buffalo” and “Glengarry Glen Ross,” had a much better bead on the poetics of thuggishness. His junk store thieves and real estate scammers observed the ABC rule — “always be closing”— but were patient and strategic in achieving their ends."

Computer System - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/whistleblower-nsc-computer-system.html,"The handling of the Ukraine call transcript has raised alarms among Democrats in Congress and former national security officials of both parties, including ones who served in the Trump administration. They agreed that nothing about the conversation appears to warrant placement in the extra-secure system.

“We need to look into the allegation that this may not be the only communication of a potentially corrupt character that was shielded by this classified information computer system abused for that purpose,” Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Thursday at the Capitol.

Mr. Schiff and other Democrats say it appears that the White House sought to hide Mr. Trump’s effort to pressure Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election, and his son Hunter Biden, as well as to pursue conspiracy theories that hold that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 presidential election.

“During my tenure, I had no knowledge of documents being moved out for political sensitivity,” said a former Trump White House official familiar with the system. “I don’t know the legality of what was done. It certainly feels unethical.” The official said that decisions to move documents to different levels of classification typically involve the National Security Council’s legal office.

All officials at the agency, whose size has ranged from about 100 to 150 staff members in recent years, have security clearances that allow them access to a shared classified computer network on which countless documents are stored, many of them categorized at relatively low levels of secrecy.

Stored on the less-classified network are transcripts of presidential calls with foreign leaders, which past White Houses have actively distributed widely among national security and foreign policy officials on secure email systems.

After embarrassing leaks in 2017, in which two transcripts of Mr. Trump’s calls with foreign leaders were published in the news media, the Trump White House cut the number of people to whom phone call records were distributed."

That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.”

In addition to its public statements, Mr. Biden’s campaign has warned off some Democrats from participating in a super PAC. One prominent Democrat, David Wilhelm, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had been approached about being involved in the pro-Biden super PAC but had declined to do so after the campaign urged him against it.

Mr. Riddle said a final decision about whether to deploy a super PAC for Mr. Biden would be made in “the coming weeks.”

Mr. Biden clearly needs to jolt his campaign, which has lost ground in the early nominating states to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been largely unscathed by her rivals. And the vice president’s longtime friends increasingly believe that Ms. Warren’s growing strength — along with Mr. Trump’s offensive — is reason enough to risk the backlash they would get from their opponents and campaign finance reform advocates for creating a group reliant on large contributions. But Mr. Riddle said there had been no final decision on whether to proceed with a super PAC, in part because of this risk. Mr. Biden’s two leading competitors for his party’s nomination, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have made getting big money out of politics a major theme of their campaigns. And Mr. Biden has already drawn criticism for his comparative reliance on wealthy donors to fund his candidacy.

“I’m mindful that any effort to do this is going to be disowned by the campaign because of the way Warren has replayed her hand,” said Mr. Rasky, alluding to the senator’s decision not to solicit large campaign checks as a presidential candidate, despite having done so in her Senate campaign.

Mr. Riddle said that any pro-Biden advertising would be focused on responding to attacks from Mr. Trump and Republicans, rather than targeting other Democrats.

Despite Mr. Munger’s presence at the meeting last week, Mr. Riddle said Mr. Munger was not involved in devising the pro-Biden group and had not contributed any money so far. Mr. Munger is the son of Charles Munger, a billionaire who is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment firm."

Earlier in the week, an episode of the talk show “The Five” deteriorated after the liberal pundit Juan Williams suggested that his conservative co-hosts were echoing talking points from the White House. “Asking a foreign government to investigate a political rival is illegal,” Mr. Williams said, before his colleagues angrily shouted him down.

“You get that from Media Matters, Juan?” one co-host, Greg Gutfeld, said in an angered tone, referring to an advocacy group that regularly denigrates Fox News. Even by the standards of “The Five,” it was a stinging exchange.

Mr. Wallace, in his appearances Friday on Fox News, offered a grim analysis of Mr. Trump’s political standing, even as he made clear he did not view impeachment as inevitable. But he swatted down some of his colleagues’ suggestions that the whistle-blower’s complaint contained little of note.

“To dismiss this as a political hack seems to be an effort by the president’s defenders to make nothing out of something, and there is something here,” Mr. Wallace said.

At one point, the news anchor Sandra Smith challenged Mr. Wallace, saying that she did not see a clear offer of quid pro quo — “the exchange of something for value” — in the rough transcript of Mr. Trump’s call.

Mr. Wallace arched a brow. “You don’t think that dirt on Joe Biden and Joe Biden’s son would be of value?” he asked."

• Endeavor, the entertainment conglomerate run by Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, pulled its I.P.O. yesterday, after previously cutting the price range.

“The rejection threatens Silicon Valley’s favored approach to building companies,” the NYT writes. Buzzy businesses had relied on huge sums from venture capitalists to grow quickly. But if public market investors are increasingly disdainful of such companies, start-ups may find it harder to get funding in the first place."

Re “Trump Asked for ‘Favor’ in Call, Memo Shows” (front page, Sept. 26):

I want to share two important points about impeachment:

1) There’s no need for a quid pro quo. For the president simply to ask a foreign government to investigate his political rival is an impeachable offense. He’s using his official authority to benefit himself personally. That’s enough. Any quid pro quo is gravy, but is not necessary to prove.

2) Another reason a quid pro quo doesn’t matter: Simply by making the request, the president has put himself and the country in jeopardy because now he is beholden to a foreign leader who can use the “favor” he has done as leverage against the president and the United States, whether as blackmail against the president or to extort something not in the United States’ interest.

It’s just like in “The Godfather”: I do you a favor and someday I might ask a favor of you. Any president who puts himself in that position to benefit personally while putting himself and the country at risk should be impeached and removed from office.

The whistleblower’s complaint, released Thursday, concerns a July phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. The controversy has become the biggest political danger to Mr. Trump’s presidency as it rallied House Democrats this week to launch impeachment proceedings.

President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, meets in New York for hours with a Ukrainian prosecutor. Mr. Giuliani pushes for information about — and investigations into — Mr. Trump’s rivals, including Mr. Biden. Mr. Giuliani briefs Mr. Trump on his efforts.



On Fox News, Mr. Giuliani suggests that Mr. Biden, in an effort to benefit his son Hunter Biden, pushed for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into the owner of a company that was paying his son. Mr. Giuliani also calls for an investigation into Ukraine’s involvement in the origins of the inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.



Mr. Trump calls Ukraine’s president-elect, Volodymyr Zelensky, to congratulate him, and asks Mr. Zelensky to pursue investigations of “corruption.”

Mr. Giuliani cancels his trip to Kiev.



Mr. Trump tells Vice President Mike Pence to cancel a trip to attend Mr. Zelensky’s inauguration, a whistle-blower alleged in a complaint released Thursday. Other administration officials, including Rick Perry, the secretary of energy, attend instead.



After a U.S. delegation returns from a trip to Mr. Zelensky’s inauguration, Mr. Trump is briefed on their favorable impressions of the new Ukrainian leader. Mr. Trump responds that he thinks all Ukrainian politicians are corrupt.



Mr. Trump indicates to ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that he would accept damaging information on a political rival from a foreign government.

Mr. Yermak talks to Mr. Giuliani by phone for the first time.



Mr. Trump instructs Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, to hold back almost $400 million in aid to Ukraine.



Mr. Trump speaks to Mr. Zelensky by phone and asks for a “favor”: Ukraine's help in looking into an unfounded conspiracy theory holding that Ukrainians — and not the Russian government — were involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Trump goes on to cite his desire to look at Mr. Biden and his son, and suggests that Mr. Zelensky work with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Barr.

He insulted journalists and accused The Washington Post of publishing a “fake article.” He asserted without evidence that Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut had “threatened” Ukrainian officials and claimed that Democrats had timed their impeachment inquiry to disrupt his trip to the United Nations.

Cutting away from the remarks would deprive Mr. Trump of a pulpit for his claims. But news producers often defer to the public’s right to know what its president is saying, especially at a crucial time in the country’s politics.

Several news networks on Wednesday chose to fact-check Mr. Trump after the fact.

“The president leveled several distortions, falsehoods in the course of that 45 minutes,” the CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer told viewers once Mr. Trump concluded his remarks. Mr. Blitzer’s network colleague Jeffrey Toobin called the appearance a “torrent of lies.”

On ABC, the anchor George Stephanopoulos appeared onscreen halfway through the event, informing viewers that there was “no evidence” to support Mr. Trump’s claims about the Bidens. Andrea Mitchell, on NBC, said the accusations against Mr. Murphy were “contrary to any information we have.”

“We don’t know what he’s talking about,” Ms. Mitchell added.

With the 2020 campaign looming, television producers are likely to face more of these thorny choices. “Broadcast journalists in particular are reassessing how they deal with this president in a live context,” said Mark Lukasiewicz, a former NBC News producer and now the dean of Hofstra University’s school of communication."

But there’s a strong political argument for moving the process forward this year, given that it gets harder for Democrats to make their case as the election nears — and voters could throw Mr. Trump out of office anyhow. Historically, the process has taken about four months.

How likely is it that Mr. Trump will be removed from office at the end of all this?

Not very. There are no signs that Senate Republicans have any appetite for investigating Mr. Trump. To reach a two-thirds majority in the Senate, at least 20 Republicans would have to vote with every Democrat to remove Mr. Trump from office.

No House Republicans and only two Senate Republicans back any kind of investigation into Mr. Trump. Here’s how Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who described the allegations against Mr. Trump as “deeply troubling,” explained his party’s resistance earlier this week:

There’s such enormous power associated with being the party in power, both in the White House as well as in the Senate and the House. … I think it’s very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that’s most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power.

How does this effect the 2020 election?

This clearly leads to a Joe Walsh surge in Arizona, a Joe Sestak victory in North Dakota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropping out of the race to become a professor of 16th century art history.

Seriously, though, no one really knows.

As my colleague Reid Epstein and I wrote today, it’s probably not great for the lower-polling candidates, who will now face an even greater struggle to get media attention.

How it impacts the front-runners in the race — Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren — is a topic of great debate within Democratic circles right now. We’ve never seen an impeachment inquiry quite like this, leaving the candidates, strategists and assorted prognosticators navigating uncharted political waters.

Also important to remember: Mr. Trump can run for re-election even if he’s impeached by the House. And maybe even if he’s removed by the Senate, too."

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.

I was prepared for the “transcript” released by the White House yesterday to feel anticlimactic. It was, after all, only a partial transcript of the phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky — and a White House utterly lacking in credibility had control over the document. Its release seemed to have the makings of a miniature version of William Barr’s misleading summary of the Mueller report.

But the document turned out to be much more than that. If White House aides thought it would slow the momentum toward impeachment, they miscalculated. By day’s end, a majority of House members had come out in favor of impeachment, and Trump was conducting a desultory news conference, during which he behaved like the kind of “low energy” politician he often mocks.

What struck me most about the document was just how much Trumpism it packed into only five pages, including:

Failure to do the basics of the job. Trump was evidently supposed to call Zelensky to talk about Ukraine’s recent parliamentary elections. Right from the start, however, Trump was confused and focused on Zelensky’s original election, which occurred four months earlier. “The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn’t given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily,” Trump says at the start of the call. Zelensky twice tried to steer Trump toward the correct subject.

Self-absorption. Whom else do you think Trump might have been thinking of when he described a surprising came-from-behind election victory?

Personal enrichment. Trump has made it clear that foreigners and Americans alike can curry favor with him by staying at one of his hotels, and Zelensky got the message: “Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower,” he said.

Lies and deception. Trump offers an outright falsehood about Joe Biden during the call, saying that Biden “stopped” some (non-existent) prosecution, but he also offers a litany of misleading statements, including his reference to the conspiracy theory that Russia did not actually hack Democratic emails in 2016.

Strong-arm tactics. In the call’s key moment, Trump says: “I would like you to do us a favor though.” He also says the following, about a former United States ambassador to Ukraine whom both he and Zelensky trash: “Well, she’s going to go through some things.”

Government officials as personal valets. On the call, Trump roped Barr, the attorney general, into his effort to pressure Zelensky, undermining the Justice Department’s post-Watergate history as an agency that puts service to the law above service to the president.

Self over country. That, of course, is the nub of the call and the reason it has sparked an impeachment inquiry. As Max Boot wrote in The Washington Post: “Trump is explicitly tying U.S. military aid to Ukraine to Ukraine’s willingness ‘to do us a favor.’ He then makes clear that the ‘us’ he is referring to is not the United States of America. It is the Trump campaign.”

Yovanovitch, his former ambassador to Ukraine, were ominous. In a telephone conversation that has set off a political crisis for Mr. Trump, he told Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, that she was “bad news.”

“She’s going to go through some things,” he added.

In fact, she already has gone through quite a bit. Over the past several months, Ms. Yovanovitch, a decorated 33-year veteran of the State Department, has been vilified in the right-wing news media, denounced by the president’s eldest son as a “joker,” called a Democratic stooge by the president’s personal lawyer and then abruptly recalled from Kiev this May, months ahead of schedule.

Her supposed sin, never backed up by evidence, was that she had shown disloyalty to Mr. Trump, disparaging him behind his back. Her friends, who say her professionalism and history of diplomatic service make that highly unlikely, have another theory: She had turned into collateral damage in efforts by Mr. Trump and Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, to damage the reputation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., perhaps Mr. Trump’s most prominent Democratic rival in 2020.

Among the apparent strikes against her: A former Ukrainian prosecutor claimed in an interview with The New York Times that Ms. Yovanovitch had blocked his team from getting visas to the United States to deliver damaging information about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter to the F.B.I."

Biden Jr. in return for American aid. “It’s a joke,” he declared. “Impeachment for that?”

For both men, the bravado masked a precarious future.

Mr. Johnson has lost vote after vote in Parliament since he came into office, including one aimed at forcing him to ask Brussels to delay Britain’s departure from the European Union beyond the deadline of Oct. 31 — something he has said he would rather die “in a ditch” than do. Opponents have accused him of misleading Queen Elizabeth II in asking her to suspend Parliament, and called for his resignation.

Mr. Trump said he believed he had put impeachment behind him when the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, issued his report on the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. He now faces the genuine prospect of being the third president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.

Rather than compromise, however, both have dug in their heels, apparently calculating that an unsparing response will galvanize their political bases and allow them to ride out the current turmoil. In the process, they have used language that has stunned even those used to the cut-and-thrust of politics.

On Wednesday, Mr. Johnson said Britain should press ahead with Brexit to honor the memory of Jo Cox, a member of Parliament who was adamantly pro-European and was killed a week before the 2016 Brexit referendum by a right-wing assassin. Mr. Johnson’s own sister, Rachel, condemned his words as inflammatory.

“It was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered M.P., murdered by someone who said, ‘Britain first,’ ” she said to Sky News.

Mr. Trump told American diplomats he wanted to hunt down the officials who gave a whistle-blower information about his call with the Ukrainian president. Anyone who did so was “close to a spy,” he said, adding, “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?”"

“He’s in a different place from many politicians still feeling out their place in the party and hoping to be president someday,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat who has become friendly with Mr. Romney from their service together on the Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s a loyal Republican, but that’s not his first priority — he’s a bit of a throwback.”

For Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump, it is the latest, and perhaps last, installment of an off-and-never-really-on relationship between two men who shared little more than the same political ambition. It began when Mr. Romney, as the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, solicited Mr. Trump’s endorsement, and carried through 2016, when the former Massachusetts governor began the year as a ferocious critic of Mr. Trump but ended it as a supplicant, sharing dinner with a president-elect in hopes of becoming his secretary of state.

Now, though, Mr. Romney holds a crucial position of power. He could be part of an effort to eventually remove Mr. Trump from office, and is already in the ear — and perhaps conscience — of other Republicans.

He plays down his role, noting that he is not trying to lead any sort of insurrection against the president.

“I spoke out because I believe this is a matter of importance and personal principle,” he said. “Nothing more, nothing less.”

But by reproaching Mr. Trump, he offers Democrats the ability to counter claims that the inquiry is a wholly partisan and politically fueled witch hunt, as the president has repeatedly called it. And Mr. Romney both provides cover for and exerts pressure on his fellow Republicans, who are anxiously calibrating what to say about a scandal that only deepened on Thursday when audio emerged of Mr. Trump privately suggesting that government officials who expressed concerns about his dealings with Ukraine deserve to be punished severely."

Nevertheless, the use of the system has come under scrutiny after the unclassified version of the whistle-blower complaint was made public. The complaint raised questions that the July 25 call with the Ukrainian president had been improperly placed in the classified system, suggesting that officials put the reconstructed transcript into a system meant to protect the nation’s most sensitive secrets.

The Trump administration said on Friday that National Security Council lawyers had made the decision to place the reconstructed transcript of that phone call into a highly classified computer system accessible to only a small number of officials.

“N.S.C. lawyers directed that the classified document be handled appropriately,” said a senior administration official. The statement was also first reported by CNN.

But the official did not actually say how the document was handled, nor address the whistle-blower’s specific charge that the reconstructed transcript, in what would be a highly unusual action, was moved from a computer system widely accessible to National Security Council officials to one reserved for those with code-word clearance to handle the country’s most closely guarded secrets like covert operations and foreign surveillance.

A White House spokesman did not respond when asked about that specific claim. Democrats in Congress and former N.S.C. officials and lawyers in both parties have said such an action, if motivated by a desire to conceal Mr. Trump’s efforts to put political pressure on the Ukrainian leader, would be far from appropriate, and at a minimum, unethical. But in a combative exchange with reporters later in the day, Kellyanne Conway, a White House counselor, repeated the spokesman’s language, saying that “as I understand, the document was handled appropriately at all times.”

“I think the most important thing about said document is that the whole world has access to it now,” Ms. Conway said, citing its release by the White House this week."

“In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,” the whistle-blower wrote. “This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president’s main domestic political rivals. The president’s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.”"

In a private chat room, pro-Trump internet trolls discussed which memes, videos and news stories to push on social media in order to reclaim the narrative.

The last time America watched an impeachment inquiry, it was largely an analog affair. When the House voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton in 1998, only one in four American homes had internet access. AOL and Yahoo were the biggest websites in the world, and “tweet” was a sound birds made.

If the inquiry opened by House Democrats this week results in a formal impeachment of Mr. Trump, it will be the first of the social media era. In many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event. The political stakes are high, the dramatic story unspools tidbit by tidbit and the stark us-versus-them dynamics provide plenty of fodder for emotionally charged social media brawls."

After the Ukrainian president described his need for more American assistance against Russia, Mr. Trump asked him to “do us a favor, though” and look into Democrats.

Mr. Volker was not on that call, and he was neither shown a copy of the transcript reconstructed from the conversation nor told that the president mentioned Mr. Biden, according to one person informed about the series of events. Mr. Volker participated in Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session this week in his last official duty.

“Kurt was one of the good ones who went in to the administration to stave off disaster,” said Thomas Wright, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “They all have to speak out now about everything they know and let the chips fall where they may.”

Mr. Volker, a former career foreign service officer who represented President George W. Bush at NATO and now serves as the executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University based in Washington, spent much of the year trying to bring Mr. Trump together with Mr. Zelensky to bolster the government elected in April.

He argued to Trump administration officials that Mr. Zelensky was a credible reformer and serious figure who could be his country’s last chance to get its act together in the face of Russian aggression. It was an uphill task, given Mr. Trump’s open disdain for Ukrainians; “they’re all corrupt and they tried to take me down,” he said in a private meeting last spring.

After the Ukrainian inauguration, Mr. Trump agreed to meet with Mr. Zelensky, but his staff kept delaying putting a date on the calendar. Like other officials, Mr. Volker was surprised to learn that Mr. Trump had ordered $391 million in aid to Ukraine frozen.

But he kept working to bring the two presidents together. Finally, the White House agreed to schedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky during the American president’s visit to Warsaw, only to scratch the meeting when Mr. Trump decided to stay home to monitor a hurricane."

“Donald Trump is terrified of Joe Biden because the Vice President would beat him like a drum,” she said.

No evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son in his work in Ukraine.

Mr. Biden’s return to the campaign trail on Friday represented the start of a critical and unpredictable phase of his presidential bid: He is now not only running to lead the Democrats against Mr. Trump in 2020, but he is also grappling with a national spotlight on his family, and how to handle questions — and any potential political fallout — associated with his role in the Ukraine story line that House Democrats are now investigating.

Mr. Trump has been regularly attacking Mr. Biden and his son over their dealings with Ukraine, often using innuendo and falsehoods. The president has also delivered deeply personal insults about Hunter Biden, seemingly trying to bait the elder Mr. Biden into retaliating.

How Mr. Biden handles Mr. Trump’s constant broadsides — as well as questions from reporters and voters about Ukraine, impeachment and his son’s business history — will be a significant test for the candidate who has topped polls for much of the primary race but has seen his lead dip recently.

“You have to be strategic and thoughtful about how you respond and when you respond and the nature of your response,” said the former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack, who attended a recent Biden fund-raiser but has not endorsed any candidate. “He has focused as much on the damage to the country, the concerns he has about misuse of power, as he has on the personal side of this.”"

Unlike Russia, ruled since the time of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century by a single, strong leader, usually a tyrant, Ukraine has always been a land of competing power centers. This has made it a fertile ground for democracy but also left it a highly fractured nation with an ever shifting constellation of feuding power-brokers who often look to foreigners for help in their internal struggles.

The whistle-blower’s complaint released on Thursday revealed how Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, played into this dynamic, focusing his efforts to get Mr. Biden and his son investigated on a group of senior law-enforcement officials in Ukraine who had been locked for months in a bitter turf war with rival factions within the same state structure.

The officials Mr. Giuliani sought out in the name of fighting corruption were engaged in a long feud with Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau. The bureau, which has worked closely with the F.B.I. and was set up in 2014 with strong support from the Obama administration, is one of the few government agencies in Ukraine that Western diplomats in Kiev view as reasonably honest and competent.

Mr. Giuliani has his own business history in the country as well. More than two years ago, his company, Giuliani Security and Safety, signed a contract with a wealthy Ukrainian, Pavel Fuks, to consult on emergency planning in Mr. Fuks’s hometown, Kharkiv.

At the time, Mr. Fuks and others had become entangled in a complicated $1.5 billion deal to buy Ukrainian government bonds. In an investigation, Al Jazeera reported that the real sellers were sanctioned former insiders in the government of the disgraced former president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych."

The Latest

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threw up a potential roadblock in the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday when he told lawmakers in a letter that a demand from three House committees for American diplomats to sit for depositions this week amounted to “an act of intimidation” and did not allow enough time for the State Department to properly respond.

President Trump on Tuesday kept his focus on an anonymous whistle-blower, asking why he was not “entitled to interview” the person, a day after he said the White House was trying to find out the person’s identity, despite institutional directives and confidentiality protections.

Poroshenko was still the president of Ukraine earlier this year when his team sought a lifeline. With the polls showing him in clear danger of losing his re-election campaign, some of his associates, eager to hold on to their own jobs and influence, took steps that could have yielded a signal of public support from a vital ally: President Trump.

Over several weeks in March, the office of Ukraine’s top prosecutor moved ahead on two investigations of intense interest to Mr. Trump. One was focused on an oligarch — previously cleared of wrongdoing by the same prosecutor — whose company employed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son. The other dealt with the release by a separate Ukrainian law enforcement agency to the media of information that hurt Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign.

The actions by the prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, did not come out of thin air. They were the first visible results of a remarkable behind-the-scenes campaign to gather and disseminate political dirt from a foreign country, encouraged by Mr. Trump and carried out by his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. In the last week their engagement with Ukraine has prompted a formal impeachment inquiry into whether the president courted foreign interference to hurt a leading political rival.

The story of how Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani operated in Ukraine has emerged gradually in recent months. It was laid out in further detail in the past week in a reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump’s phone call this summer with a new Ukrainian president and in a complaint filed by a whistle-blower inside the United States government."

Earlier in the week, an episode of the talk show “The Five” deteriorated after the liberal pundit Juan Williams suggested that his conservative co-hosts were echoing talking points from the White House. “Asking a foreign government to investigate a political rival is illegal,” Mr. Williams said, before his colleagues angrily shouted him down.

“You get that from Media Matters, Juan?” one co-host, Greg Gutfeld, said in an angered tone, referring to an advocacy group that regularly denigrates Fox News. Even by the standards of “The Five,” it was a stinging exchange.

Mr. Wallace, in his appearances Friday on Fox News, offered a grim analysis of Mr. Trump’s political standing, even as he made clear he did not view impeachment as inevitable. But he swatted down some of his colleagues’ suggestions that the whistle-blower’s complaint contained little of note.

“To dismiss this as a political hack seems to be an effort by the president’s defenders to make nothing out of something, and there is something here,” Mr. Wallace said.

At one point, the news anchor Sandra Smith challenged Mr. Wallace, saying that she did not see a clear offer of quid pro quo — “the exchange of something for value” — in the rough transcript of Mr. Trump’s call.

Mr. Wallace arched a brow. “You don’t think that dirt on Joe Biden and Joe Biden’s son would be of value?” he asked."

• Peloton, the maker of home fitness bikes, saw its shares tumble 11 percent below their I.P.O. yesterday, one of the worst debuts of the year.

• Endeavor, the entertainment conglomerate run by Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, pulled its I.P.O. yesterday, after previously cutting the price range.

“The rejection threatens Silicon Valley’s favored approach to building companies,” the NYT writes. Buzzy businesses had relied on huge sums from venture capitalists to grow quickly. But if public market investors are increasingly disdainful of such companies, start-ups may find it harder to get funding in the first place."

It wasn’t clear that either development related directly to the center-stage role of the Ukrainian president, a former comedian, in the impeachment inquiry getting underway in the United States Congress. Committees in the House are investigating whether President Trump abused his powers in asking Mr. Zelensky for a political “favor” — an investigation in Ukraine into leading Democrats.

Yovanovitch, his former ambassador to Ukraine, were ominous. In a telephone conversation that has set off a political crisis for Mr. Trump, he told Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, that she was “bad news.”

“She’s going to go through some things,” he added.

In fact, she already has gone through quite a bit. Over the past several months, Ms. Yovanovitch, a decorated 33-year veteran of the State Department, has been vilified in the right-wing news media, denounced by the president’s eldest son as a “joker,” called a Democratic stooge by the president’s personal lawyer and then abruptly recalled from Kiev this May, months ahead of schedule.

Her supposed sin, never backed up by evidence, was that she had shown disloyalty to Mr. Trump, disparaging him behind his back. Her friends, who say her professionalism and history of diplomatic service make that highly unlikely, have another theory: She had turned into collateral damage in efforts by Mr. Trump and Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, to damage the reputation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., perhaps Mr. Trump’s most prominent Democratic rival in 2020.

For both men, the bravado masked a precarious future.

Mr. Johnson has lost vote after vote in Parliament since he came into office, including one aimed at forcing him to ask Brussels to delay Britain’s departure from the European Union beyond the deadline of Oct. 31 — something he has said he would rather die “in a ditch” than do. Opponents have accused him of misleading Queen Elizabeth II in asking her to suspend Parliament, and called for his resignation.

Mr. Trump said he believed he had put impeachment behind him when the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, issued his report on the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. He now faces the genuine prospect of being the third president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.

Rather than compromise, however, both have dug in their heels, apparently calculating that an unsparing response will galvanize their political bases and allow them to ride out the current turmoil. In the process, they have used language that has stunned even those used to the cut-and-thrust of politics.

On Wednesday, Mr. Johnson said Britain should press ahead with Brexit to honor the memory of Jo Cox, a member of Parliament who was adamantly pro-European and was killed a week before the 2016 Brexit referendum by a right-wing assassin.

Mr. Trump told American diplomats he wanted to hunt down the officials who gave a whistle-blower information about his call with the Ukrainian president.

Lawyers Oversaw Handling of Ukraine Call Transcript, White House Says - The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/us/politics/nsc-ukraine-call.html,"Several current and former officials played down the significance of placing the classified calls into the secure system, saying it made sense to restrict the calls given the number of leaks from the Trump White House .

Nevertheless, the use of the system has come under scrutiny after the unclassified version of the whistle-blower complaint was made public. The complaint raised questions that the July 25 call with the Ukrainian president had been improperly placed in the classified system, suggesting that officials put the reconstructed transcript into a system meant to protect the nation’s most sensitive secrets.

The Trump administration said on Friday that National Security Council lawyers had made the decision to place the reconstructed transcript of that phone call into a highly classified computer system accessible to only a small number of officials.

“N.S.C. lawyers directed that the classified document be handled appropriately,” said a senior administration official. The statement was also first reported by CNN.

But the official did not actually say how the document was handled, nor address the whistle-blower’s specific charge that the reconstructed transcript, in what would be a highly unusual action, was moved from a computer system widely accessible to National Security Council officials to one reserved for those with code-word clearance to handle the country’s most closely guarded secrets like covert operations and foreign surveillance.

A White House spokesman did not respond when asked about that specific claim. Democrats in Congress and former N.S.C. officials and lawyers in both parties have said such an action, if motivated by a desire to conceal Mr. Trump’s efforts to put political pressure on the Ukrainian leader, would be far from appropriate, and at a minimum, unethical. But in a combative exchange with reporters later in the day, Kellyanne Conway, a White House counselor, repeated the spokesman’s language, saying that “as I understand, the document was handled appropriately at all times.”

“I think the most important thing about said document is that the whole world has access to it now,” Ms. Conway said, citing its release by the White House this week."

His planned appearance was to take place a week after the public release of a complaint filed by a whistle-blower alleging that Mr. Trump used the powers of his office to pressure officials in Ukraine for political dirt on former Vice President Joseph R.

But the whistle-blower’s stark, straightforward account of stupefying treachery deserves to be repeated as often as possible.

“In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,” the whistle-blower wrote. “This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president’s main domestic political rivals.

After the Ukrainian president described his need for more American assistance against Russia, Mr. Trump asked him to “do us a favor, though” and look into Democrats.

Mr. Volker was not on that call, and he was neither shown a copy of the transcript reconstructed from the conversation nor told that the president mentioned Mr. Biden, according to one person informed about the series of events. Mr. Volker participated in Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session this week in his last official duty.

“Kurt was one of the good ones who went in to the administration to stave off disaster,” said Thomas Wright, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “They all have to speak out now about everything they know and let the chips fall where they may.”

Mr. Volker, a former career foreign service officer who represented President George W. Bush at NATO and now serves as the executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University based in Washington, spent much of the year trying to bring Mr. Trump together with Mr. Zelensky to bolster the government elected in April.

He argued to Trump administration officials that Mr. Zelensky was a credible reformer and serious figure who could be his country’s last chance to get its act together in the face of Russian aggression. It was an uphill task, given Mr. Trump’s open disdain for Ukrainians; “they’re all corrupt and they tried to take me down,” he said in a private meeting last spring.

After the Ukrainian inauguration, Mr. Trump agreed to meet with Mr. Zelensky, but his staff kept delaying putting a date on the calendar. Like other officials, Mr. Volker was surprised to learn that Mr. Trump had ordered $391 million in aid to Ukraine frozen.

But he kept working to bring the two presidents together. Finally, the White House agreed to schedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky during the American president’s visit to Warsaw, only to scratch the meeting when Mr. Trump decided to stay home to monitor a hurricane."

Mr. Giuliani has been a ubiquitous presence on television news in recent days, advocating on Mr. Trump’s behalf. He has repeatedly alleged that Mr. Biden, while serving as vice president, intervened in Ukraine to assist his son Hunter Biden’s business interests. No evidence has surfaced that Mr. Biden intentionally tried to help his son in Ukraine.

The Biden campaign argued that Mr. Giuliani’s television appearances had allowed him to mislead the viewing public — and suggested that network journalists had done too little to hold him to account. “While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough,” the letter said.

Mr. Biden’s advisers have not been shy about offering advice to journalists . Earlier this month, the campaign sent a memo to an elite group of campaign reporters warning that any news story would be “misleading” if the Trump camp’s claims about Mr. Biden were unsubstantiated.

The news networks had no comment on Sunday.

As Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani remains a highly newsworthy figure, particularly amid an escalating impeachment inquiry in which Mr. Giuliani’s own actions in Ukraine could play a central role. It is likely that Mr. Giuliani will remain a coveted booking for television journalists seeking insight into the president’s mind-set and legal defense strategy.

As for Mr. Biden, he has shown little eagerness to engage one-on-one with TV anchors. The former vice president has declined to appear on any of the weekend political talk shows since declaring his candidacy, reserving his on-air appearances for late-night comedy shows, “The View” and a small number of other sit-downs."

“Donald Trump is terrified of Joe Biden because the Vice President would beat him like a drum,” she said.

No evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son in his work in Ukraine.

Mr. Biden’s return to the campaign trail on Friday represented the start of a critical and unpredictable phase of his presidential bid: He is now not only running to lead the Democrats against Mr. Trump in 2020, but he is also grappling with a national spotlight on his family, and how to handle questions — and any potential political fallout — associated with his role in the Ukraine story line that House Democrats are now investigating.

Mr. Trump has been regularly attacking Mr. Biden and his son over their dealings with Ukraine, often using innuendo and falsehoods. The president has also delivered deeply personal insults about Hunter Biden, seemingly trying to bait the elder Mr. Biden into retaliating.

How Mr. Biden handles Mr. Trump’s constant broadsides — as well as questions from reporters and voters about Ukraine, impeachment and his son’s business history — will be a significant test for the candidate who has topped polls for much of the primary race but has seen his lead dip recently.

“You have to be strategic and thoughtful about how you respond and when you respond and the nature of your response,” said the former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack, who attended a recent Biden fund-raiser but has not endorsed any candidate. “He has focused as much on the damage to the country, the concerns he has about misuse of power, as he has on the personal side of this.”"

Thomas P. Bossert, who served as Mr. Trump’s first homeland security adviser, said he told the president there was no basis to the theory that Ukraine, not Russia, intervened in the 2016 election and did so on behalf of the Democrats. Speaking out for the first time, Mr. Bossert said he was “deeply disturbed” that Mr. Trump nonetheless tried to get Ukraine’s president to produce damaging information about Democrats.

Mr. Bossert’s comments, on the ABC program “This Week” and in a subsequent telephone interview, underscored the danger to the president as the House moves ahead with an inquiry into whether he abused his power for political gain. Other former aides to Mr. Trump said on Sunday that he refused to accept reassurances about Ukraine no matter how many times it was explained to him, instead subscribing to an unsubstantiated narrative that has now brought him to the brink of impeachment.

The latest revelations came as the impeachment inquiry rushed ahead at a brisk pace. The House chairman taking the lead said that the whistle-blower who brought the matter to light would testify soon and that a subpoena for documents would be issued early this week to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer who spearheaded the effort to find dirt on Democrats in Ukraine. In a letter to the acting director of national intelligence, lawyers for the whistle-blower requested stepped-up efforts to ensure his safety, citing “serious concerns we have regarding our client’s personal safety.”"

Poroshenko was still the president of Ukraine earlier this year when his team sought a lifeline. With the polls showing him in clear danger of losing his re-election campaign, some of his associates, eager to hold on to their own jobs and influence, took steps that could have yielded a signal of public support from a vital ally: President Trump.

Over several weeks in March, the office of Ukraine’s top prosecutor moved ahead on two investigations of intense interest to Mr. Trump. One was focused on an oligarch — previously cleared of wrongdoing by the same prosecutor — whose company employed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son. The other dealt with the release by a separate Ukrainian law enforcement agency to the media of information that hurt Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign.

The actions by the prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, did not come out of thin air. They were the first visible results of a remarkable behind-the-scenes campaign to gather and disseminate political dirt from a foreign country, encouraged by Mr. Trump and carried out by his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. In the last week their engagement with Ukraine has prompted a formal impeachment inquiry into whether the president courted foreign interference to hurt a leading political rival.

The story of how Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani operated in Ukraine has emerged gradually in recent months. It was laid out in further detail in the past week in a reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump’s phone call this summer with a new Ukrainian president and in a complaint filed by a whistle-blower inside the United States government."

Both men consulted with Mr. Giuliani about his Ukraine project. On July 26, one day after Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Volker and Mr. Sondland met with Ukrainian officials and reportedly offered advice on how to “navigate” Mr. Trump’s requests. Did they, as the whistle-blower claims, at some point become concerned about Mr. Giuliani’s work and seek to “contain the damage”? Mr. Volker resigned his post on Friday. Why?

Mike Pence, vice president. In his conversations with Ukrainian officials, including his Sept. 1 meeting with Mr. Zelensky, was there any mention of Mr. Biden or of the delayed military funding package? When asked at a news conference on Sept. 2 if he could assure Ukraine that the two issues were not linked, Mr. Pence ducked the question. Mr. Pence should also explain why Mr. Trump directed him to cancel his plans to attend Mr. Zelensky’s inauguration in May.

Mr. Trump himself has suggested looking into Mr. Pence’s interactions with Ukrainian officials. “And I think you should ask for VP Pence’s conversation, because he had a couple conversations also,” he told reporters on Wednesday.

John Bolton, former national security adviser. Mr. Bolton was forced out of the White House in September. What did he know about Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign? Mr. Bolton is said to have pushed for the withheld military aid to be released. What explanation did he receive for it being withheld?

Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community. Mr. Atkinson reviewed the whistle-blower complaint, deemed it both “urgent” and “credible,” and forwarded it to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence. After Mr. Maguire declined to pass the complaint along to Congress, as indicated by federal law, Mr. Atkinson chose to alert lawmakers to its existence himself. What explanation did Mr. Maguire give for not forwarding the complaint? How did he respond when Mr. Atkinson informed him that he would be alerting Congress?

Lawmakers will also need to hear from whomever was charged with moving the transcript of Mr. Trump’s July 25 call from the usual computer system to the special server, maintained by the National Security Council, reserved for “classified information of an especially sensitive nature.” Who directed this action? (On Friday, a White House official told CNN that N.S.C. attorneys did so.) Who else knew about it? Did anyone object at the time? Have other such conversations been improperly stashed in the system, as the whistle-blower alleged? (It has been reported that reconstructed transcripts of phone calls Mr. Trump had with the Saudi royal family and with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, were stored on the server as well.) It’s worth remembering that one of the biggest bombshells of the Watergate hearings came from Alexander Butterfield, a relatively obscure administration staffer, who shared what he knew about the White House taping system.

Then there are the “multiple U.S. government officials” whom the whistle-blower cites as his sources — the ones whom Mr. Trump has compared to spies and has implied deserve to be executed for treason."

Mr. Giuliani has been a ubiquitous presence on television news in recent days, advocating on Mr. Trump’s behalf. He has repeatedly alleged that Mr. Biden, while serving as vice president, intervened in Ukraine to assist his son Hunter Biden’s business interests. No evidence has surfaced that Mr. Biden intentionally tried to help his son in Ukraine.

The Biden campaign argued that Mr. Giuliani’s television appearances had allowed him to mislead the viewing public — and suggested that network journalists had done too little to hold him to account. “While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough,” the letter said.

Mr. Biden’s advisers have not been shy about offering advice to journalists . Earlier this month, the campaign sent a memo to an elite group of campaign reporters warning that any news story would be “misleading” if the Trump camp’s claims about Mr. Biden were unsubstantiated.

The news networks had no comment on Sunday.

As Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani remains a highly newsworthy figure, particularly amid an escalating impeachment inquiry in which Mr. Giuliani’s own actions in Ukraine could play a central role. It is likely that Mr. Giuliani will remain a coveted booking for television journalists seeking insight into the president’s mind-set and legal defense strategy.

As for Mr. Biden, he has shown little eagerness to engage one-on-one with TV anchors. The former vice president has declined to appear on any of the weekend political talk shows since declaring his candidacy, reserving his on-air appearances for late-night comedy shows, “The View” and a small number of other sit-downs."

Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists.

Mr. Biden and other candidates will start announcing fund-raising results as early as Tuesday morning for the third quarter of 2019; he came in second for the last quarter, behind Pete Buttigieg, pulling in online money early but mostly relying on big donors.

Thomas P. Bossert, who served as Mr. Trump’s first homeland security adviser, said he told the president there was no basis to the theory that Ukraine, not Russia, intervened in the 2016 election and did so on behalf of the Democrats. Speaking out for the first time, Mr. Bossert said he was “deeply disturbed” that Mr. Trump nonetheless tried to get Ukraine’s president to produce damaging information about Democrats.

Mr. Bossert’s comments, on the ABC program “This Week” and in a subsequent telephone interview, underscored the danger to the president as the House moves ahead with an inquiry into whether he abused his power for political gain. Other former aides to Mr. Trump said on Sunday that he refused to accept reassurances about Ukraine no matter how many times it was explained to him, instead subscribing to an unsubstantiated narrative that has now brought him to the brink of impeachment.

The latest revelations came as the impeachment inquiry rushed ahead at a brisk pace. The House chairman taking the lead said that the whistle-blower who brought the matter to light would testify soon and that a subpoena for documents would be issued early this week to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer who spearheaded the effort to find dirt on Democrats in Ukraine. In a letter to the acting director of national intelligence, lawyers for the whistle-blower requested stepped-up efforts to ensure his safety, citing “serious concerns we have regarding our client’s personal safety.”"

Bolton, the former national security adviser, delivered a stark warning on Monday about President Trump’s approach to North Korea, undercutting the president’s insistence that its leader, Kim Jong-un, wanted to make a denuclearization deal with him.

Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Bolton said he wanted to “speak in unvarnished terms about the threat posed by North Korea,” and made it clear that he thought the president’s outreach to Mr. Kim had benefited only one side. And while Mr. Trump has made a deal with Mr. Kim one of his signature foreign policy goals, Mr. Bolton asserted that there had been no gains with his approach.

“The strategic decision Kim Jong-un is operating through is that he will do whatever he can to keep a deliverable nuclear weapons capability and to develop and enhance it further,” Mr. Bolton said during an appearance at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Under current circumstances, he will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily.”

Mr. Schiff, appearing on the ABC program “This Week,” said Sunday that the whistle-blower who triggered the inquiry would testify “very soon.”

But Mr. Schiff hinted the committee might not call Mr. Giuliani, the bombastic former New York mayor who was essentially running a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine on behalf of Mr. Trump. Interviewed on ABC shortly before Mr. Schiff, Mr. Giuliani at first said he “wouldn’t cooperate with Adam Schiff,” then said he “will consider it.”

Sunday night was only the latest effort by Ms. Pelosi to try to strike a dignified tone for the process with her appearance on “60 Minutes.” In a series of interviews, she has been making the case that Mr. Trump engaged in “a cover-up,” calling this moment a “sad day for our country.”

But the carefully coordinated messaging campaign may be upended before it starts. Liberals are reveling in news of an inquiry that they believe should have been opened long ago. The campaign of Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, whose profane cry for impeachment made news on her first day in office, is already selling T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan using a two-letter abbreviation for the expletive she used back in January.

And on the presidential campaign trail, Democrats are talking up impeachment, which poses a danger that the public will think the party is prejudging the outcome of the inquiry and politicizing a solemn task that has grave implications for the future of the nation.

“We need to make sure this is fact-driven and evidence-based, “ said Representative Josh Gottheimer, a centrist Democrat from New Jersey who had resisted calls for the inquiry until now. “You can’t prejudge something that is so solemn and obviously could have a big historical impact on our country, and you need to keep the country together.”

On Friday, three congressional committees issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, demanding that he produce documents and a slate of witnesses that could shed light on Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to pursue investigations into his political opponents, including Mr. Biden."

Both men consulted with Mr. Giuliani about his Ukraine project. On July 26, one day after Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Volker and Mr. Sondland met with Ukrainian officials and reportedly offered advice on how to “navigate” Mr. Trump’s requests. Did they, as the whistle-blower claims, at some point become concerned about Mr. Giuliani’s work and seek to “contain the damage”? Mr. Volker resigned his post on Friday. Why?

Mike Pence, vice president. In his conversations with Ukrainian officials, including his Sept. 1 meeting with Mr. Zelensky, was there any mention of Mr. Biden or of the delayed military funding package? When asked at a news conference on Sept. 2 if he could assure Ukraine that the two issues were not linked, Mr. Pence ducked the question. Mr. Pence should also explain why Mr. Trump directed him to cancel his plans to attend Mr. Zelensky’s inauguration in May.

Mr. Trump himself has suggested looking into Mr. Pence’s interactions with Ukrainian officials. “And I think you should ask for VP Pence’s conversation, because he had a couple conversations also,” he told reporters on Wednesday.

John Bolton, former national security adviser. Mr. Bolton was forced out of the White House in September. What did he know about Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign? Mr. Bolton is said to have pushed for the withheld military aid to be released. What explanation did he receive for it being withheld?

Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community. Mr. Atkinson reviewed the whistle-blower complaint, deemed it both “urgent” and “credible,” and forwarded it to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence. After Mr. Maguire declined to pass the complaint along to Congress, as indicated by federal law, Mr. Atkinson chose to alert lawmakers to its existence himself. What explanation did Mr. Maguire give for not forwarding the complaint? How did he respond when Mr. Atkinson informed him that he would be alerting Congress?

Lawmakers will also need to hear from whomever was charged with moving the transcript of Mr. Trump’s July 25 call from the usual computer system to the special server, maintained by the National Security Council, reserved for “classified information of an especially sensitive nature.” Who directed this action? (On Friday, a White House official told CNN that N.S.C. attorneys did so.) Who else knew about it? Did anyone object at the time? Have other such conversations been improperly stashed in the system, as the whistle-blower alleged? (It has been reported that reconstructed transcripts of phone calls Mr. Trump had with the Saudi royal family and with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, were stored on the server as well.) It’s worth remembering that one of the biggest bombshells of the Watergate hearings came from Alexander Butterfield, a relatively obscure administration staffer, who shared what he knew about the White House taping system.

Then there are the “multiple U.S. government officials” whom the whistle-blower cites as his sources — the ones whom Mr. Trump has compared to spies and has implied deserve to be executed for treason."

How private investors spoiled Uber and WeWork

This year has seen a number of high-profile I.P.O. flameouts, with Uber, Lyft and the home-exercise bike maker Peloton dropping below their debut prices and WeWork pulling its offering. The venture capitalist Fred Wilson argues that the reason is simple: Reality is setting in.

Mr. Wilson argues that these companies were spoiled by the private markets:

• Investors have been too eager to value many companies as software businesses, at 10 times revenues or more. “Now that narrative is falling apart,” Mr. Wilson writes.

• Uber’s gross margins were 46 percent, while WeWork’s were 20 percent. By comparison, Zoom, which makes videoconferencing software, has 81 percent gross margins.

• That disparity explains why Uber’s stock is down 33 percent from its I.P.O. price and WeWork’s stock sale fizzled — and Zoom’s stock has more than doubled since its debut."

President Trump was referring to statements made by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, during a congressional hearing last week about the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and the president of Ukraine. That call is part of a whistle-blower complaint that led Democrats to begin an impeachment hearing.

Mr. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not claim to be reciting from the reconstructed transcript of the call and said he was conferring “the essence” of the conversation, “shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words.” But he did speak in first person, leaving an impression that he was quoting Mr. Trump.

Later in the hearing, Mr. Schiff said that his “summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least part in parody.” Mr. Schiff described Mr. Trump’s side of the call as a “classic organized crime shakedown.” His account veered from the transcript in chronology and details at points, and seemed intended to put additional attention on the implication that Mr. Trump was demanding something from Ukraine in return for the assistance the United States had provided the country, but it generally tracked with the transcript’s version of what Mr. Trump said on the call.

“Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!” wrote Mr. Trump.

There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China, the other country Mr. Trump was alluding to in his tweet. The president has also urged China to look into the Bidens.

Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. He noted that his 2016 call to fire Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was part of United States government policy under President Barack Obama. It also reflected the wishes of a group of Republican senators at the time, who sought Mr. Shokin’s ouster because he was seen as unwilling to target corruption, Mr. Biden said.

A longtime senator before he became vice president, Mr. Biden is deferential to congressional prerogatives and has resisted calling for impeachment, even as Ms. Warren and many of his other Democratic rivals have been outspoken in demanding it.

Last month, when House Democrats began moving toward an impeachment inquiry, he said they should only do so if Mr. Trump did not cooperate with their investigation. Then last week he said he would let Congress “do its job on impeachment.” And at a later event on Wednesday, in Manchester, N.H., he nodded to his longstanding discomfort with impeachment, calling it “a God-awful thing for a nation to go through.”

But as Mr. Trump and his allies wage near-daily political warfare against Mr. Biden, he has sought to mount a counteroffensive.

He began his rebuttal in a speech last week in Reno, Nev., but on Wednesday he went even further.

Ms. Warren said she opposed Mr. Trump’s handling of the situation but believed the United States should “get out of the Middle East.” (Aides to Ms. Warren said she was referring to the withdrawal of troops from combat.)

Throughout the debate, which was sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, Mr. Biden played a far less central role than he did in the past, stepping to the foreground for exchanges over foreign policy but otherwise taking a more passive approach. His most important moment of the night may have come early on, when he was pressed by a moderator to explain why his son had not crossed any ethical lines by doing business in Ukraine while his father was overseeing diplomacy there for the Obama administration.

Mr. Biden said several times that he and his son had done “nothing wrong,” and alluded repeatedly to an interview Hunter Biden gave to ABC News, in which he said it had been an error in judgment to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while the elder Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption, often in false or exaggerated terms, and his efforts to enlist the government of Ukraine in tarring Mr. Biden instigated an impeachment inquiry.

Biden Jr. escalated his criticism of his most formidable rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, suggesting that she was not being forthright about the costs of her far-reaching policy proposals and questioning her “credibility.”

Mr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren’s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for “Medicare for all,” a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance. While other candidates are pouncing on that issue as well, Mr. Biden is under particular pressure because Ms. Warren has passed him in some national and early-state polls and joined him as a front-runner, a status he held alone for months.

“It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,” Mr. Biden said, addressing reporters on a cold, gray afternoon outside a union electrical trade center."

She dismissed as “fictitious” accusations that she had been disloyal to Mr. Trump, which she said had been circulated by allies of Mr. Giuliani.

Ms. Yovanovitch, testifying in defiance of State Department orders and at risk of losing her job, delivered a scathing indictment of how the Trump administration conducts foreign policy, warning that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats’ judgment and could undermine the nation’s interests.

Ms. Yovanovitch said of her time in Ukraine: “Our efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen. Sadly, someone was listening, and our nation is the worse off for that.”"

If his family intends to shun foreign business in the event that he becomes president — as Hunter Biden said he would on Sunday — voters may wonder why they didn’t do it far sooner, when Mr. Biden was conducting foreign diplomacy as vice president.

Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference — to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors a nd voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term.

“I’m a little worried about how Joe’s going to do if he were to get on a debate stage with the president, a little worried he’d be able to get him rattled,” said Tom Courtney, t he co-chairman of the Des Moines County Democrats in Iowa, a state where the Biden campaign has made substantial investments. “I would like to see him quit getting bogged down in little things. This guy has got way more experience than all the other candidates up there. He needs to take charge and show that.”"
253,Katie Glueck,"Last quarter, Mr. Biden pulled in$22 million, one of the biggest hauls in the field for that time period, though he still fell behind Mr. Buttigieg for that quarter.

Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer.

Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate.

“Look, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it’s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,” he said. “But I’ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.”

The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to “look into” Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son’s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump’s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden’s candidacy.

While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight — even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump’s focus on the Bidens.

That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president’s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden’s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued.

During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers."

WARREN: So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don’t even try because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money.

ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

WARREN: And repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight.

Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist who advised Mr. Sanders’s 2016 campaign but is not working for anyone in the 2020 race, said the lack of cash would limit Mr. Biden’s political options. He pointed to the variety of areas where campaigns might want to invest money: airing television ads, deploying staff on the ground, staging splashy but expensive events and running a robust digital program.

“Your strategic options are limited,” Mr. Devine said, adding that the options available to Mr. Biden’s better-funded rivals were “much bigger.”

“He’s going to have to place the right bet,” Mr. Devine said. “It’s going to have to be a winner. It’s almost like you’re playing roulette, and one guy gets five numbers and the other guy gets one number. Who’s going to win?”

Over the summer, Mr. Biden had already begun to slash his digital spending budget, which was also clear in the new fillings. He spent about $1 million in the first half of the quarter and about $311,000 in the second half, records show.

During the quarter, Mr. Biden also spent $924,000 on a charter jet company, Advanced Aviation Team, as he raced across the country not only for rallies and speeches but also for dozens of fund-raisers on both coasts. Mr. Biden’s campaign said the costs included paying for carbon offsets.

Mr. Biden’s biggest expense is his payroll, which cost about $6.8 million in the past three months, records show. Mr. Biden had roughly 440 people on his payroll — about as many as Mr. Buttigieg — while Ms. Warren had more than 600 and Mr. Sanders had about 550."

In both public remarks and private conversations with colleagues, Mr. Biden conveyed his discomfort with overturning the will of the voters, regardless of the executive transgression. He suggested that public opinion should be taken into consideration, even for senators who preferred to vote their conscience, since it was the choice of the electorate that lawmakers presumed to override.

“This. Is. Their. President,” he thundered at an event in November 1998 as President Bill Clinton’s fortunes rested with Congress, summarizing the view of Democratic voters whom Mr. Biden said he had met. “Don’t screw with him unless you have an overwhelming case that you can make that you’re being fair about it.”

And in an early signal of Mr. Biden’s deference to formal protocol, his experiences in the 1970s and 1990s seemed to crystallize the abiding faith in institutions — deep respect for the Senate, a reverence for process — that remains his hallmark, even as his current competitors suggest he is out of step with the crackling tribalism of the Trump era .

“He stuck with kind of an institutional approach to things, which he did for his whole career,” said Ted Kaufman, a longtime friend and aide who worked for Mr. Biden during Watergate and later succeeded him briefly as senator. “Let the system work.”

For a young lawmaker straining to find his way amid personal tragedy, the Nixon fracas was an early test of Mr. Biden’s defer-to-convention instincts and a jarring introduction to the capital. After his election in 1972, Mr. Biden had spoken to Mr. Nixon in an uncomfortable, minute-long courtesy phone call from the president after Mr. Biden’s wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash that December. (“I understand you were on the Hill at the time, and your wife was just driving by herself,” Mr. Nixon said, stammering for a few beats, according to a recording. “The main part is, you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory.”)"

In his decades-long public life, Mr. Trump has continually said things that shock (“Russia, if you’re listening …”). But today’s open request for China to investigate his political adversary still felt like new territory.

Maggie, why would he just blurt out that he wants China to investigate the Bidens?

He clearly knows something a wise person once said to me, which is that the value of a secret is its ability to be disclosed. So he tries to move the window of acceptability by publicly doing the very thing he is accused of doing in private.

What is it about his circumstances that might encourage him to make a request like this out loud?

He has led a consequence-free life despite enormously self-destructive behaviors over time. The divorces were marriages he wanted out of. The bankruptcies impacted his lenders most, not him. All of his behavior in 2016 ended with him winning the presidency. And the Mueller obstruction inquiry ended with no definitive answer.

Does his request this morning remind you of anything?

The period of time that is the most illuminating happened after the “Access Hollywood” tape came out. The next day, I wrote a story about Mr. Trump holed up at Trump Tower. He came downstairs sometime after 4 p.m. and went and immersed himself in a crowd of supporters who were outside on the street, and pumped his fist. The next day, he went to the debate in St. Louis and paraded Bill Clinton’s accusers in front of Hillary Clinton. It was the most savage thing I had ever seen anyone do in politics. And it underscored what Mr. Trump does when he is wounded."

Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now “dig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,” carrying his message from the debate — a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies — into the early states where he’s polling in fourth place.

Ms. Whaley said she expected Mr. Buttigieg, 37, to make a determined effort to displace Mr. Biden as the candidate seen as most capable of speaking to Midwesterners."

It’s not hard to imagine why Biden didn’t press Hunter. The Biden boys and their father had been through hell together. Hunter has said his first memory was waking up in the hospital next to his older brother, Beau, after the car crash that killed their mother and baby sister. He grew up to be a troubled man, his life pockmarked by addiction and failure.

Beau died of brain cancer a few months before Biden traveled to Ukraine to push the government to crack down on corruption. It’s not shocking that, at a moment when his family was consumed by grief, Biden wasn’t inclined to confront his surviving son.

But even if you’re not inclined to empathize with Biden — even if you assume the worst about him — Trump’s conspiracy theory makes no sense. To believe it, you’d have to first believe that the foreign affairs apparatus of the Obama administration was willing to put its credibility on the line in service of the black sheep of the Biden family. After all, Joe Biden wasn’t freelancing in Ukraine; he was carrying out White House policy.

Further, if the Trump administration truly believes that Obama’s Ukraine policy was crooked, one might ask why it has Pyatt, who helped accomplish that policy, representing America as ambassador to Greece.

Most important, getting rid of Shokin made an investigation of Burisma more likely, not less. “He didn’t want to investigate Burisma,” the Ukrainian anti-corruption activist Daria Kaleniuk told The Washington Post. “Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.”

However bad the optics around Hunter Biden, Joe Biden was not serving his son’s interests. If anything, they were working at cross-purposes."

But when Ms. Warren looked out at the audience, she saw mostly white faces. The view reflected perhaps her biggest political challenge as she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination: adding black voters to her base of support.

African-Americans were critical to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton winning competitive primary contests and capturing the nomination. Like those earlier candidates, Ms. Warren faces multiple rivals who may splinter the electorate this winter, and running up the vote margin in predominantly black areas could once again deliver troves of delegates needed for the nomination.

While Ms. Warren is rising in polls thanks to support among liberals, women, young people and college-educated whites, black voters, who are the most essential part of the traditional Democratic coalition, have yet to embrace her in large numbers."

I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.

BURNETT: Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?

BIDEN: Before the first vote.

BURNETT: Before Iowa?

BIDEN: Yes.

BURNETT: Not by the end of this year?

BIDEN: Well, before Iowa. I mean, look, I’ve released them before. I released 55 pages of my — I’m the only guy that’s released anything up here.

BURNETT: Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?

WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people’s lives, things like child care and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight."

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

Biden Jr. holding a position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

But the warning from George P. Kent, then a State Department officer stationed in Kiev, was not acted on, according to two people familiar with Mr. Kent’s testimony. Mr. Kent, now of the State Department’s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said he told the official that Hunter Biden’s position could look like a conflict of interest, given his father’s role, and would complicate American efforts to encourage Ukraine to clean up corruption.

The White House official told Mr. Kent that the elder Mr. Biden did not have the “bandwidth” to address the concerns while his older son, Beau, was undergoing cancer treatment, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the private deposition.

President Trump on Friday latched onto the rare bit of good news for him coming out of the House’s impeachment inquiry. Mr. Kent had also given Democrats plenty of fodder to drive their inquiry forward, but the emergence of any information that could tarnish the Bidens was welcome at the White House, even if White House officials have declared the inquiry illegitimate."

During both the opening stretch of the debate and subsequent ones, her prescriptions were the point of reference, her priorities set the terms of the discussion, and she was the candidate to whom the debate’s moderators kept returning so that she could respond to her rivals’ invocations of her.

And she stayed cool and confident under fire, sounding more grateful for the spotlight than fearful of the microscope. It was, for the most part, a fine performance.

But it was also, at first, an exasperating one. That unwillingness to talk candidly about middle-class taxes, though she was pressed by both a moderator and by other candidates to do so, bordered on perverse.

She kept saying, as if it were a tic or a stutter, that “costs will go down” for middle-class families, the translation of which is that taxes might well go up but that those families would be economically ahead of the game in the end.

If that’s the case, why not be explicit about the arithmetic and own it? If there’s nothing to hide from, why hide from it? Warren has campaigned as a truth teller but came across, in this instance, as a classically evasive Washington operator, scared to treat voters as grown-ups who can process information in a sophisticated manner."

Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February.

Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders’s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.

​“This will just raise the issue of his age​, which to me has always been the Achilles’ heel of the Sanders campaign,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. “When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.”

Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.

Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public colleges.

“He was only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass,” Mr. Trump said, a line that drew huge roars of approval from the crowd.

So it was insane and ineffective, which is the art of the deal.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “And you know, it’s funny, because on this very day on Oct. 16 — 57 years ago — the Cuban missile crisis started, and this letter from Trump is eerily similar to a letter J.F.K. sent Khrushchev when we found out the Soviets were putting nukes in Cuba. Well, he wrote, at that time: ‘Dear Premier Khrushchev, don’t be a [expletive], O.K.? Get your missiles out of Cuba. Everybody will say, ‘Yay, Cruise Ship!

Biden Jr. of blackmailing Ukrainian officials to stop an investigation of his son.

“Send Quid Pro Joe Biden into retirement,” a narrator in the ad intoned.

The video wasn’t released by the Trump campaign, which has produced ads on Facebook with similar accusations in recent weeks. Instead, it was made by an independent political action committee, or super PAC. And it was allowed to run on Facebook with false information, in violation of the social network’s policies on misinformation, the Biden presidential campaign wrote in a letter to Facebook on Thursday.

In the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, the Biden campaign acknowledged that Facebook had a policy of allowing all political leaders’ speech and ads to remain up because the company considers them to be newsworthy. But the ad by the super PAC was not from a politician, the Biden campaign wrote, so it needed to be rejected.

“This is a most basic test,” Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said in the letter. “The ad contains transparently false allegations, prominently debunked by every major media outlet in the country over recent weeks. It should be rejected.”"

So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

Many Democratic strategists and officials have warned that the scrutiny on the Biden family has become a significant distraction for the former vice president, and poses perhaps the greatest threat yet to a candidacy that until recent weeks was well ahead in the polls. That makes it all the more urgent for Mr. Biden to land the kind of consistently fluent, forceful debate performance that has so far eluded him at a moment when Senator Elizabeth Warren has now surpassed him in some polls, Democratic operatives and activists said.

“I’m never a distraction to my dad, but as it relates to actually going and being onstage with him — this is not a family business,” Hunter Biden said Tuesday in the ABC interview, which aired on “Good Morning America’’ and was also excerpted online by the network. “Everybody kind of thinks that somehow, whether it’s a compliment that we’re like the Kennedys or whether it’s a, you know, backhanded compliment like you’re the Trumps, my dad has a, a job, but that does not mean that I have had any plans to go do rallies and, you know and, you know, talk about Donald Trump’s kids and I never will, you know, that’s not what Bidens do.”

At a news conference on Sunday, however, his father did appear to take some oblique swipes at the ethical practices of members of the Trump family, some of whom who have conducted their own overseas business dealings. And Hunter Biden seemed to be dismissive of Donald Trump Jr., who along with his father and brother have been highly critical of the Bidens.

“Donald Prince Humperdinck, um, Trump, Jr., is not somebody I really care about,” he said, an apparent reference to a character in the movie “The Princess Bride.”

In the interview, Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father.

“I’m taking it off the table,” he said. “I’m making that commitment. Let’s see if anybody else makes that commitment. But that’s the commitment that I’m making.”"

For months, Ms. Warren had moved largely unimpeded in her brisk jog to the front of the 2020 Democratic pack, coasting through debates without incident as her calls for “big structural change” took hold and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. absorbed the unforgiving glare afforded the favorite. Time and again this year, moderators had invited Ms. Warren’s top competitors to attack her. Time and again, they had done so gently, if at all.

This time, Mr. O’Rourke went after her. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., did the same early in the evening in a slashing exchange on health care. Andrew Yang said she was wrong on the wealth tax. Senator Kamala Harris smiled as she and Ms. Warren sparred over whether to regulate President Trump’s tweets. Mr. Biden initiated his most direct debate-stage confrontation with Ms. Warren to date, saying she was “being vague” in campaign proposals.

This was Ms. Warren’s reward for achieving co-front-runner (and maybe outright front-runner) status: persistent sniping from fellow Democrats who see her surge as the most urgent threat to their own paths to the nomination. Ms. Warren greeted the deluge with mixed success, never wobbling too precariously but retreating at times to the safe harbor of stump-speech platitudes. On occasion, she appeared so eager to avoid the fray that she could give the impression that she was not engaging with the substance. “A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg observed at one point."

He also took what seemed to be veiled swipes at some of Mr. Trump’s children, who have had their own overseas business dealings.

“The statement my son put out today, which I saw when he put it out — I was told it was going to be put out, I did not consult with him about what’s being put out — in fact represents the kind of man of integrity he is,” Mr. Biden said. “ And I can tell you now, if I am your president, next president, I’m going to build on the squeaky-clean transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House, and no one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operation whatsoever. Period, end of story.”

Minutes later, he appeared to jab more sharply at members of the Trump family, a message that Mr. Biden, a Senate traditionalist who reveres beltway customs and civility, does not typically emphasize.

Joseph R.

But the former vice president at first did not address part of a question at the Democratic presidential debate from Anderson Cooper, who asked whether it was appropriate for his son to have business dealings in Ukraine while Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Biden instead pivoted to Mr. Trump, and invoked the founding fathers.

“My son did nothing wrong,” Mr. Biden said. “I did nothing wrong.”

He continued:

“Look, the fact that George Washington on the first time he spoke after being elected, that we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.”

Gregg Nunziata, a former counsel to Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, called it “bananas.” Walter Shaub, who resigned as head of the Office of Government Ethics in 2017 over the administration’s glaring lack of ethics, said that it “mistakes Trump for a king.”

Fortunately, Mr. Trump’s dreams of dominance tend to bump up against the hard realities of incompetence — his and that of his cronies. It has long been apparent that the president has a peculiar eye for talent. The repercussions of this were on display this week as the Ukraine scandal at the heart of the impeachment inquiry continued to unspool, spotlighting a fresh batch of colorful characters and questionable behavior.

In one of the more bizarre impeachment twists to date, two businessmen involved in the president’s efforts to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden were arrested on campaign finance violation charges as they were trying to leave the country on Wednesday. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are Soviet-born naturalized Americans who have been working closely with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, to investigate Mr. Biden, one of the president’s chief political rivals, and his son Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine. The men were also helping search for evidence to support a (debunked) conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine for the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee."

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

President George Bush was losing his re-election race, and they told him the only way to win was to hammer his challenger Bill Clinton’s patriotism for protesting the Vietnam War while in London and visiting Moscow as a young man.

Mr. Bush was largely on board with that approach. But what came next crossed the line, as far as he and his team were concerned. “They wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton’s trip to Moscow,” James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush’s White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo later that day. “I said we absolutely could not do that.”

President Trump insists he and his attorney general did nothing wrong by seeking damaging information about his domestic opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and Britain or by publicly calling on China to investigate his most prominent Democratic challenger. But for every other White House in the modern era, Republican and Democratic, the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage was seen as unwise and politically dangerous, if not unprincipled.

A survey of 10 former White House chiefs of staff under Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama found that none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds."

Oct. 11, 2019

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election."

(Mr. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the first place because of his request to the Ukrainian government that it look into what Mr. Biden did with the country’s officials when his son, Hunter Biden, was working for a gas company there.)

At the same time, others like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful to endorse only the impeachment inquiry and not necessarily impeachment itself.

Below is a partial transcript of the exchange on impeachment at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You’re all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach? Please respond."

That’s how the contenders for the party’s nomination framed the recent withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria under President Trump, who they said during Tuesday night’s debate had created turmoil with his impulsive foreign policy decision making.

“It’s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party’s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage.

It followed Mr. Trump’s decision this month to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, one that has been sharply criticized by Republicans and now Democrats, who said it would endanger Kurdish allies in the region. Mr. Trump said he was trying to “end the endless wars.”"

Watching without access to polling data, you might have imagined that this was some sort of wild careening mess of a primary race, when really it’s remarkably consolidated.

There is a Joe Biden constituency that seems stable at around 30 percent of the primary electorate. There is an Elizabeth Warren constituency that has expanded swiftly enough, especially in early states, to make her arguably the front-runner. There is a Bernie Sanders constituency that is about two-thirds the size of Warren’s and Biden’s peak and seemingly stuck there. And then, way down at around 5 percent and under, there is everybody else.

So a big question in this debate and in the ones before Iowa arrives and the also-rans begin to be formally run out is whether Democratic voters can be persuaded to reconsider this consolidation. And last night there were only really two candidates who presented themselves as plausible vehicles for that reconsideration: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.

As for the others — well, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are too niche, Beto O’Rourke is too limp, Julián Castro is too forgettable and Tom Steyer is too absurd. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker should be contenders, but Booker manages to be appealing at every debate without quite finding a rationale for his candidacy, while Harris has been on a weird self-destruct mission ever since her brief ascent — with her strange fight with Warren last night over whether Twitter should ban Donald Trump a particularly peculiar self-charted nose-dive."

The fund-raising announcement comes as Mr. Sanders’s campaign begins a crucial phase of his presidential bid. He and his advisers had tried for months to portray the race as a battle between Mr. Sanders and Joseph R. Biden Jr., but the surge of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, has scrambled that strategy. The top tier of candidates in the field has narrowed faster than his advisers expected, complicating matters: Rather than competing for the nomination with a half dozen candidates, he is essentially battling just two right now — Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren."

This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health,” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

Mr. Volker replied: “That’s the clear message so far …”

Under questioning on Capitol Hill, Mr. Volker told House Democratic investigators that the language including specific references to Burisma and the 2016 election had come from Mr. Giuliani, the person familiar with his testimony said.

Mr. Volker told the House investigators that the Ukrainians had earlier proposed language promising a statement on fighting corruption that did not specifically mention Burisma and 2016. When Mr. Giuliani was shown that original language, Mr. Volker told the House, he indicated to Mr. Volker that it was not sufficient and said the Ukrainians should be asked for specific public commitments to investigate Burisma and 2016.

By Mr. Volker’s account, according to the person familiar with his testimony, he was eventually told by Mr. Yermak that the Ukrainian government could not agree to the language being sought by Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Volker told Mr. Yermak that he was right, and the idea was dropped, according to the account Mr. Volker provided the House.

The idea behind the statement was to break the Ukrainians of their habit of promising American diplomats and leaders behind closed doors that they would look into matters and never follow through, the people briefed on it said. According to the account provided by Mr. Volker to the House, the idea of the Ukrainians providing a statement had originated with Mr. Giuliani in a conversation he had with Mr. Yermak.

It is unclear if the statement was delivered to Mr. Zelensky, but no statement was released publicly under his name. Around that time, the Ukrainian officials indicated to the Americans that they wanted to avoid becoming more deeply enmeshed in American politics.

The drafting of the statement, which came in the weeks after the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, was an effort to pacify Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani and to normalize relations between the two countries as Ukraine faced continuing conflict with Russia. Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker believed that Mr. Giuliani was “poisoning” Mr. Trump’s mind about Ukraine and that eliciting a public commitment from Mr. Zelensky to pursue the investigations would induce Mr. Trump to more fully support the new Ukrainian government, according to the people familiar with it."

The indictment of the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, sketched a complex scheme to violate campaign finance laws and did not accuse Mr. Trump of wrongdoing. But it revealed new details about the push to pressure Ukraine: a campaign encouraged by Mr. Trump, led by his private lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and assisted by obscure figures like Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman.

Mr. Trump continues to defend the effort, which is the focus of the impeachment inquiry that House Democrats opened last month. The new indictment, however, suggests the first criminal implications of the shadow foreign policy that Mr. Giuliani pushed on behalf of the president.

And it is another example of the extent to which the messy power dynamics of Ukraine — a former Soviet republic and close American ally with a recent history of political upheaval — now dominate discussions about Mr. Trump’s future.

Republicans are attacking Warren

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became “visibly pregnant” at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her.

This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting — and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread.

The candidates talked L.G.B.T.Q. rights

CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder.

You can read about the forum here.

Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president."

In this race’s early stages, Ms. Harris showed all the signs of a possible coalition candidate, merging liberals and more moderate minority voters behind the strength of her historic bid to become the country’s first woman of color elected president. On the race’s first day, she raised $1.5 million, and she soon held a kickoff rally in Oakland, Calif., that remains one of the largest events for any candidate, with more than 20,000 people in attendance.

However, as the race has matured, Ms. Harris has been outflanked in money and ideology. Mr. Buttigieg has become the favorite of big money donors, and advisers for Mr. Biden, the race’s most prominent moderate candidate, are now considering a super PAC to supplement his coffers.

On the grass-roots side, progressives have centralized behind their two preferred candidates: Mr. Sanders, who retains many supporters from his previous presidential run, and Ms. Warren, who has grown her fund-raising base as her poll numbers have risen. She has outpaced Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in recent polls, both nationally and in a few early-voting states.

Ms. Harris’s team is adamant that she remains well-positioned — and adequately funded — to mount a vigorous operation in Iowa. As Mr. Biden’s poll numbers fade, Ms. Harris’s advisers believe her campaign is likely to gain from this and can use a strong initial showing to centralize black voters in later states. Recently, Ms. Harris shook up her senior staff, in a move that was first reported by Politico, and was taken as an acknowledgment of the campaign’s tough road ahead."

Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.

And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.

That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.

Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”

Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.

But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.

The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person."

Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, demanded that Ukraine specifically commit to investigate involvement in the 2016 election and a firm tied to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

During testimony behind closed doors on Thursday, the special envoy, Kurt D. Volker, said Mr. Giuliani rejected a generic draft statement that Ukraine’s government had agreed to issue committing to fighting corruption generally. Instead, Mr. Giuliani said the Ukrainians had to promise to pursue two specific investigations that could damage the president’s political domestic adversaries.

While Mr. Giuliani’s efforts to pressure Ukraine have been known, Mr. Volker’s account to House committees conducting an impeachment inquiry provides new details about how the president’s personal lawyer inserted himself into foreign policy to benefit Mr. Trump politically. Not only was Mr. Giuliani meeting with Ukrainian officials, he was effectively dictating the contents of a statement being negotiated by State Department officials with a foreign power.

Mr. Giuliani “said that in his view, the statement should include specific reference to ‘Burisma’ and ‘2016,’” Mr. Volker told the House investigators, according to a copy of his prepared testimony provided by a person involved in the process who did not want to be named. “There was no mention of Vice President Biden in these conversations.”"

The forum, sponsored by two gun control organizations and MSNBC, was intended as a platform for a policy discussion — but it quickly became an outlet for rising anxiety among Democrats who fear the country has grown numb to mass shootings, like the ones that took place during a single August weekend in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio.

“It’s not an intellectual issue,” said Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, speaking to an audience that included the families of some shooting victims. “This is living with a sense of urgency. We cannot wait. This is no time for an impotence of empathy. We cannot wait until this hell is upon your community for you to be activated in this fight.”

Now he is caught in the middle of a domestic one . He will be pressed to explain what he knew — after acknowledging that he listened in on a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky — and how he reacted when he heard his boss seek political help.

“I was on the phone call,” he said Wednesday, but ignored a question about what he thought about Mr. Trump’s requests.

That admission was a marked change. In interviews in recent weeks, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly evaded questions about the content of the call between the two presidents, and never volunteered that he had listened in.

In an interview on Sept. 22, days before the White House released a transcript of the call, Mr. Pompeo suggested that he was unaware of the details, telling Martha Raddatz of ABC that he had not seen the whistle-blower report and then describing American policy toward Ukraine in traditional terms, without reference to the favors Mr. Trump sought.

The Benghazi hearings that first brought national attention to Mr. Pompeo, then a conservative congressman from Kansas, investigated systematic security failings after four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed in an attack on a diplomatic outpost and a nearby C.I.A. annex in 2012. The two-year congressional inquiry — one of the most bitterly partisan in history — concluded that the State Department and the C.I.A. did not appreciate the high security risk in Benghazi, but found no evidence that Mrs. Clinton was directly to blame.

Like the Benghazi hearings, the impeachment proceedings, opened last week by House Democrats, are as immersed in diplomacy as they are in political intrigue. In recent days Mr. Pompeo’s role in the Ukraine chain of events has become increasingly clearer — and ever closer to the center of the controversy."

Seven in 10 Democratic voters support mandatory buybacks, according to an August Quinnipiac poll, although less than half of all voters do.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs. Among Democrats, it’s a particularly winning concept; 86 percent of Democrats nationwide back the Green New Deal, the poll found."

“A yes-or-no question that did not get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg said, adding, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.” He rattled off how her plan would “obliterate” the private health insurance of 150 million Americans while pitching his “Medicare for all who want it” alternative.

Mr. Buttigieg’s rebuke of Mr. O’Rourke — “I don’t need lessons from you on courage” — may lend itself more to a viral moment. But the bigger leap was to be seen as a foil to Ms. Warren.

The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.”

But in his earlier remarks to reporters, Mr. Mulvaney pointed to “three issues” that explained why officials withheld the aid: corruption in Ukraine, frustration that European governments were not providing more money to Ukraine and the president’s demand that Kiev officials investigate the issue of the Democratic National Committee server.

“Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the D.N.C. server?” Mr. Mulvaney said, referring to Mr. Trump. “Absolutely. No question about that.” He added, “That’s why we held up the money.”

Democrats ridiculed the reversal.

“Mick Mulvaney was either lying then, or he’s lying now,” said Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat involved in the inquiry. “I think he’s lying now.”

At the White House, staff members recognized that Mr. Mulvaney had created an entirely new controversy with his remarks. Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers, said Thursday, “The president’s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s press briefing.”

Mr. Mulvaney’s performance was only part of another extraordinary day in Mr. Trump’s presidency. Mr. Mulvaney made his remarks after he stepped before the cameras to announce that the leaders of the Group of 7 nations would meet in June at Mr. Trump’s golf resort in South Florida, even as he acknowledged the choice could be seen as self-enrichment. In Texas, Mr. Trump hailed a Middle East cease-fire that would cement Turkey’s goal of pushing Kurds from Northern Syria as “a great day for civilization.”

And on Capitol Hill, Gordon D. Sondland, the president’s ambassador to the European Union and a wealthy donor to Mr. Trump’s campaign, was implicating the president in the Ukraine scandal by telling lawmakers that Mr. Trump had delegated Ukraine policy to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani."

She is the author, with Clifford Gaddy, of “Mr. Putin,” a critical biography of the Russian leader, and she was appointed senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs on the National Security Council staff in 2017. She turned over her duties to her successor on July 15 and left on July 19, just days before the July 25 call.

For much of her tenure, Ms. Hill found herself caught in the middle, a noted skeptic of Mr. Putin working for a president who valued his friendship with the Russian leader. She came under fire from some of the most conservative figures and news media outlets around Mr. Trump, which portrayed her as an enemy within, even as some of her longtime friends and colleagues expressed disapproval that she had gone to work for the president in the first place.

One of the most dramatic moments she described came in the July 10 meeting in Mr. Bolton’s office that included Mr. Sondland; Kurt D. Volker, then the special envoy for Ukraine; Rick Perry, the energy secretary; and two Ukrainian officials.

The purpose of the meeting was to talk about technical assistance to Ukraine’s national security council. The Ukrainians were eager to set up a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, who was elected on a promise to clean up corruption and resolve the country’s five-year war with Russian-armed separatists.

Mr. Bolton was trying to not commit to a meeting, according to Ms. Hill’s testimony. Mr. Sondland got agitated, Ms. Hill testified, and let out that there was an agreement with Mr. Mulvaney that there would be a meeting if Ukraine opened up the investigations the White House was seeking.

Mr. Bolton immediately ended the meeting abruptly. As the group moved toward the door, Mr. Sondland said he wanted them to come down to the ward room next to the White House mess to discuss next steps. Mr. Bolton pulled Ms. Hill aside to instruct her to go to the ward room and report to him what they talked about.

The question ever since has been whether Volodymyr Zelensky, the comedian who played Mr. Holoborodko and now leads Ukraine, is indeed the idealistic, modest and scrupulously honest corruption-buster whose guiding thought as president is: “One should act in a way that doesn’t evoke shame when looking into children’s eyes. Or their parents’. Or yours.”

The infamous reconstructed transcript of Mr. Zelensky’s telephone conversation with President Trump does evoke embarrassment. The Ukrainian enthusiastically demeans himself before Mr. Trump, calling him a “great teacher,” joining him in trashing European leaders, bad-mouthing the American ambassador Mr. Trump fired for all the wrong reasons and pledging to work on the investigations that Mr. Trump was seeking for his own political ends. He also notes that he stayed in one of Mr. Trump’s hotels the last time he was in the United States.

But whether that performance was Mr. Zelensky revealing his real self or his Holoborodko character colliding with rude reality is a tough call. Ukraine, as Mr. Zelensky has noted, is fighting two wars — one against entrenched corruption fueled by a coterie of oligarchs, the other against rebel secessionists in eastern Ukraine propped up by Russia."

The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.”

But in his earlier remarks to reporters, Mr. Mulvaney pointed to “three issues” that explained why officials withheld the aid: corruption in Ukraine, frustration that European governments were not providing more money to Ukraine and the president’s demand that Kiev officials investigate the issue of the Democratic National Committee server.

“Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the D.N.C. server?” Mr. Mulvaney said, referring to Mr. Trump. “Absolutely. No question about that.” He added, “That’s why we held up the money.”

Democrats ridiculed the reversal.

“Mick Mulvaney was either lying then, or he’s lying now,” said Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat involved in the inquiry. “I think he’s lying now.”

At the White House, staff members recognized that Mr. Mulvaney had created an entirely new controversy with his remarks. Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers, said Thursday, “The president’s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s press briefing.”

Mr. Mulvaney’s performance was only part of another extraordinary day in Mr. Trump’s presidency. Mr. Mulvaney made his remarks after he stepped before the cameras to announce that the leaders of the Group of 7 nations would meet in June at Mr. Trump’s golf resort in South Florida, even as he acknowledged the choice could be seen as self-enrichment. In Texas, Mr. Trump hailed a Middle East cease-fire that would cement Turkey’s goal of pushing Kurds from Northern Syria as “a great day for civilization.”

Ergo, the more governments that Mr. Trump urges to do the same thing, the more normal, if not public-spirited, such aberrant presidential behavior will seem. The cynical marketing calculation — Mr. Trump’s favorite form of math — would seem to be that, as with previous administration outrages, the news media will grow weary, the public will grow numb, the Democratic inquisitors will appear ineffectual. Mr. Trump is also, of course, seeking to drag former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, down to his level and implicate them in the same kind of self-dealing that he and his own family stand accused of.

This might work. But it also might not. There is no historical precedent for a president demanding that a foreign government investigate another American politician. If Mr. Trump has evidence of possible corruption overseas, his counsel should relay it to the Department of Justice and let the F.B.I. do its job, in coordination with its foreign counterparts.

Instead, Mr. Trump used his telephone conversation with Mr. Zelensky to pressure him to do Mr. Trump a “favor” and consult with Rudy Giuliani, serving as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer and unofficial envoy, and the attorney general, William Barr, about digging up dirt on the Bidens. At that time, the United States, under direct orders from the president, was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid appropriated by Congress to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian encroachment on its eastern border.

Much remains unknown about how the various dots do or do not connect. But basic facts of the Ukraine approach are not in dispute. Nor can there be much question about what Mr. Trump so publicly asked China to do.

There is a certain twisted logic to the president’s approach.

He lifted a block on its delivery in September only under intense bipartisan pressure from Congress, where lawmakers view the money as vital to combating Russia’s armed aggression in the region.

The White House has denied that the aid was being withheld to exert leverage over the Ukrainians, but at least one senior diplomat worried privately that that was precisely what was happening, and the administration has been unwilling to answer questions about the timeline and rationale for the decision. Regardless of the reasoning, the decision to withhold aid that was allocated by Congress on a bipartisan basis prompted confusion and concern within the State and Defense Departments, which were responsible for delivering the money, as well as among lawmakers in both parties who had a hand in allocating it.

Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry in the House suspect the actions may be related. They point to comments in early September by Vice President Mike Pence, who said publicly that a review of the funds was based on White House concerns about “issues of corruption.”

“The enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House’s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,” read the letters accompanying the subpoenas, signed by Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee; Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee; and Representative Eliot L. Engel, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

The Defense Department had been anticipating a subpoena. Last week, the Pentagon’s general counsel directed all department heads to collect and turn in all documents and material related to military aid to Ukraine.

“As we’ve stated previously, we are prepared to work with Congress and other relevant parties on questions related to the issue of Ukrainian aid as appropriate,” Lt. Col. Carla M. Gleason, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said on Monday.

The budget office did not reply to a request for comment. The House Appropriations and Budget Committees are reviewing some documents produced by the budget office in response to a separate request the two committees sent in late September about the delay in the foreign aid, aides said on Monday."

Mr. Zelensky, whose political party is called Servant of the People, abandoned the journalists and his exasperated press secretary and went over to hear the women out, ordering his aides to take down their information and determine how to address their concerns.

The scene unfolded in the course of a daylong news conference that Mr. Zelensky hosted at a food court in central Kiev, part of an effort to take back control of his narrative and refocus attention on domestic priorities amid the firestorm surrounding his interactions with President Trump.

This is not where Mr. Zelensky expected to be when he took office last May. A popular comedian and actor, who played a president on TV before he entered the race for Ukraine’s actual presidency last year, Mr. Zelenksy had anticipated becoming embroiled in ferocious battles with Ukraine’s oligarchs over endemic corruption and going head-to-head with Russia’s president, Vladimir V.

Thanks to a nearly $25 million fund-raising bounty in the spring, which he topped up with a respectable $19.1 million over the summer, as reported Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg has been able to invest in a gold-plated ground game in Iowa as he seeks to challenge two candidates who have been organizing for longer here, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .

Grass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night.

The indictment of the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, sketched a complex scheme to violate campaign finance laws and did not accuse Mr. Trump of wrongdoing. But it revealed new details about the push to pressure Ukraine: a campaign encouraged by Mr. Trump, led by his private lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and assisted by obscure figures like Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman.

Mr. Trump continues to defend the effort, which is the focus of the impeachment inquiry that House Democrats opened last month. The new indictment, however, suggests the first criminal implications of the shadow foreign policy that Mr. Giuliani pushed on behalf of the president.

And it is another example of the extent to which the messy power dynamics of Ukraine — a former Soviet republic and close American ally with a recent history of political upheaval — now dominate discussions about Mr. Trump’s future. The impeachment inquiry began after a C.I.A. officer who has worked at the White House raised alarms about a July telephone call in which Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that American military aid was contingent on Ukraine’s help in unearthing information that could help Mr. Trump politically."

He also paused at one point to interview Little League ballplayers about their pitching speeds.

The two biggest disasters in Trump’s presidency have both been cases where these guardrails collapsed, and the president actually got his way in full. He actually fired James Comey, setting in motion the probe whose workings dominated his first term, and his Homeland Security apparatus actually separated thousands of migrant children from their families, creating the biggest moral scandal of his presidency.

But in other cases he has been protected by the “don’t-give-him-the-alligator” operations all around him. Indeed, the ultimate fizzle of the Mueller report was possible because that report ended up documenting a president whose staff let him rant about obstructing justice, but then — in Mueller’s own words — mostly “declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”

With the Ukraine scandal, though, this protection has broken down again. (Not least because in Rudy Giuliani, Trump found an adviser even more enthusiastic about alligators than his boss.) The quest to get Ukraine’s government to reopen an investigation that would touch the Biden family wasn’t just a wish that Trump expressed; it was a policy objective that, however reluctantly and haphazardly, the U.S. government seems to have pursued. Trump’s now-publicized conversation with the Ukrainian president was itself an act of foreign policy, not just a spitballing conversation, and, whatever its intentions, so was the delay of military aid. We can’t see the full body of the alligator, but you can see it moving in the water; it’s right there.

Now clearly people around Trump still believed that they weren’t going all the way to Alligatortown with Rudy, and maybe when we see the full shape of things it will be clear that the president’s men did actually prevent the most explicitly Biden-focused quid pro quo from taking shape. In which case there will be defenses of Trump that say, in effect: Look, he wanted an alligator, and we let one thrash around in the water for a while, but we always kept it on a leash.

I expect that will be the defense offered, eventually, by pained Republican senators voting to acquit — that this was bad behavior but happily the president’s diplomats kept things from reaching the level of an impeachable offense.

The only difficulty will be that Trumpland will probably spend the next few months making a different argument: Actually, alligators are great.

The United States won’t get Iran to the table without some economic relief — either directly or through the European Union, as President Emmanuel Macron of France has suggested. The United States will also need to abandon as a precondition for progress the 12 demands that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid out publicly last year. This hard-bitten and resourceful Iranian regime is not going to issue that kind of declaration of surrender.

The Iranians will have to get more realistic, too. It is simply impractical to think that the United States will provide significant sanctions relief without assurances that Iran will immediately begin negotiations on a follow-on agreement that at least extends the timelines of the deal and addresses issues of verification and intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif recently signaled some openness to negotiation of additional terms. While we should have no illusions about how difficult that would be, we should certainly test the proposition. The Iranians have known since the secret talks that we saw this as an iterative process, like other arms control processes, in which one agreement became a foundation stone for further negotiations. The nuclear deal agreed to in 2015 was meant to be the beginning, not the end, of diplomacy with Iran.

Both sides should also seek to reduce tensions more broadly. It is long past time to secure the release of Americans detained, deeply unfairly, in Iran. It is time to stop threats to vital shipping lanes, and stop making Iraq a battleground for American-Iranian competition. We should make an opportunity of the crisis in the gulf and push hard to end the war in Yemen. That conflict is not only a humanitarian tragedy of epic proportion but also a strategic calamity for our gulf partners and a stain on American foreign policy. Afghanistan is another issue to discuss directly, given Iran’s stake in stability there, and Tehran’s ability to disrupt it.

If you asked us to propose a path for diplomacy with Iran, we’d suggest not starting from where we are today.

But we are where we are, and we know where we’re headed, especially given the surplus of mutual enablers in both Tehran and Washington. We have our last, best chance for diplomacy before us. We should seize it.

Bolton, the former national security adviser, delivered a stark warning on Monday about President Trump’s approach to North Korea, undercutting the president’s insistence that its leader, Kim Jong-un, wanted to make a denuclearization deal with him.

Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Bolton said he wanted to “speak in unvarnished terms about the threat posed by North Korea,” and made it clear that he thought the president’s outreach to Mr. Kim had benefited only one side. And while Mr. Trump has made a deal with Mr. Kim one of his signature foreign policy goals, Mr. Bolton asserted that there had been no gains with his approach.

“The strategic decision Kim Jong-un is operating through is that he will do whatever he can to keep a deliverable nuclear weapons capability and to develop and enhance it further,” Mr. Bolton said during an appearance at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Under current circumstances, he will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily.”

Mr. Bolton was pushed out from his job as Mr. Trump’s third national security adviser less than a month ago amid disputes over how to handle major foreign policy challenges, including North Korea."

Ultimately, that was what happened. The Justice Department, which was led at the time by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, did not see merit in deporting Mr. Gulen, said one former official familiar with the matter.

Throughout 2017, before Mr. Giuliani began representing Mr. Trump as his personal lawyer, he appeared at the White House to discuss a number of issues related to Turkey, according to two former administration officials. At one point, officials tried to divert Mr. Giuliani’s access to the president so that he was raising his issues with the president’s senior advisers instead of Mr. Trump directly.

Also on Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani’s lawyer, Jon A. Sale, said in a letter to the House Intelligence Committee that he would not hand over documents to the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry because the information requested was “beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry” and a violation of attorney-client and executive privilege.

In a confrontational tweet that echoed the president’s condemnation of the investigations, Mr. Giuliani said he “will not participate in an illegitimate, unconstitutional, and baseless ‘impeachment inquiry.’”

Mr. Giuliani appeared to reject the idea that his decision to defy the subpoena would place him in any legal jeopardy. He said in his tweet that Mr. Sale would no longer be representing him on impeachment matters.

“At this time, I do not need a lawyer,” Mr. Giuliani wrote.

A spokeswoman for the committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Giuliani’s letter.

Mr. Giuliani has emerged as the central character in the monthslong effort by Mr. Trump and officials in his government to get Ukraine’s president to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading Democratic candidate for president, and his son Hunter Biden."

The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather.

Kissing babies and tousling children’s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops . In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning."

Three Democratic chairmen leading the inquiry instructed Mr. Perry to turn over by next Friday any records that would shed light on President Trump’s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government to open corruption investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son. Investigators also want answers on whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine’s state-owned gas company.

Hours earlier, they demanded that two businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, appear for depositions next Wednesday and hand over records related to their work with Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. Mr. Giuliani has been the point man in the president’s pressure campaign on Ukraine, around which the inquiry is centered. The subpoenas came shortly after the two men were indicted on federal campaign finance charges that touched on their work in Ukraine.

The new subpoenas, and more in the works, sent a clear message to the White House that Democrats do not intend to back down from a growing constitutional clash over their inquiry, even after the White House defiantly said this week that it would stonewall all requests for witnesses and documents."

For the third consecutive night, Mr. Trump delivered a version of his combative response to the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry declared last month by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, this time during an official presidential speech at the Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of social conservatives in Washington.

“I think she hates our country,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Pelosi. “If she didn’t hate our country, she wouldn’t be doing this to our country. It’s a fraud.” After months of restraint, Ms. Pelosi last month charged Mr. Trump with betraying the nation’s security by seeking to enlist a foreign government to damage a political rival for his own gain.

Mr. Trump’s remarks came after two nights of raucous campaign rallies, one in the progressive city of Minneapolis, and another in the deep-red district of Lake Charles, La.

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

Mr. Kent’s testimony followed a pattern that has emerged among recent witnesses. The State Department directed Mr. Kent not to appear and sought to limit his testimony, according to officials familiar with the investigation. But the House Intelligence Committee issued a last-minute subpoena, and he complied.

Tuesday was the document deadline for Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Giuliani, the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Pence and the O.M.B. rejected the requests. A lawyer for Mr. Giuliani sent a letter to House officials saying that Mr. Giuliani would not comply with the subpoena he was issued.

How this impeachment is different

Investigators this week are calling in witnesses who aren’t typically part of the Washington news cycle: a former Russia specialist on the National Security Council, the ambassador to the European Union, a deputy assistant secretary of defense.

The range of voices puts this impeachment investigation in new historical territory, according to Philip Bobbitt, a professor at Columbia Law School and a co-author with Charles Black of “Impeachment: A Handbook.”

The Clinton impeachment had little to do with governance, Mr. Bobbit told me.

“It had nothing to do with foreign policy or defense policy,” he said. “And in Nixon’s case, there were maybe a couple of dozen people involved.”

The inquiry so far has leaned on witness depositions in addition to traditional evidentiary material like transcripts, which were a mainstay for investigators organizing the case against President Richard Nixon."

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , two associates of Rudy Giuliani , were indicted on campaign finance charges. They were part of the pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate President Trump ’s political rivals, including Joe Biden .

Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York said Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman “conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office,” including by making donations to a pro-Trump super PAC. Read the indictment.

The indictment refers to a “Congressman-1” — identified in campaign finance filings as former Representative Pete Sessions , Republican of Texas — who was the beneficiary of approximately $3 million that the super PAC spent during the 2018 cycle. The men sought Mr. Sessions’s assistance in removing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, “at least in part at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,” according to the indictment. (The men were also seeking political assistance setting up a legal marijuana business in Nevada.)

Shortly after the indictment became public, House impeachment investigators issued subpoenas to Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, compelling them to speak with Congress about their work with Mr. Giuliani in Ukraine.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry was subpoenaed for records that could shed light on any role he may have played in Mr. Trump’s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government. Investigators also want to know whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine’s state-owned gas company.

A dramatic airport arrest

Katie Benner, who covers the Justice Department for us, said federal prosecutors probably had the indictment ready to go for a while and were keeping tabs on Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. When the two got one-way tickets out of the country, she said, the prosecutors realized that they had to move.

My colleague Mike Schmidt got an eyewitness account of the arrests in the Lufthansa lounge in the B concourse of Dulles International Airport on Wednesday. Here’s what he heard:

They were indulging themselves in the free drinks and food while talking on the phone and waiting for their overnight flight to Frankfurt. Around 5:45 p.m., the men and the other first class travelers were invited to board before all the other passengers. As they made their way down a corridor toward their plane, two plainclothes officers stepped out and stopped them. “We need to see your passports,” one of the officers said. The passengers took them out, and the officers determined who was standing in front of them. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were told to turn around. As they made their way back into the terminal, they were greeted by a phalanx of uniformed and plainclothes officers who arrested them.

What were Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman up to?

At first glance, the two men might seem peripheral to the events that the House is investigating. But they were involved in the Ukraine affair from the beginning, dating to Mr. Parnas’s job as Mr. Giuliani’s fixer in Ukraine.

This evening I stopped by the desk of my colleague Ken Vogel, who revealed Mr. Parnas’s involvement in Mr. Giuliani’s Ukraine efforts, to get a sense of why they matter to the impeachment investigation."

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race’s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware , he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain . Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years.

Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health iss ue .

Still, M r. Sanders’s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator . Indeed, Mr. Sanders’s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign.

“Bernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,” said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. “He’ll be looked at a little differently” for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added.

“I have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack” not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders “surely will think about a running mate.”"

It was unclear to what degree Mr. Giuliani’s memos served as fodder for Mr. Solomon, who independently interviewed Mr. Lutsenko and other sources.

Mr. Solomon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lobbying disclosure law contains an exemption for legal work, and Mr. Giuliani said his efforts to unearth information and push both for investigations in Ukraine and for news coverage of his findings originated with his defense of Mr. Trump in the special counsel’s investigation.

He acknowledged that his work morphed into a more general dragnet for dirt on Mr. Trump’s targets but said that it was difficult to separate those lines of inquiry from his original mission of discrediting the origins of the special counsel’s investigation.

Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Lutsenko never specifically asked him to try to force Ms. Yovanovitch’s recall, saying he concluded himself that Mr. Lutsenko probably wanted her fired because he had complained that she was stifling his investigations.

“He didn’t say to me, ‘I came here to get Yovanovitch fired.’ He came here because he said he had been trying to transmit this information to your government for the past year, and had been unable to do it,” Mr. Giuliani said of his meeting in New York with Mr. Lutsenko. “I transmitted the information to the right people.”

The president sought to distance himself earlier on Friday from Mr. Giuliani, saying he was uncertain when asked whether Mr. Giuliani still represented him. “I haven’t spoken to Rudy,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I spoke to him yesterday quickly. He is a very good attorney and he has been my attorney.”

Mr. Giuliani later said that he still represented Mr. Trump.

The recall of the ambassador and the efforts by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani to push for investigations in Ukraine have emerged as the focus of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump."

There truly is strength in numbers. Just a few Republicans — notably Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, both avowed members of the party’s noninterventionist wing — hailed the president’s decision.

“Foreign policy has always been Trump’s Achilles’ heel with Senate Republicans,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former staff adviser to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican who faulted the president’s Syria decision — but not his comments about China and Ukraine. Mr. Conant said Republicans were also driven by their view that Mr. Trump’s foreign policy missteps were more damaging, requiring a more forceful response than his day-to-day incendiary statements.

“Everyone forgets Trump’s tweets after a couple of days,” Mr. Conant said. “But history will never forget if the U.S. allows our Kurdish allies to be massacred.”

At the same time, foreign policy — unlike, say, impeachment — is lower on the president’s priority list. Differences of opinion are less likely to spur him to lash out as he has in recent days, for example, at Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, after Mr. Romney said that the president’s requests of Ukraine and China to investigate Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were “wrong and appalling.” Mr. Trump responded with name-calling, disparagement and a gleeful reminder of Mr. Obama’s defeat of Mr. Romney in 2012.

Foreign policy appears to be one of the few areas where Mr. Trump is willing to brook some difference of opinion. Pressed on Monday about the tough criticism of his Syria policy from the likes of Mr. Graham; Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Nikki R. Haley, Mr. Trump’s former United Nations ambassador, the president was uncharacteristically restrained.

“I have great respect for all of the people that you named,” Mr. Trump said. “And they have their opinion, and a lot of people do.

Mr. Trump, he said, makes “a wonderful tyrant but he’s a miserable president.”

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis. The two freshmen are a favorite target of conservatives, who have caricatured them as the true leaders of their party."

Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said of Mr. Kent, after departing from the room where he was being deposed.

“And that was wrong,” Mr. Connolly said. “He used that word, ‘wrong.’”

After the May 23 meeting called by Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Kent told investigators, he and others whose portfolios included Ukraine were edged out by Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union; Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine; and Rick Perry, the energy secretary, who “declared themselves the three people now responsible for Ukraine policy,” Mr. Connolly said.

The meeting occurred on the same day that Mr. Sondland, Mr. Volker and Mr. Perry urged Mr. Trump in an Oval Office briefing to support and arrange a White House meeting for the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, from whose inauguration they had just returned. It was unclear if the meeting described by Mr. Kent was the same one or another session.

Mr. Trump replied skeptically, telling the group that Ukrainian politicians are “all corrupt.” In the weeks after that, Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker began working with Mr. Giuliani to urge Mr. Zelensky to commit to the investigations sought by Mr. Trump.

Mr. Kent said he was told at another point to “lay low” on Ukraine matters.

The accounts are trickling out even as the White House seeks to block even more information from surfacing in the impeachment inquiry. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday defied a request by investigators for documents related to the inquiry, and the Defense Department, the Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Giuliani all gave notice that they would defy subpoenas to turn over material. All of them cited the lack of a House vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry as grounds for stonewalling."

Try inviting the world to do everything short of casting a ballot. Not even QAnon could have seen this twist coming.

On Thursday, the president again asked Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, to investigate one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump went on to ask the same of Xi Jinping, preoccupied though the Chinese leader is at the moment with trying to suffocate a democratic uprising in Hong Kong.

Ms. Warren’s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend.

It’s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans.

Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past?

Whither Mayor Pete?

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls.

So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by “West Wing”-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark.

Does anyone else break out of the pack?

Speaking at a campaign rally hours after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered a cease-fire, Mr. Trump defended his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, effectively clearing the way for a brutal Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters who had fought for years alongside the United States against the Islamic State.

The president’s decision to pull out drew rebukes from both Democrats and Republicans, who accused him of abandoning America’s friends. But Mr. Trump said the violence of the past week was useful. “It was unconventional what I did,” he acknowledged. “Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids,” he added. “Then you pull them apart.”

While he has previously denied giving Turkey the green light to attack the Kurds, Mr. Trump implied on Thursday night that actually he had done so in order to persuade the two sides to come to terms. “Without a little tough love, they would never have made this deal,” he said."

It was very revealing.

At mid-concert, the chairman of the Kennedy Center, David M. Rubinstein, came out to greet the audience and the V.I.P.s. He welcomed the different ambassadors, then he went through the cabinet members present and then the Supreme Court justices. He introduced Justice Samuel Alito, who got a smattering of applause. Then he introduced Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seated in the balcony. First many women in the audience stood up to applaud. And then everyone stood up. And then everyone applauded. And then everyone applauded more. And then some people cheered. And then some whistled. And it went on and on and on.

It was extraordinary. I’ve been to a lot of Kennedy Center concerts, and a few when the president, sitting in his official box, was introduced. But I’ve never witnessed anything like the reception for Justice Ginsburg. And this was not a totally liberal audience. There were many older G.O.P. donors and corporate types there. This was a spontaneous, bipartisan expression of respect for, and longing for, a national leader of integrity and humility — after three years of a president utterly without shame, for whom no ethical red line has been too red to cross.

There is still a civic pulse in this country. Some Americans still support President Trump, but far, far more are exhausted and disgusted by him. And that is why his latest outrage is so dangerous to him. He knows that we know that many Republicans know that he committed an impeachable offense. And it’s all out there now: a whistle-blower complaint filed by a C.I.A. officer detailing how Trump dangled military assistance in front of the president of Ukraine if he would do Trump a “favor” and investigate bogus corruption charges against Joe Biden."

She is the author, with Clifford Gaddy, of “Mr. Putin,” a critical biography of the Russian leader, and she was appointed senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs on the National Security Council staff in 2017. She turned over her duties to her successor on July 15 and left on July 19, just days before the July 25 call.

For much of her tenure, Ms. Hill found herself caught in the middle, a noted skeptic of Mr. Putin working for a president who valued his friendship with the Russian leader. She came under fire from some of the most conservative figures and news media outlets around Mr. Trump, which portrayed her as an enemy within, even as some of her longtime friends and colleagues expressed disapproval that she had gone to work for the president in the first place.

One of the most dramatic moments she described came in the July 10 meeting in Mr. Bolton’s office that included Mr. Sondland; Kurt D. Volker, then the special envoy for Ukraine; Rick Perry, the energy secretary; and two Ukrainian officials.

The purpose of the meeting was to talk about technical assistance to Ukraine’s national security council. The Ukrainians were eager to set up a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, who was elected on a promise to clean up corruption and resolve the country’s five-year war with Russian-armed separatists.

Mr. Bolton was trying to not commit to a meeting, according to Ms. Hill’s testimony. Mr. Sondland got agitated, Ms. Hill testified, and let out that there was an agreement with Mr. Mulvaney that there would be a meeting if Ukraine opened up the investigations the White House was seeking.

Mr. Bolton immediately ended the meeting abruptly. As the group moved toward the door, Mr. Sondland said he wanted them to come down to the ward room next to the White House mess to discuss next steps. Mr. Bolton pulled Ms. Hill aside to instruct her to go to the ward room and report to him what they talked about.

When she got downstairs, Mr. Sondland was talking with the Ukrainians and specifically mentioned Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm that had Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, on its board."

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , two associates of Rudy Giuliani , were indicted on campaign finance charges. They were part of the pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate President Trump ’s political rivals, including Joe Biden .

Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York said Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman “conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office,” including by making donations to a pro-Trump super PAC. Read the indictment.

The indictment refers to a “Congressman-1” — identified in campaign finance filings as former Representative Pete Sessions , Republican of Texas — who was the beneficiary of approximately $3 million that the super PAC spent during the 2018 cycle. The men sought Mr. Sessions’s assistance in removing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, “at least in part at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,” according to the indictment. (The men were also seeking political assistance setting up a legal marijuana business in Nevada.)

Shortly after the indictment became public, House impeachment investigators issued subpoenas to Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, compelling them to speak with Congress about their work with Mr. Giuliani in Ukraine.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry was subpoenaed for records that could shed light on any role he may have played in Mr. Trump’s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government. Investigators also want to know whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine’s state-owned gas company.

A dramatic airport arrest

Katie Benner, who covers the Justice Department for us, said federal prosecutors probably had the indictment ready to go for a while and were keeping tabs on Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. When the two got one-way tickets out of the country, she said, the prosecutors realized that they had to move.

My colleague Mike Schmidt got an eyewitness account of the arrests in the Lufthansa lounge in the B concourse of Dulles International Airport on Wednesday. Here’s what he heard:

They were indulging themselves in the free drinks and food while talking on the phone and waiting for their overnight flight to Frankfurt. Around 5:45 p.m., the men and the other first class travelers were invited to board before all the other passengers. As they made their way down a corridor toward their plane, two plainclothes officers stepped out and stopped them. “We need to see your passports,” one of the officers said. The passengers took them out, and the officers determined who was standing in front of them. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were told to turn around. As they made their way back into the terminal, they were greeted by a phalanx of uniformed and plainclothes officers who arrested them.

What were Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman up to?

At first glance, the two men might seem peripheral to the events that the House is investigating. But they were involved in the Ukraine affair from the beginning, dating to Mr. Parnas’s job as Mr. Giuliani’s fixer in Ukraine.

Interviewed on ABC shortly before Mr. Schiff, Mr. Giuliani at first said he “wouldn’t cooperate with Adam Schiff,” then said he “will consider it.”

Sunday night was only the latest effort by Ms. Pelosi to try to strike a dignified tone for the process with her appearance on “60 Minutes.” In a series of interviews, she has been making the case that Mr. Trump engaged in “a cover-up,” calling this moment a “sad day for our country.”

But the carefully coordinated messaging campaign may be upended before it starts. Liberals are reveling in news of an inquiry that they believe should have been opened long ago. The campaign of Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, whose profane cry for impeachment made news on her first day in office, is already selling T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan using a two-letter abbreviation for the expletive she used back in January.

And on the presidential campaign trail, Democrats are talking up impeachment, which poses a danger that the public will think the party is prejudging the outcome of the inquiry and politicizing a solemn task that has grave implications for the future of the nation.

“We need to make sure this is fact-driven and evidence-based, “ said Representative Josh Gottheimer, a centrist Democrat from New Jersey who had resisted calls for the inquiry until now. “You can’t prejudge something that is so solemn and obviously could have a big historical impact on our country, and you need to keep the country together.”

For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada — the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate.

But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden , some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates.

At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals — supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates’ appeal.

These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Julián Castro — candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls.
