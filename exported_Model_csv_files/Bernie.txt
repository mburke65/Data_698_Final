We began to see it a couple of weeks ago, when staffers and supporters of other Democratic candidates began criticizing her, arguing either that the only true progressive champion in the race is Sanders or that her ambitious plans are too pie-in-the-sky to pass Congress.Early on, campaign staff and advisers argued that her main problem was name identification, since fewer people knew her than Biden, Sanders or Warren.While Biden, Warren and Sanders have long-established political identities — Biden pitching himself as a return to normalcy, Warren advocating “structural change” and Sanders pushing a revolution — Harris entered the campaign without an easy-to-sum-up pitch, and has yet to establish one.Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are in competition for many white, working-class voters, although Biden also has a strong base of African American support, polls show.In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s strong showing in the South helped propel her to victory over Sanders.… ‘I think it’s puzzling …Why you wouldn't just say so and then explain why you think that's the better way forward?’ Buttigieg asked, noting that [Bernie Sanders] has said his plan to provide ‘Medicare for All’ would raise taxes across the board.From Time: “Maurice Mitchell, the National Director of the Working Families Party (WFP) and an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, received messages calling him a ‘half man’ and ‘Uncle Tom,’ and telling him to ‘go back to his slave masters' … The endorsement, one of the first from a progressive group, was seen a triumph for Warren and a setback for Sanders, who has praised the Working Families Party as an example of ‘my vision of Democratic socialism.’ In the days since, WFP staffers were inundated with messages calling them ‘liberal sellouts,’ ‘corporate frauds,’ and ‘just as corrupt as the DNC,’ often accompanied with the hashtag #BernieorBust.”

-- The Sanders campaign said it has now received contributions from over 1 million individual donors.By the end of Saturday, Warren had taken some flack from the left, for telling the People’s Action forum in Des Moines (limited to a few left-wing candidates) that she did not support a national rent control policy; Sanders does.Bernie Sanders is struggling.In June, when the “Selzer poll” found the senator from Vermont's support at just 16 percent, the Sanders campaign insisted that the pollster was not capturing the strength of its game plan.Since then, the Sanders campaign has parted with its Iowa political director and deputy director, admitting what it won’t say: The plan wasn’t working.Sanders is now less popular with Democrats than he was four years ago.Sanders has declined without making any traditional mistakes.When asked in the Selzer poll how they defined “electability,” a supermajority of Iowa Democrats — 74 percent — said it was “exciting new voters to show up.” That's exactly what Sanders has been arguing for years that he can do.At the steak fry, like at every “cattle call,” Sanders eschewed big shows of enthusiasm to emphasize organizing.But it hasn't solved Sanders's central problem: He has reactivated his donor base but hasn't reunited his electoral coalition.Outside the Warren-Biden-Sanders triad at the top of the polls, just Booker and three other Democrats have double-digit favorables: Harris’s net rating is 39 percent, Klobuchar’s is 30 percent, O’Rourke’s is 28 percent.For now, the poll positions Warren as the candidate with the most first-choice and second-choice support, stitching together a coalition of liberals who backed Sanders in 2016 and Hillary Clinton supporters; Sanders gets no support from Clinton 2016 voters.While Biden outperforms other Democrats in trial heats, and while his coalition does not entirely overlap with Warren's, he has about the same level of support and opposition; Sanders, who for a long time was the most broadly popular candidate, has the lowest ceiling of support.In June and July, de Blasio emerged as a pugilist on Sanders’s and Warren’s behalf, raising his hand when asked whether he would eliminate private insurance, then aggressively defending the idea.Bernie Sanders.AD

HEALTH ON THE HILL

— Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled a plan to erase Americas’ medical debt, about $81 billion, the latest in his ambitious set of promises to overhaul the nation’s health-care system.“The proposals reflect Mr. Sanders’s concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care — but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy.”

Sanders spoke about medical debt at a recent campaign event, via Politico's Dan Diamond:

— A new poll from the Wall Street Journal and NBC finds about two-thirds of registered voters support expanding Medicare by letting people buy into the program, but 56 percent say they are against a Medicare-for-all plan that would mean getting rid of private insurance.— And here are a few more good reads:

Politics Bernie Sanders has a problem.AD

After all, the Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calls for eliminating premiums, deductibles and co-pays.), rising fast in the polls, has embraced Sanders’s plan but studiously avoids answering any questions about a possible tax increase.But for the sake of argument, let’s look at the numbers Biden and Sanders are using.Sanders has offered a menu of possible options to finance the cost of Medicare-for-all.AD

AD

But Sanders argues that those taxes would be cheaper than the current system.Sanders offers as an example a prototypical family of four earning $50,000.Sanders’s 7.5 percent tax would be $3,750, so that suggests more than $9,000 in savings for the employer.As for the 4 percent income premium paid by the employee, that amounts to $844 a year, once the standard deduction is taken into account, Sanders says.AD

AD

Notice that he did not take into account any of the savings that Sanders claims his plan will generate both for the employee and employer.Sanders also chose an example in which the numbers work in his favor.Sanders also focuses on the cost of a family plan, which has much higher premiums.The report does not examine all of the same financing options as Sanders, but it calculated that a three-person family with $60,000 income would gain almost $1,600 (2.6 percent) in additional income under Medicare-for-all, while a family with income of $221,000 (top 20 percent of wages earners), would lose $8,520 (3.9 percent) and a family with $401,000 (top 5 percent) would lose $22,340 (5.6 percent).AD

Biden may have bungled his lines at the town hall, but he still has not developed an effective or sophisticated counterargument to Sanders’s prediction of lower overall costs.“We appear to have a president who, unbelievably, may have used security funds — funds designed to protect the security of the people of the United States — as a means to gain political dirt on an opponent,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Tuesday at a campaign stop in Davenport, Iowa, calling for the House to begin impeachment proceedings now.AD

DECORAH, Iowa — The crowd that came to see Bernie Sanders was too big for Luther College's gym.It spilled over into a yard, where the senator delivered a short version of his stump speech — “the fate of the planet is at stake, democracy is at stake” — before he walked into a room full of “Bernie Beats Trump” signs.“I'm not necessarily a Bernie fan,” said Justin Knautz, 20, who said he was leaning toward South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigeg.“Even if he could beat Trump, which I'm not sure about, our country's so divided already.”

“I'm super confident that he'd win,” Avery Pazour, 20, said of Sanders.Five months after Sanders began arguing that he was the most electable Democratic candidate, a pitch he made with a tour of Rust Belt states, he has made little progress with voters terrified of a second Trump term.roughly tied with Sanders on “electability.”

The “Bernie beats Trump” tour was the latest attempt to push back.In Iowa, Sanders occasionally referred to the national and state polls that have shown him ahead of Trump, but in an interview, he waved off the polling that had shown Democratic voters still nervous about how a democratic socialist could take the presidency.“I'm not much into all these speculations and all these polls,” Sanders said.But at the end of the day, I think we're going to win, because we have an extraordinary grass-roots movement.”

Apart from some turnover in its early state staff, the Sanders campaign has shown some broad support.But it has struggled to convince early-state voters that Sanders could win a general election, and the senator's support in early states has slipped since the start of his campaign.In interviews around the state, some at the senator from Vermont's rallies, voters sometimes praised Sanders or explained why they used to support him before laying out the reasons that they were supporting someone else.We need somebody more realistic.”

Sanders's campaign is combating the skepticism with a busy schedule and with sharp contrasts, some of them brighter than others.Speech by speech, Sanders has structured an electability pitch around his brand — that of an Old Testament prophet who has been saying the same things about health care and economic fairness for 30 years.“Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes!How terrible is this guy?” Sanders said sarcastically in Decorah, waving his arms and imitating a negative ad.That theory is getting a real-time test in Iowa, one that has not gone well for Sanders.(Sanders has not yet purchased TV time in early states.)“There's a lot of lies going on about this,” Sanders said in Dubuque.After learning that a pollster at Anzalone Liszt Grove Research had been testing messages against Medicare-for-all — John Anzalone is an adviser to Biden — Sanders emphasized that he was collecting story after story of medical debt, denied coverage and personal pain.At every event, Sanders sees a story that is not being told in the corporate media.But we're going to win this fight because we're going to refute that disingenuous attack,” Sanders said.Well, I don't know that Americans have to be chumps and to give the health-care industry $100 billion a year.”

Polling has found Democrats to be nervous about that argument, even if they agree with Sanders on the merits.In the Des Moines Register's weekend poll, a quarter of Democrats said they supported the concept of Medicare-for-all but were worried it was a general election loser — a threat to the entire Sanders premise.At a Democratic meeting in Story County on Sunday, Linda Trudeau, 72, said that had never been convinced that Sanders could win.“She's not quite nailed down on that, unlike Bernie.That's a good thing.”

AD

The plan to tax the wealthy could pay for some of Sanders’s plans but fall short of covering other parts of his agenda.Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman at the University of California at Berkeley estimate Sanders’s plan would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, although conservatives have said such estimates overstate how much can be raised through a wealth tax.Sanders has unveiled a $2.5 trillion plan to end homelessness and create 10 million new housing units and a $1.7 trillion plan to cancel all student debt in the United States; those two initiatives alone would come close to equaling the money raised by the wealth tax.The senator has proposed a $30 trillion Medicare-for-all health-care system that would eliminate families’ health-care spending, which Sanders has said would be paid for with higher middle-class taxes, as well as ­taxes on the wealthy.Zucman noted on Twitter that Sanders’s plan “would make it much harder to remain a multibillionaire durably.” But he said that if Sanders’s tax had been enacted in the 1980s, billionaires’ share of the national wealth would still have increased.That means Sanders’s plan would stop short of a “maximum income” plan favored by some on the left, although Sanders has come out in favor of that as a long-term goal, telling the New York Times, “I don’t think that billionaires should exist.”

That position follows months of debates in left-leaning circles over whether Democrats should push taxes high enough to eliminate all billion-dollar fortunes, an idea championed, for example, by an aide to first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment were before the Senate, explaining that he wanted to review evidence before concluding how he would vote,” our colleagues write.At an appearance in California, Julián Castro directly compared what Trump was doing to the endless negativity of 2016: “Donald Trump is trying to do to Joe Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton; to turn somebody who has given a lifetime of service, and done it honorably, into the victim of false accusations.” Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of the Bernie Sanders campaign, said no candidate should amplify what the president was saying about Biden.Pressed on whether the controversy over Hunter Biden and Ukraine made Biden a weaker candidate, Sanders demurred: “You make the judgment.Sanders narrowly leads with Latinos, with 28 percent support to 26 percent for Biden and 14 for Warren; Biden leads with black voters, with 32 percent to Warren's 24 percent, Harris's 18 percent and Sanders's 11 percent.Among white voters without college degrees and voters making less than $50,000, the percentage of “excited” voters is, respectively, 69 percent and 67 percent; for Sanders, it's 52 percent and 62 percent.2020

Sanders aides revealed Wednesday that he had experienced chest pains at a campaign event Tuesday and had undergone a stent procedure to clear an artery blockage.After he left the hospital Friday, his campaign released a statement from his doctors saying Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction — a heart attack.AD

But Sanders’s campaign declined to offer much detail about how serious his heart attack was.Asked Friday why they waited to announce the diagnosis, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, “We just wanted to wait until he was discharged to give out the information all at once.”

A heart attack occurs when a portion of the heart muscle is permanently damaged from a lack of blood flow, said Quinn Capers IV, an interventional cardiologist and professor of internal medicine at Ohio State University.In an interview Saturday, Capers said, “The most important thing that dictates how well somebody will do after a heart attack is how much of the heart muscle was permanently damaged.”

Capers said the length of Sanders’s hospital stay suggests a small or moderate heart attack, after which patients can live long and healthy lives — though he cautioned that he could not know for sure because he did not treat the candidate.AD

Sanders hasn’t faced the same scrutiny, in part because he’s struggling to gain momentum in the Democratic primary contest.Sanders doesn’t have a “strong path to the nomination,” said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster.The Sanders campaign has sought to project a business-as-usual attitude as the senator takes time away from his hectic schedule.AD

Campaign aides have said unequivocally that Sanders will attend the Oct. 15 debate, but his campaign schedule shows no other events before then.AD

Capers said that if Sanders were his patient, he would probably recommend seven to eight hours of sleep a night, healthy meals and time for stress release.Sanders raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of the year, an impressive sum that topped all his Democratic rivals.AD

It was unclear how news of Sanders’s heart attack would affect his fundraising and his future campaign strategy.Before his heart attack, Sanders campaigned more aggressively than most, if not all, of his rivals.A handful of Sanders’s Democratic rivals sidestepped questions about Sanders’s health on Saturday.“And obviously, Sanders has had a very unfortunate incident that has pulled him off the trail.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), unabashed in his democratic socialist agenda, has the support of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), three of the most liberal new members of Congress.Can a slipping Sanders rebound?Sanders is second at 21 percent, and Biden, the front-runner since his entrance into the race, is at 18 percent.Among Democrats who call themselves simply “liberal,” she is polling at 33 percent, 12 points ahead of Sanders and 17 points better than Biden.Long mired in single digits, Warren is at 13 percent among black voters (and Sanders at 12) in the GW Politics Poll, though she still trails Biden at 35 percent by a significant margin.That includes 45 percent of Biden voters and 31 percent of Sanders voters.Sanders is the second choice of just 21 percent, and Biden is the second choice of 17 percent.Seventy-two percent of Democrats say they have a favorable impression of her, trailing Sanders (79 percent) and slightly better than Biden (69 percent).Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) could ask Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) why a store manager with no college degree should be paying taxes to subsidize wealthy kids’ college education.Her idea was ambitious and controversial, but Sanders’s idea goes much, much farther.Sanders’s plan not only kicks in earlier, it includes more gradations that tax the mega-rich much more heavily.According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, Sanders’s tax would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, significantly more than Warren’s version.For Sanders, the goal isn’t just to get the overclass to pay their fair share; he wants to cut them down to size.I like the simplicity of Warren’s approach relative to Bernie’s, but given that any such tax is and will be a tremendous political reach from where we stand today, the important thing is to get these ideas bouncing around the echo chamber.Sanders would probably argue that fundamental change starts with getting people to consider ideas that some find radical.But this proposal is one more signal from Sanders that he’s going to go farther in what he proposes than any other Democrat.THE PROGNOSIS

The proposal from Senator Sanders to eliminate medical debt illustrates that health policy is as much about financial security as it is about access to care.That’s good news for Sanders’s ambitious plan."If Bernie Sanders came to us and said 'I need you guys to abolish $81 billion in debt,' he couldn't direct it to that particular group," Antico said.Sanders didn’t go into detail about how he would approach these questions in a web page detailing his proposal.He also consistently overstates the number of people who go bankrupt every year because they can’t pay their medical bills (my Washington Post colleague Salvador Rizzo awarded Sanders three “Pinocchios” for this claim).(Aaron P.

— Sanders calls for 8% wealth tax: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) "unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that could greatly diminish their fortunes,” the New York Times’s Thomas Kaplan reports.Sanders’s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires.His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan.”

Sanders had raised $46.3 million by the end of the second quarter, according to Federal Election Commission records.AD

When not counting transfers, 77 percent of Sanders’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less.AD

Sanders doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from corporate PACs or super PACs, or from fossil fuel, drug or insurance companies.As noted, Sanders and Warren each have transferred nearly $10 million from previous campaigns to their 2020 presidential committees.AD

In Sanders’s case, FEC records show he had transferred $4.6 million from his 2016 to 2020 presidential campaign committee as of the end of the second quarter.In his previous presidential campaign, Sanders had somewhat looser fundraising restrictions in place.Time magazine reported in December 2015: “Sanders has hosted at least nine medium- to high-dollar, closed-door fundraisers in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere to directly fund his own presidential campaign.Even though Sanders’ efforts sometimes have a proletarian flair — he held one $200-per-ticket fundraiser at a dive bar near a grungy Seattle park — some aspects of the Democratic insurgent’s fundraising are similar to the candidates he condemns.”

The debate comes at a tough time for Sanders, who was hospitalized for a heart attack and paused campaigning, right after he shared that he raised the most money of all candidates these past three months.Sanders is 78 and the oldest candidate running for president.It’s fair to say his age and health are the last things Sanders will want to talk about on the debate stage — but that’s reality when you’re running for president and every aspect of your life is under scrutiny.His campaign to date is mostly self-funded, and he entered the race late, after Biden, Warren and Sanders were already dominating the polls.Bernie Sanders is having a heart attack on the campaign trail.What's going to happen if he's elected and dealing with a national security crisis?”

As the debate approached the two-hour mark, Sanders faced a question about his health.When Booker pointed out Sanders favors legalizing marijuana, Sanders quipped, “I'm not on it tonight."Then Sanders, who suffered a heart attack two weeks ago, gave a more serious answer, telling Americans he would prove to them that he has the fitness to serve by “mounting a vigorous campaign,” including a comeback rally with a special guest in New York on Saturday.Sanders isn’t toning it down

Sanders gave a fiery answer, a signal that he is not toning down his combative tendencies in the wake of his health scare.Billionaires’ place in America is discussed

At one point, Sanders was asked whether his goal was to “tax billionaires out of existence.” The Vermont senator launched into a lengthy speech about income inequality in the United States, lamenting the staggering number of homeless, uninsured, underinsured and debt-burdened Americans.That is a moral and economic outrage,” Sanders said.“And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality, and we cannot afford a billionaire class.”

Steyer, the only billionaire on the debate stage, agreed that Sanders was right to go after the wealthy.“As Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income, it’s absolutely wrong, it's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.”

Steyer then advocated for a wealth tax, ending Trump’s tax cuts and increasing the minimum wage.Sanders cut in, noting that he was the person “who wrote the damn bill.”

If the proposal is passed, taxes are going to go up significantly — for the wealthiest Americans, Sanders said.Biden suggested Warren and Sanders needed to be clearer about the high costs of their plan, and he sought to steal some of Buttigieg’s thunder by saying that the mayor’s approach is effectively one he has spearheaded — expanding Obamacare.Sanders snapped back, arguing that those who are defending the current system are advocating for a problematic approach in which many Americans are suffering.“That’s illegal conduct; that’s what he was doing.”

Sanders goes after Trump and Republicans

Sanders, who has been off the campaign trail for two weeks after suffering a heart attack, also went after Trump and Senate Republicans.“Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,” said Sanders, speaking about the topic of impeachment.While his voice was a bit scratchy as he spoke, Sanders sounded much clearer than he did in the last debate, when he was noticeably hoarse.Warren’s response: “Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.”

Sanders, too, defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that McConnell “has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.”

Biden — who only recently came out in favor of impeachment — called Trump the most corrupt president in history.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): The big news, of course, is his recent heart attack.AD

But it’s notable that Sanders is raising all that money at a time when he’s been struggling to win over new converts, and that struggle has led to a lot of negative media stories with headlines like “Bernie Sanders Is in Trouble.”

Or look at Pete Buttigieg.The top fundraisers of the quarter were Sanders ($25.3 million); Warren ($24.7 million); Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.AD

Sanders had $33.7 million cash on hand at the end of the quarter, filings show.Sanders spent nearly $7 million on payroll and associated costs and $3.8 million on fundraising and digital ads, among other major expenses.Six other Democratic candidates have released their third-quarter totals so far: Sanders; Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California ($11.6 million); businessman Andrew Yang ($10 million); Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey ($6 million); and Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado ($2.1 million).In this poll, “Elizabeth Warren had the support of 27 percent [of adults surveyed], with Joe Biden backed by 26 percent and Bernie Sanders a distant third at 10 percent.She has not had to go after Sanders to establish herself as the stand-out candidate for progressives.Even before Sanders’s heart attack, she was establishing herself as more engaging, prepared and accessible candidate, one with a clear message she articulates well.AD

The third question is whether Sanders, who was already slipping in the polls, falls even further to the point where he is a non-factor or leaves the race entirely?Sanders’ heart attack — and his campaign’s less than immediately candid explanation of his health situation — will undoubtedly and appropriately raise questions about health, age and endurance.Ryan Cooper wrote in September, “The top second choice for Sanders supporters is actually Biden (26 percent versus 24 percent for Warren).Voters often have weird preferences like that.” Sanders’s question is: Can he can regain his second-place standing and, if not, where do his voters go?“Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare-for-all, where private insurance is abolished,” the ad says.and Sanders (I-Vt.), but also with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) and others.Compare Warren with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Buttigieg, by the way, ended up having a quarter somewhat like Sanders’s.AD

On Tuesday night, Bernie Sanders supporters jumped onto a call with campaign manager Faiz Shakir.“They were writing the obituaries, and, sadly for them, it has not turned out like that.”

At that moment, Sanders had been addressing around 250 voters in Las Vegas, when he asked for a chair, telling the crowd it had been a “long day.” The next morning, the Sanders campaign announced that the senator had gotten medical attention after the event; “he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted.”

There is not much precedent for what has happened to the Sanders campaign — it is organizing faster than before in early primary states, but its candidate is off the trail, and an Iowa ad buy has been postponed.(Elizabeth Warren's campaign even sent the Sanders team dinner.)On Thursday, the Sanders campaign announced that the senator would recover in time for the Oct. 15 debate outside Columbus, Ohio.His wife, Jane Sanders, said that he was “up and about” and would soon head home to Burlington, Vt., from Las Vegas.“Yesterday, he spent much of the day talking with staff about policies, cracking jokes with the nurses and doctors, and speaking with his family on the phone,” Jane Sanders wrote in a statement.“His doctors are pleased with his progress, and there has been no need for any additional procedures.”

Apart from the canceled ad buy, and a few events, nothing has changed in the Sanders campaign's strategy this week.“If you ask people around the country, what's one thing you know about Bernie Sanders, they're often going to tell you Medicare-for-all or taking on the elite special interests in this country,” Shakir said.The conversation about “which candidate can beat Donald Trump” was limited to Biden and Sanders.When Sanders returns to the trail, he'll jump right back into an argument about electability, with a new issue — a brief health scare — that has historically caused Democrats to panic.Here, Warren leads Biden among white voters by a 29 to 22 margin; Biden leads the field with black voters, who give him 46 percent of their support to 10 percent for Harris, 9 percent for Warren and 8 percent for Sanders.Its new numbers add to the teetering pile of bad news for Harris; it's also good for Sanders, who maintains his leads with young voters and Latino voters in the big primary state where he spent the most time.(Sanders's Hail Mary play at the end of the 2016 primary was to win California and move “superdelegates” away from Hillary Clinton.But the poll was conducted before the Ukraine saga began and long before Sanders's health scare, two story lines that have yet to be reflected in polls.for being “vague” on taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all and zinging Sanders for supporting a hugely expensive health-care plan.She actually got to Sanders’s left on foreign policy, obliterating a contrast with Trump that other candidates can exploit.Sanders had a single job: Show he was the picture of health with the stamina to wage a vigorous campaign and then govern.Sanders even managed to get in a sound argument on foreign policy opposing Trump for cutting and running in Syria, making the United States an unreliable ally.Swing batter, batter: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg both aggressively called out Warren for giving an evasive answer on whether Medicare-for-all will raise taxes on the middle class, which Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had done just moments before.“At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” Klobuchar said.They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy," Sanders said.In comparison:

By June, that meant that just three 2020 Democrats supported Sanders’s proposal as written: Sanders himself, Elizabeth Warren and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.“It’s a false choice, because it preserves the multi-payer system that’s responsible for administrative waste,” said Lighty, who supports Sanders.If you do a ‘glide path’ you’ve still got that problem and you’ve got premiums people may or may not be able to afford.”

In the last few weeks, the private insurance debate has actually given way to a more confusing one: whether Medicare-for-all would raise “middle-class taxes.” The program’s advocates, like Sanders, point out that even conservative cost estimates find that a single-payer system costs less than a mixed private-public system.2020

During the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) highlighted the issue in their quest to win younger black voters.Sanders has been steady in the debates but rarely the standout, and he continues to be a powerhouse grass-roots fundraiser.The Ohio debate was Sanders’s first major event since he suffered a heart attack, prompting questions about his health and age, though Tuesday night, he was robust and vigorous on the stage.Busting in at one point, Sanders said, “I’m healthy, I’m feeling great.”

The first votes are still months away, but already the campaign has run through several cycles of conventional wisdom.“Anyone who thinks they’re going to walk away with this nomination purely on the debate stage” is wrong, said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’s campaign manager.Warren’s response: “Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that McConnell “has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.”

As first reported by the Post’s Sean Sullivan and some other guy, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) will appear at Sen. Bernie Sanders’s Saturday rally in Queens to endorse him for president.Also supporting Sanders: Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.The Sanders campaign, meanwhile, argued that the “squad” endorsements would help their candidate build a “multi-racial coalition” and win the primary and the general election.“As you've heard Bernie Sanders say a million times, in order for him to win, we have to mobilize young people,” said Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir.“If we can have a turnout of young people that doubles, you'd have the revolution that Bernie Sanders has been eager to see come about.”

The endorsements come as Sanders has slipped with that coalition.In its early days, the 2020 Sanders campaign pointed to polls to argue that their candidate had the youngest, most diverse and most working-class support of anyone seeking the Democratic nomination.That’s changed as Sanders has fallen back — though, to be fair, he runs stronger in some polls than others.By this month, Sanders was at 5 percent with black voters (the pollsters had changed its nonwhite sampling) and 18 percent with voters making under $50,000; Warren was at 18 and 19 percent with those groups.The Sanders campaign is bullish.About one in three Americans strongly favor each of these proposals.”

Right now, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) leads the Democratic field in net favorability among Democrats and Democratic leaners with 55 percent.“I do think it’s appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up,” Sanders said.“At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” Klobuchar said.That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.”

AHH: Pete Buttigieg sharpened his aim at rivals Warren and Sanders with a new ad released ahead of last night's debate.“Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare-for-all, where private insurance is abolished,” one commentator says.On health care, Buttigieg accuses Warren and Sanders of not trusting the American people to choose the right health care plans for themselves.The Health 202 wrote last month that Buttigieg’s “Medicare-for-all-who-want-it” plan appears to be a riff off the Sanders plan, but actually builds on the Affordable Care Act and looks more like a public option, comparable to the public option plan laid out by Biden.Sen.

Bernie Sanders.His surrogates tackled different themes, from alleged ageism in coverage of Sanders to how he'd pulled them, personally, into politics.“I want you all to take a look around and find someone you don't know,” said Sanders, a tack he has not taken in stump speeches.He held two New York fundraisers while Sanders rallied nearby, taking a swipe at the president's attempt to hold the G-7 meeting in “his failing country club so he can make money.” A few hours later, President Trump abandoned that plan.AD

Warren, whose stock has risen more than any other candidate this year, growing steadily as Biden, Sanders and Harris have faltered, also faces a renewed challenge from the left.Her main competition on that front, Sanders, has revived his campaign since suffering a heart attack three weeks ago, posting impressive fundraising numbers and hosting the biggest rally of the election cycle, featuring an endorsement from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).And it suggests we’ll be learning more soon enough — perhaps confirming that Sanders got the bigger story exactly right.In the video, a man dressed in a suit, with Trump’s head superimposed on the body, embarks on a bloody rampage in a church, targeting occupants labeled with the logos of media organizations, including The Washington Post; lawmakers including Rep.

Foreign policy Sanders faced criticism during his last presidential bid for his lack of experience with foreign policy, but he has since developed expertise and messaging around issues abroad.In 2018, Sanders led bipartisan efforts to end U.S. support for the Saudi regime — culminating in a resolution that passed the House and the Senate but was vetoed by President Trump.Sanders has celebrated diplomacy and foreign aid and spoke about the United States’ responsibility to support humanity worldwide.See all candidates

Government A believer in structural reform, Sanders has called to abolish the electoral college and has said he wants to overhaul the Senate filibuster.Sanders has sponsored legislation on voter reforms such as automatic registration and making Election Day a national holiday.Instead of adding justices to the Supreme Court, as some 2020 presidential candidates have proposed, Sanders has suggested “rotating judges to the appeals court” to allow for “new blood” in the highest chamber.See all candidates

Health care Sanders is known for his commitment to Medicare-for-all, a single-payer health-care plan that has gained traction with other liberal Democrats.Sanders tried to combat these concerns in October, releasing a proposal that would introduce a new wealth tax on those earning $32 million or more.The medical problem Sanders experienced — though it can be serious if untreated — is a common affliction in men his age.Although, if Bernie were my patient, I might tell him not to work 16 hours a day for a little while, just to make sure recovery goes well.”

Coronary arteries — arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle — can become blocked over time with the buildup of fatty deposits or plaque.So when a patient like Sanders comes in complaining of chest pains, doctors usually perform an angiogram to diagnose the problem, said Elizabeth Klodas, a cardiologist in Minneapolis.AD

AD

The fact that doctors placed two stents in Sanders could mean he had two blockages on the same artery, or that it was an especially long blockage that required two stents to open up, Klodas said.“And the outlook is often very good.”

At 78, Sanders is the oldest among the candidates running for the Democratic nomination.Sanders’s doctor released a letter during the 2016 campaign showing he had a history of elevated cholesterol but no indication of heart disease at the time.In some ways, Sanders was fortunate, experts note, because half the men who suddenly die of heart disease have no previous symptoms, such as the chest pains Sanders felt.AD

Sanders often jokes about his age at town halls and when meeting with voters.And Sanders’s heart problem may revive the topic of age among Democratic Party voters, who must choose in coming months whether to nominate a candidate from among the three candidates over the age of 70 or from the new younger generation of leaders also running.AD

The statement, released after Sanders left the hospital, marked the first time the campaign had acknowledged he had a heart attack.AD

Asked Friday why they waited to announce the diagnosis, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, “We just wanted to wait until he was discharged to give out the information all at once.”

On Wednesday, Sanders’s campaign said he was hospitalized after experiencing chest pains at a Tuesday night campaign event.He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.”

It was not immediately clear what effect Sanders’s health issues would have on his second straight campaign for the presidency.While he was hospitalized, a senior aide said his campaign events were canceled “until further notice.”

Sanders planned to fly home to Vermont on Saturday, his campaign said.Shortly after leaving the hospital, Sanders posted a video on Twitter in which he said he was feeling better.AD

His wife, Jane, said before his release that Sanders would “take a few days to rest” but would take part in the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate.An arterial blockage such as Sanders’s typically has a good prognosis and does not normally require a long recovery period, medical experts said earlier this week, before it was known that he had suffered a heart attack.AD

Sanders’s condition has revived a debate over age and health in the Democratic Party.Sanders’s medical crisis occurred amid some good news for his campaign — an announcement this week that he raised $25.3 million, more than any other candidate for the Democratic nomination, in the third quarter.AD

Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir sought to emphasize his position in the money chase on Friday.“Our third quarter fundraising totals make clear that Bernie’s campaign is part of a working class movement taking on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite,” Shakir said in a statement.We’re going to win and create the political revolution.”

Sanders, in a tweet issued from the hospital this week, used his hospitalization to argue for his agenda, specifically the Medicare-for-all plan he has long championed.In the statement released by his campaign Friday, Sanders thanked the doctors and nurses who treated him.“After two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work,” Sanders said.The plan, which would probably face substantial pushback from Republicans and corporations, is the latest flag planted by Sanders (I-Vt.) at the leftmost boundary of the Democratic field.has been siphoning support from Sanders among the party’s most liberal voters, a group that belonged solely to Sanders in 2016.But Warren’s support has been climbing while Sanders’s has been fading, and polls suggest that while the senator from Vermont is cementing support from his core followers with his purist plans, Warren may be benefiting from the perception that she is not the most radical figure in the Democratic field.But in an interview Sunday at his home in Burlington, Vt., Sanders was pressed by ABC’s Jon Karl to draw a line between him and Warren, and he did so, albeit with apparent reluctance.I’m not,” Sanders said.Enough with your greed and your corruption.’ ”

Monday’s plan is the second proposal Sanders has issued since being sidelined from the trail that seeks to cut corporate influence.AD

Beyond that, Sanders would require the companies to issue a portion of their stock holdings to a fund controlled by workers.These worker-controlled shares — Sanders calls them “Democratic Employee Ownership Funds” — would give employees a percentage of the dividends paid out by the corporation.Sanders takes a step beyond Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, by calling for corporations to turn over at least 20 percent of their shares to these worker funds, compared to 10 percent for Corbyn.Sanders’s plan would aim to give an additional 56 million workers, in more than 22,000 companies, a share of their businesses.“What we want is democracy within the workplace, so the decisions aren’t all being made by a tiny number of people,” said Peter Gowan, a senior policy associate at the Democracy Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank, who worked with the Sanders campaign on the proposal.AD

Sanders also proposes some smaller measures designed to increase worker control of the economy, such as a $500 million bank for employees who want to buy or start their own firms and the creation of “worker ownership centers” to help employees manage their own companies.Sanders also offered a sweeping set of antitrust policies, including a new “bright line” that would bar mergers of companies with too much market share.Sanders also proposes some smaller measures designed to increase worker control of the economy, such as a $500 million bank for employees who want to buy or start their own firms and the creation of “worker ownership centers” to help employees manage their own companies.AD

Sanders also offered a sweeping set of antitrust policies, including a new “bright line” that would bar mergers of companies that dominate too much market share.A Sanders campaign aide has said the senator has introduced legislation to prevent misclassification of workers as contractors.Sanders’s plan would also repeal the 2017 GOP tax cut for corporations, which lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.Many congressional Democrats also favor raising the corporate tax rate, though few want to raise it as much as Sanders.Corporate tax rates have fallen globally, including in the European countries often cited as a model by Sanders, with Sweden and Norway both taxing firms below 25 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Sanders’s supporters say his approach would provide much-needed influence to ordinary Americans, but conservatives argue that raising corporate taxes would ultimately hurt those same people.“During this campaign, I’ve been doing in some cases three or four rallies a day, running all over the state — Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever,” Sanders told reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vt. “And yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been.And I should have listened to those symptoms.”

Sanders visited a cardiologist Tuesday morning, and when he returned, he told reporters, “We’re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit.”

“Probably not doing four rallies a day,” said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents.— fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records.Sanders met reporters outside his Burlington home where he has spent the past few days with family, making calls and recovering from a heart attack he suffered during a grass roots fundraising event in Las Vegas last week.AD

The campaign had not initially disclosed that Sanders had suffered a heart attack, acknowledging at first only that the stents had been implanted.Tuesday’s remarks were the first in which Sanders himself has been so open about what happened.AD

Far from admitting he was tired, Sanders tried to demonstrate that despite his age he remained robust and vibrant.Sanders cut his head on a shower door in March, and had to cancel a day of events when he lost his voice in September.AD

“If there’s any message that I hope we can get out there, it’s that I want people to pay attention to their symptoms,” Sanders said.“When you’re hurting, when you’re fatigued, when you have a pain in your chest — listen to it.”

Some Sanders advisers and supporters said they hoped Sanders would slow his campaigning pace somewhat, a wish that seems likely to be granted for at least the next few days.Campaign officials have signaled that Sanders will not hit the campaign trail again until next Tuesday’s debate.AD

Allies also say they hope Sanders will talk openly about his heart attack as a way to present a more human side, a departure for a candidate noticeably reluctant to talk about himself.On Monday, Sanders’s team rolled out a proposal to curtail the role of money in politics.Later Tuesday, the Sanders team announced a series of endorsements from local officials in Nevada.And Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair, tweeted that Sanders “had a great call” with his campaign co-chairs.Sanders’s hiatus from the trail mean the Democratic debate in Ohio next week is likely to be a crucial moment for his campaign.She said Sanders would “take a few days to rest, but he’s ready to get back out there and is looking forward to the October debate.”

The next debate will be held on Oct. 15 near Columbus, Ohio.It remained unclear whether Sanders, 78, would resume his normal campaign activities before the debate.Jeff Weaver, a senior Sanders adviser, said Wednesday that Sanders had canceled appearances “until further notice.”

The overall state of Sanders’s health was also unclear.A spokesman declined to provide more specifics about his condition beyond the statement from Jane Sanders.A TV ad campaign in Iowa the Sanders team had abruptly put off will begin on Tuesday, a campaign spokesman said.AD

Sanders was hospitalized during a trip to Nevada after experiencing chest pains at a Tuesday campaign event, according to Weaver.Jane Sanders flew to Las Vegas to be with him on Wednesday, according to the campaign.An artery blockage such as Sanders’s normally has a good prognosis and does not tend to require a long recovery period, medical experts said.Sanders has been campaigning at an aggressive pace in recent weeks, often holding multiple events per day, sometimes in more than one state.AD

Sanders generally appears robust and energetic, but he has dealt with minor health issues over the past few months, such as losing his voice during a trip to Denver and injuring his head on the edge of a shower door in March, opening a wound that required seven stitches.AD

Sanders has vowed to release his health records before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the primary season.Sanders received encouragement and well wishes from near and far as he recovered in Las Vegas.Harry M.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) promised a speedy return to the campaign trail after leaving the hospital Friday, but it was unclear whether the 78-year-old would be able to replicate his previously frenetic travel schedule.Some fear that Sanders’s health problems put a spotlight on the advanced age of the top contenders, all of whom are in their 70s.All I know is our side better learn to fight better.”

Democratic leaders and strategists also expressed concern that Sanders’s recent illness could raise fresh questions about the septuagenarian polling leaders.Sanders started the week on a high note, announcing a significant third-quarter fundraising haul of $25.3 million, larger than every other Democratic candidate.“Now, because of Senator Sanders, maybe the issue will come up more.”

The three top-polling candidates have promised to release medical records before the Iowa caucuses, but the Sanders campaign was not fully transparent about his condition.Both Harris’s and Sanders’s campaign staff have pointed out that Warren, who boasts regularly of her grass-roots fundraising model, transferred $10 million into her campaign, including money she had solicited from wealthy donors during her Senate efforts.Sanders is not the only candidate facing high stakes, as this is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry into President Trump jolted the Democratic race.AD

AD

But Sanders, 78, may have the most riding on the debate, sponsored by CNN and the New York Times, as scrutiny of his age and endurance are greater than at any point in his nearly half-century political career.“I certainly expect that there are a lot of people who will question his age — even more than that question may have been raised before,” said Wayne Moynihan, a New Hampshire state representative who has endorsed Sanders.AD

AD

Over the weekend, Sanders hinted at his plans.Bernie has to prove that he is in as good a shape as ever.Just days later, Sanders’s daughter-in-law died of cancer at the age of 46.While Sanders is by nature a private person when he campaigns, he has opened up a bit since the heart attack.He released a seven-minute direct-to-camera video on Thursday that touched on his experience in the hospital while tying it to Medicare-for-all, an approach that advisers hope Sanders continues.He wished Sanders a speedy recovery and the two discussed the death of his daughter-in-law, Casey recalled.On a conference call last week, Sanders thanked top campaign officials and told them to take care of their own health, according to Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, who serves as a Sanders campaign co-chair.Sanders said he plans to get back on the campaign trail and that his doctors predict a full recovery, Cohen said.“I think the debate is an incredible opportunity for Bernie to reinvigorate his campaign,” Cohen said in an interview.Others who have spoken with Sanders say the signature elements of his personality — dry humor, an interest in policy and a strong desire to campaign — are coming through.AD

AD

It’s unclear, though, whether Sanders will heed the advice of confidants who want him to publicly open up about his heart attack, at the debate and beyond.And at the campaign’s outset, aides pressed Sanders to talk more about his personal story, but he soon dropped those efforts.The bigger question may be whether following his heart attack, Sanders can convince enough primary voters that his age and health should not disqualify him from a hard-fought race against an aggressive Trump, let alone a job running the country.Many Democrats, while sympathizing with Sanders, suggested his physical well-being is reasonable for Democratic voters to consider.“I feel terrible for Sen. Sanders.Like Sanders, they have agreed to release their health records before the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 3.Since he was discharged from the hospital, Sanders has repeatedly said he feels great.In an interview with CNN, Sanders said his cardiologist, who he started seeing after his heart attack, said his recovery is going “very, very well.” Asked how severe his heart attack was, Sanders would not answer directly, saying he was told that “we are on the road to a full recovery” and “within the next month, we’ll see what happens.”

His Democratic rivals have been diplomatic regarding Sanders’s condition, wishing him a speedy recovery and voicing confidence he will bounce back.“What a tough time for him — genuinely,” Steyer said, adding that he had called Sanders.And I really just wanted to send best wishes to him, and that’s all I really did.”

Asked whether an episode such as a heart attack should factor into voters’ choices, Steyer praised Sanders but did not answer directly.AD

“As the leader of the free world, it’s arguably the most stressful job, and we have to make sure our candidate is ready,” said Michael Tubbs, the mayor of Stockton, Calif. A Democrat who voted for Sanders in 2016 and is now undecided, Tubbs said age and health are fair questions for all candidates.When it comes to Sanders, several of his prominent friends and supporters have advocated cutting back on his schedule when he plunges back into campaigning.Sanders, whose campaign calendar has been much fuller than most of his rivals’, has sent mixed signals about what it will look like after Tuesday.After initially telling reporters that “we’re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit” by “probably not doing four rallies a day,” Sanders reversed himself the next day, saying in an interview with NBC News that he “misspoke” and “said a word I should not have said.” But the following day, he told to CNN that he probably will not be holding four rallies a day right away.“I think for him and his family, yes, you’d like to see him hold fewer events because his message has gained traction without him,” said Kelley Monahan, the register of deeds in Grafton County, N.H., and a Sanders supporter.Sanders’s campaign has faced questions and criticism for waiting more than two days before revealing publicly that he had a heart attack, another subject that could come up at the debate.Perhaps above all on Tuesday, it will be critical for Sanders to be self-assured, many Democrats say.In this edition: How the Democrats' one percenters (and zero percenters) are dealing with impeachment, the lopsided Trump air wars, and the Bernie Sanders advantage in the fundraising race (so far).“Bernie Sanders is in trouble,” by Holly Otterbein

Bernie Sanders speaks at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., on Sunday.Bernie Sanders.After a few weeks of “whither Sanders?” coverage, the campaign took a victory lap: It raised $25.3 million in the same quarter that it reached 1 million individual donors.In three months, 1.4 million donations had flowed into the campaign and more than 3.3 million had come since February, when Sanders entered the race.Sanders's total was the highest of any Democratic candidate so far, in any fundraising quarter.If Sanders's total surprised Democrats, who had wondered whether he was fading, so did Buttigieg's; he has fallen slightly in some trial heats of the early states, though his favorable numbers have been rising as he becomes better known.South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, announced that his campaign raised more than $19.1 million in the third quarter — less than Sanders did but an amount that gives him staying power in a crowded field.AD

Sanders (I-Vt.) transferred an additional $2.6 million from his other federal campaign accounts, the campaign said.The third-quarter figure announced by the Sanders campaign rivals his $26 million haul at this point in the primary campaign in 2015, when he stunned the Democratic field by nearly matching the total of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, with an infusion of money from donors giving less than $200.The Sanders campaign has also been dealing with staff turmoil in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.AD

But Sanders’s formidable fundraising email list, which has been without an equal in recent years, could help him weather those challenges into a crucial fall stretch.The Sanders campaign offered a glimpse of where it is spending some of its cash, announcing its first paid TV commercial of the campaign Tuesday afternoon.“In this moment, we need a fighter — Bernie Sanders,” says the narrator in a 60-second version of the commercial.The ad shows clips of Sanders speaking at campaign rallies, marching with workers and greeting supporters.AD

While Sanders’s support in the polls has fluctuated in his second run for president, his fundraising ability has been a reliable asset that has continued to stun some Democrats.In a statement, campaign manager Faiz Shakir compared Sanders’s appeal among small-dollar donors to Trump’s.Still, Sanders has supplemented his online fundraising with occasional in-person events his campaign has dubbed “grass-roots fundraisers.” The gatherings, held in big cities such as San Francisco and New York, have featured far lower entry fees than the typical private fundraisers.A week later, Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), also a Squad member, visited Sanders in his hometown of Burlington, Vt., and the two sat down for breakfast, joined by Sanders’s wife, Jane, and his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir.AD

AD

The maneuvering paid off in a big way this week, when Sanders scored one of the biggest coups of the primary season, as Omar announced late Tuesday she was endorsing him and Ocasio-Cortez plans to do the same on Saturday.A third member of the Squad, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), has opened the door to endorsing Sanders.Sanders’s campaign announced Wednesday that he will join Tlaib for a tour of her Detroit district later this month.Two weeks ago, Sanders, 78, had a heart attack that raised questions about his health, drew attention to his age and prompted doubts about the viability of his campaign.Although some in the party privately question whether the endorsements will win over many voters not already committed to Sanders, they have the potential to help him move past the most difficult chapter of his campaign, marked by falling polls as well as the heart attack.“This isn’t just about the horse race — it also helps Team Bernie turn the page from last week and start looking forward,” said Democratic strategist Rebecca Katz.“ ‘Bernie is back’ is a real thing.”

Katz was referring to the catchphrase the Sanders campaign is using to brand his return to the campaign trail after his hospitalization.After a well-received debate performance Tuesday night, Sanders plans to hold his first rally since his health scare on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., where Ocasio-Cortez will join him.AD

AD

Aides have eagerly been promoting the event and Sanders teased the rally at the debate, saying he would have a “special guest” though not identifying the person.With a large online following and high name recognition, Ocasio-Cortez could energize the rally and become a significant asset for the Sanders campaign in her home state and potentially beyond.AD

AD

In some ways, endorsing Sanders was a natural choice for Ocasio-Cortez.She worked as a volunteer for Sanders’s 2016 presidential bid and, like the senator, identifies as a democratic socialist.Both Sanders and Warren aggressively courted Ocasio-Cortez, collaborating on legislation with the congresswoman, dining with her and showing support for her on social media.Yet it was Sanders who prevailed in the endorsement chase, with an approach that mirrored his strategy for winning voters: methodical, policy-driven and consistent.Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair, said the biggest benefit of the endorsements “is the message that Bernie Sanders resonates with young people, with communities of color, with women.” Sanders has sometimes struggled to attract African American audiences.In an email to top campaign personnel Wednesday, Sanders’s political team said it was eager to roll out a new slate of state-level endorsements, but was holding off until next week to allow for more time to woo people who may have been swayed by the debate and the congressional endorsements.AD

It was after Sanders had his heart attack that Omar privately told him she would support him, according to the aide close to her, though she had long been moving in that direction.On Wednesday, the Sanders campaign released a video featuring Omar.In her Iowa speech, the ideal president she described closely resembled Sanders.Omar was swayed by Sanders primarily because of his policy positions, said her aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.AD

The one member of the Squad who has not signaled at least the possibility of endorsing Sanders is Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.But Sanders campaign officials said that trying to design an approach in anticipation of what critics will say is a faulty strategy.“Look, the haters are gonna hate regardless,” said Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign.“So why not just ride this thing on out and do it in a way where the senator has the ability to do the greatest amount of good?”

It remains unclear whether Sanders’s campaign can fully rebound following the candidate’s heart attack, which required not only a hospital stay but also the insertion of two stents in an artery and drew renewed attention to his age.But for Sanders, the past 48 hours have been some of the most productive of the race.Thirty-five percent of all money raised on ActBlue — the main online clearinghouse Democrats use to raise money — between the hours of 9 and 10 p.m. Eastern time went to Sanders, the campaign said, even though there are 18 Democrats in the race and 12 appeared on the debate stage.The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders’s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can — or should — maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign.“I would be very open about the experience he had,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign who made his pitch to the senator in a brief telephone conversation last week.“I think it can show a resilience, a sense of empathy and a sense of vulnerability.”

AD

AD

Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected.The goal, said Khanna, would be to “make a very human connection.” He said he texted the senator’s wife, Jane Sanders, last week to tell her that this could be Sanders’s “FDR moment,” referring to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose battle with polio is sometimes said to have contributed to his empathy for the less fortunate.The campaign did not immediately disclose the heart attack, initially saying only that Sanders had experienced chest pains and had two stents inserted in an artery.AD

AD

Advisers and friends also say Sanders should consider easing his breakneck campaign pace.Sanders has been sprinting across the country, holding multiple events per day, maintaining a speed that has surpassed his top rivals.“If I were giving him advice, I would tell him just slack up a little bit,” said former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who visited Sanders in a Las Vegas hospital last week.“Even if he slacks up a little bit, he’s campaigning more than anybody else.”

Sanders spent Monday recuperating at home in Burlington, Vt. On a conference call with staff, he reiterated that the movement he has been leading is not about him, a theme he often hits in campaign speeches.And our message is ‘Us, not me,’ ” Sanders said, according to a person with knowledge of his remarks.That makes the debate a critical event for the campaign, as Sanders will face considerable scrutiny from voters and rivals sizing up his health and vitality.“Bernie is raring to go, and his campaign staff has been trying to hold him back until the debate,” said Ben Cohen, who co-founded Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and serves as a national co-chair of the campaign.“The plan is for the debate to be his reentry into the race.”

AD

People with knowledge of the situation said there had been a period of uncertainty about the campaign’s future in the immediate aftermath of Sanders’s hospitalization for chest pains last week.The Iowa ad touting Sanders will be on the airwaves starting Tuesday.AD

Surrogates campaigned for Sanders in the key early states over the weekend, a strategy the campaign plans to continue.Cohen said he plans to campaign for Sanders this weekend in New Hampshire.AD

Sanders and his allies have also used his heart attack to

call attention to his push to enact a Medicare-for-all universal health-care system.They note that while Sanders was fortunate to have access to good doctors and treatment, many Americans do not.AD

And Sanders has already begun showing a more personal side of himself.When he returned to Burlington, reporters there noted Sanders saying he was “happy to be home” before walking inside where family was waiting.When he launched his second campaign for president early this year, advisers encouraged Sanders to speak about his participation in the civil rights movement and his modest upbringing in Brooklyn.His Democratic ­rivals have either wished Sanders well or brushed aside questions about his physical fitness for office.These external events have led some Sanders allies to conclude that he does not have to rush back onto the national stage.“His volunteers can do a lot of the work and he just needs to focus on recovering.”

AD

In a sign of how the Sanders movement has charged ahead without him on the trail, a video created by a supporter arguing that he’s been criticized unfairly by the media had received 6 million views as of late Monday.As Sanders recovers, his campaign has taken steps to reassure staffers and supporters, scheduling calls and other outreach to keep allies focused.They gave me the details, which made me feel really comfortable,” said Deb Marlin, an Iowa small-business owner who has endorsed Sanders.Reid recalled spending 30 to 45 minutes with Sanders on Thursday.As for the next debate, Reid said Sanders ought to take things slowly before then.Sanders thanked well-wishers Wednesday and used the moment to draw attention to his signature universal-health-care proposal.AD

AD

The problem emerged at a critical moment for Sanders and the Democratic campaign.Facing a younger crop of Democratic candidates running on generational change, Biden, Warren and Sanders have sought creative ways to project youthfulness and vigor.Sanders played in a summer softball game and reminds voters he used to be a competitive runner.AD

“I think you look at the totality of a candidate,” Sanders said recently on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” responding to concerns about his age voiced by former president Jimmy Carter, himself 95.AD

An artery blockage such as Sanders’s typically has a good prognosis and does not normally require a long time to bounce back from, medical experts said.“Often they can be back to work in days, and certainly within weeks.”

AD

Nissen said he does not think age was a big factor in Sanders’s case, but “clearly if you’re older, you do have other issues that may come up.”

Coronary arteries, which feed blood to the heart muscle, can become blocked over time, and as the artery narrows it reduces blood flow and can cause chest pains.When a patient such as Sanders comes in complaining of chest pains, doctors usually perform an angiogram to diagnose the problem, said Elizabeth Klodas, a cardiologist in Minneapolis.AD

AD

When the chest pains struck Sanders on Tuesday, he was in the midst of a busy campaign swing that took him from New Hampshire to Nevada.That’s consistent with Sanders’s breakneck campaign pace in recent months.But there have been signs that the aggressive clip has taken a toll on Sanders.AD

AD

In March, Sanders received seven stitches on his head after what a spokeswoman described as an injury from the edge of a glass shower door.Injuries and illnesses, even those that are not severe, can present challenges for a campaign, and it’s not clear whether Sanders’s latest health issues will factor into how voters see him.AD

It was unclear late Wednesday how long Sanders would be off the campaign trail or if the episode would change his approach to the race.A campaign spokesman declined to immediately provide more details about Sanders’s condition but said he was recovering at a Las Vegas hospital.Before Wednesday’s news, the Sanders campaign had been planning to plow ahead aggressively in the key early nominating states and to air its first ad.Campaign manager Faiz Shakir had told supporters on a call that the campaign would be “up on the air aggressively over the next few weeks leading up to the debate on October 15.”

Sanders’s Democratic primary opponents, meanwhile, wished him a swift recovery Wednesday.“I’m sure Bernie will be back on the trail soon.Booker added, “Whatever you want to think about Bernie Sanders, I think most of America agrees that is one tough guy.”Carter attended the funeral in Washington, along with President Trump and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and, of course, Bush’s son George W.

AD

Carter says he takes pride in having “always told the truth.” He also says he is proud that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “comported themselves with dignity, talked about issues that matter and presented a vision for our nation,” during the 2016 presidential election.And be sure to vote.”

Last month, at a Carter Center event, the former president, who voted for Sanders in Georgia’s 2016 Democratic primary, said he is keeping “an open mind” about the 2020 Democratic candidates.And now the government can basically decide, you know, all of the medical research that gets done,'” Zuckerberg said in response to a question about Sanders’s call to eliminate billionaires.… I fundamentally believe in that competition that you want different ideas out there.”

Zuckerberg made similar comments at a Facebook town hall event recently when asked by a company employee about Sanders’s remarks on eliminating billionaires.“What I worry about a little bit when I hear sentiments like what the senator suggested is the suggestion that this should all be done publicly would deprive the market and world of a kind of diversity of different attempts that can be taken.”

AD

Sanders, a 2020 presidential candidate, told the New York Times last month while introducing his wealth tax that he does not think billionaires should exist.AD

Sanders’s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those with assets over $32 million and then increases that rate in steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.AD

Sanders defended his opposition to the existence of billionaires at the most recent Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, saying, “We cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.”

AD

In his Fox remarks, Zuckerberg defended the right of people to be richly rewarded for their work while showing some sympathy for the view that people do not deserve to be billionaires.He would owe the federal government an additional $5.5 billion in taxes in the first year of Sanders’s proposed tax, should it ever be enacted, according to Sanders’ campaign.Had Sanders’s plan been enacted decades ago, Zuckerberg would have been worth $29 billion in 2018 rather than $61 billion, according to research by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two left-leaning economists who have advised Sanders.As a result, she wins these states with about 51.1 percent of the national popular vote, compared to last-place Sanders with about 52.5 percent.They include one to whom the Sanders campaign referred The Washington Post.Robert Pollin, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has consulted with Sanders, said he has been baffled by how the senator from Vermont talks about the proposal and says there are not enough details to analyze how the middle class would be impacted.AD

AD

The Sanders campaign said it would be able to address that question with more precision after it releases a comprehensive plan on reforming the nation’s tax laws.Sanders has said that his plan would be paid for in part with higher middle-class taxes, something that Warren has declined to directly acknowledge.“If you’re making more than $29,000, in a progressive way, you will be paying more in taxes,” Sanders said in an interview conducted before his recent hospitalization.“But the increased taxes that you’re paying will be significantly less than what you were paying for premiums, co-payments and out of pocket expenses.”

AD

AD

Yet, in the way Sanders has outlined his proposal, that statement won’t apply to everyone.The Sanders campaign has sought to frame the debate over Medicare-for-all in personal terms, emphasizing how it would address the catastrophic financial toll health-care costs have taken on some Americans under the current system.“I’m with Bernie,” she said at the first debate, signaling to fans of his plan that they would also have a champion in her.The campaign pointed to Warren’s previous statements pledging to not raise overall costs on middle-class families but would not outline how she would accomplish that with a plan that many economists, as well as Sanders, say will require significant tax hikes.(Sanders also has proposed assistance for those workers.)Sanders estimates that his plan would cost $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years.AD

A portion of the revenue for Sanders’s plan would come from an additional 4 percent tax on income for families making more than $29,000, which he estimates would raise $3.5 trillion.Although Sanders would levy the payroll tax only on employers with payrolls over $2 million, economists generally assume that all payroll tax increases are passed along to workers in the form of wage cuts, slower wage increases or job losses.Sanders has argued that his plan would be cheaper than maintaining the status quo — putting forward a $50 trillion figure to maintain current health-care spending over the next 10 years — but fact-checkers have said that figure is dubious.Sanders also has provided estimates for a family of four earning $50,000.Thorpe’s analysis of the Medicare-for-all plan that Sanders outlined in 2016 found that about 71 percent of those with private insurance would pay more in new taxes than they would save by having health insurance covered by the federal government.Thorpe estimated Sanders’s plan is underfunded and would need higher taxes than he has proposed; Sanders’s updated health-care plan, released this year, imposed higher taxes than his earlier proposal but still not as high as Thorpe says would be needed.And most envision expanding care which means you’re spending more unless you dramatically cut the price per service.”

Pollin, the professor who has briefed the Sanders campaign on his plan, said his in-depth study of how Medicare-for-all would work was paid for by National Nurses United, which has backed Sanders and supported Medicare-for-all.Pollin briefed the campaign, and Sanders himself, on his findings.But that is not the same as Sanders’s plan.AD

AD

Let’s start with the fact that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), one of the leading candidates throughout the campaign, just had a heart attack.Nevertheless, because Sanders is 78 years old, one reaction I’ve heard from Democrats (to be clear, I’m not talking about public officials, just people I know) was “Well, that’s too bad, but his campaign is probably over.”

If that seems unfair, it certainly is.Sanders doesn’t have a history of heart problems that would suggest his life is in imminent danger.AD

AD

Like many assumptions about what other people believe, the idea that the public would reject Sanders because of his age and health is based less on hard evidence than gut feeling.Consider Sanders’s campaign website, which features a page literally titled “Anti-Endorsements.” “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made,” the Sanders page says, followed by a list of famous people, mostly from the worlds of business and finance, who have criticized him.Upon unveiling the list, Sanders said, “These people have a vested interest in preserving the status quo so they can keep their grip on power so they can continue to exploit working people across America.” He added this flourish: “We welcome their hatred."(Sanders is recovering at home after suffering a heart attack on Oct. 1 and has vowed to return to campaigning soon.)AD

AD

What were the hateful things said about Sanders?To take one example, JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon made the list for saying about Sanders’s economic populism, “Just because it resonates doesn’t make it right.” Frankly, that doesn’t qualify as “hatred” in my book — more like “mild disagreement” — but it was enough to deem him an enemy.While Sanders has employed the anti-endorsement in its barest form, he is far from alone, of course.Sanders has not shied away from telling voters they will have to pay higher taxes under a Medicare-for-all plan.“At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health-care bills,” Sanders said at last week’s debate in Ohio.In a Sunday interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg scoffed at the idea that Warren might use “pay-fors” previously sketched out by Sanders.“Right now, whether you copy-paste the Bernie Sanders math or do it some other way, there is a hole amounting to trillions of dollars in how this is supposed to work.”

Single-payer advocates have been frustrated by the tax and cost debate, pointing out that the cost of the entire program — usually pegged at $30 trillion over 10 years — does not factor in how much taxpayers shell out for insurance under the current system.AD

AD

The aborted hire is a parable about how the effort to harness organic online ingenuity, built on distrust of the mainstream media and turned into one of Sanders’s main tactical advantages, can backfire.“When you see someone you support being misrepresented, that’s what inspires the grass roots,” Orfalea said, explaining why the pro-Sanders video gained so much traction.Sanders, in his second run for the Democratic nomination, enjoys an online following that dwarfs that of his rivals.AD

AD

Crucially, Sanders is also able to turn the enthusiasm into cash, recently raising more than $25 million in the third quarter, fueled by legions of small-dollar donors.Orfalea’s video promoting Sanders was a vivid illustration of how the 78-year-old’s fans make him go viral, circumventing mainstream gatekeepers to present a more favorable account of their candidate.“What Bernie does is relay that sense of grievance from his most passionate supporters,” said Ethan Porter, an assistant professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.AD

The charge that Sanders is “a not pro-woman candidate” was juxtaposed with a clip of the senator’s rapturous reception at the 2017 Women’s March.The notion that Sanders “doesn’t actually smile that much” was followed by clips of the senator beaming.In a dramatic close, complaints that Sanders is too loud were interspersed with the verdict of a mother of a diabetic son that “We are not being vocal enough.” The video was set to music from “The Green Mile,” the 1999 fantasy crime drama adapted from the Stephen King novel.The video has been viewed nearly 7 million times on Twitter, posted by the activist Shaun King, who was then retweeted by the Sanders campaign’s official account.“Change happens from organic momentum,” said Keegan Goudiss, Sanders’s director of digital advertising in 2016 and now a partner at Revolution Messaging.AD

He concentrated on making his own videos, including about politics, and became enamored of Sanders during his 2016 bid for the presidency.“Now I’m editing the real real world,” he said, noting the convergence of politics and entertainment and arguing that someone schooled in the ways of reality television could help defeat Trump, who rose to national prominence on “The Apprentice.”

As his video, titled “Rising Up,” picked up steam, a Twitter message arrived from Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Sanders.Bernie Sanders camp just got some new blood to go with that new heart upgrade.”

On Friday, the campaign shared the video in an email blast to supporters, with the subject line “These folks HATE Bernie Sanders.”

The same day, Orfalea signed a contract, and on Saturday, he recorded a video for his followers, sharing the “big, big news” that he was joining the campaign.Within hours, a 53-year-old Sanders critic in New York, Michele Ferrer, dredged up old videos on his channel, which included offensive language and an altered and sexualized rendition of King’s “I Have a Dream” speech.That vetting process had not yet been completed.”

In the celebratory message to his followers, which may now never go live, Orfalea said he had received scads of notes from viewers about how the video had helped them get through to a family member or friend initially turned off by negative coverage of Sanders.You said what you said, and the fact is after that exchange with Jonathan Karl, you were asked another time why the aid was held up, what was the condition for the aid, and you didn’t mention two conditions, you mentioned three conditions.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) defends his progressive turf.Bernie Sanders returned to the campaign trail in New York on Saturday for a rally with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who delivered to him one of the most sought-after endorsements in progressive politics and called for a ‘mass mobilization’ of young, working class voters in 2020.”

At least one senator is defending decency and conservative values.and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.),” Politico reported in August.(75 percent) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (84 percent), South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (95 percent) and Andrew Yang (43 percent).Sanders was next in line at $21.3 million.AD

For the second quarter in a row, Sanders pulled in a little over $25 million and narrowly outpaced the second-place candidate.Sanders also has the most cash on hand, at $33.7 million — a number buoyed by $12.7 million in transfers from his old campaign committee.It’s all unacceptable, and we’ve got to do better.”

Bernie Sanders: In his first debate after suffering a heart attack, he seemed more lively than he has been at any previous one.“Are you suggesting I’m Vladimir Putin?” Sanders asked before the two men embraced.At another point, Cory Booker noted that Sanders supports medical marijuana, and Sanders responded, “But I’m not on it tonight.” Sanders has been accused of sometimes being humorless and a little dry — even overly angry.The fact that she passed each time wasn’t surprising — she instead focuses on total costs going down for the middle class, including health care — but she did get pushback from across the stage, including from Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke and even gently from Sanders, who again forthrightly admitted taxes would go up under his plan.The most recent defense of Gabbard came from Clinton’s 2016 rival — Sen.

There has been a lot of chatter about Trump’s verbal acuity and mental state, but the issue is not him per se or Sanders or any other individual contender.In effect, they will be nothing short of an advertisement for the campaign of the Democratic nominee for president in 2020, especially if that nominee is Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, both of whom want to impose wealth taxes and make it harder for people such as Trump to cheat, remaking the tax code so that the wealthy pay something resembling their fair share.If you believe, sensibly, that removing the 45th is a precondition for all improvements, you should want Sanders’s coming defeat in the Democratic nomination scramble to be postponed for a while.Saturday’s rally was Sanders’s announcement that he, like the Young Man in Longfellow’s poem, is “up and doing, with a heart for any fate.” His message was: Never mind my heart attack.Her persona, that of a hectoring schoolmarm, can be grating, but is less so than his, which recalls Dorothy Parker’s description of Katharine Hepburn: “She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.” Sanders fluctuates between anger and indignation.(Brian Snyder/Reuters)

Sen. Bernie Sanders allowed film crews to take this footage as he recovers from last week's heart attack:There will be 12 candidates onstage, but expectations are highest for Biden, Warren and Sanders.Sen. Sanders (I-Vt.), who delivered three strong debate performances in a row, is facing his lowest expectations ever, thanks to the health scare and sagging poll numbers.And nine candidates will walk behind their microphones in a markedly weaker position than Sanders.A noticeable fatigue has set in with Democratic campaigns about the focus on Medicare-for-all — not the concept, but the specific legislation sponsored by Sanders.But over the first three debates, more time was spent discussing the intricacies of Sanders's bill than on any other single issue.For Sanders, it's more complicated: Warren is the only co-sponsor of Medicare-for-all in the race who hasn't backed down from it in some way, but it's his legislation, and he knows that one reason some Democrats prefer Warren to him because they don't expect her to stake her presidency on it.The third debates began with moderators saying that Warren and Sanders wanted to “replace Obamacare” and Biden didn't want to “scrap it,” exactly the framing that Biden uses on the trail.“Bernie Sanders’s plan would force country’s largest corporations to share profits with workers,” by Chelsea Janes and Jeff Stein

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble in his first public appearance since suffering a heart attack two weeks ago.“At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” Klobuchar said.Sanders defended his Medicare-for-all plan, which would provide everyone with government-sponsored health care and would largely abolish the private health-care industry.Sanders referred to it glancingly toward the end of the debate, calling the vote “disastrous.”

Candidates instead went fiercely after Trump, whom Booker accused of “moral weakness” and a “dumpster fire” policy.Sanders chimed in.“At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this, and that taxes are going to go up,” Klobuchar said.(Biden, 76, also leaned into a question about his age: “With it comes wisdom.”)

-- Sanders may be fading in the polls, but he remains a force to be reckoned with on Warren’s left flank.Sanders doesn’t have much range, but he showed his sense of humor.Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), another member of the “Squad,” backed Sanders by sending out a news release shortly after the debate.“On Tuesday, Sanders unveiled legislation with Omar to enact a universal school meals program.”

-- Another indicator that Biden is not a front-runner came in lackluster campaign finance filings released late last night: His campaign struggled to gain financial steam in the past three months — spending money at a faster clip and entering this month with a smaller campaign war chest than his leading competitors, Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy report.Sanders had $33.7 million cash on hand at the end of the quarter.Newsweek’s Harriet Sinclair calls Warren the “force to be reckoned with,” as Biden floundered and Buttigieg and Sanders impressed.CNN’s Chris Cillizza picked Buttigieg, Yang, Klobuchar and Sanders as the winners.Business Insider said Buttigieg had the strongest performance of the night, followed by Sanders, Klobuchar and Yang.Sanders and Buttigieg were his “surprise winners.” Biden was his biggest loser, followed by the rest of the 2020 hopefuls.That was less than a third of the stockpile enjoyed by Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg, and the gap elevated fears of allies about his ability to compete if a contentious primary fight runs deep into next spring.The former vice president sought to focus instead on the lively squabble over Warren’s liberal policies, particularly on health care, where she has largely yielded to Sanders.Sanders, the author of the Medicare-for-all plan, has acknowledged it will require increased taxes.That’s a fact.”

Sanders, meanwhile, enjoyed a positive jolt from the debate, his first formal appearance since having a heart attack two weeks ago.After the debate, two prominent congresswomen — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — endorsed Sanders, giving him another boost.Biden on Wednesday dismissed concerns about his financing, and he pointed toward the advantage Warren and Sanders had in transferring money from their Senate accounts.They did not provide details on what 'other revenue options' the campaign is studying, and declined to comment on whether Warren may eventually put out her own details on paying for Medicare for All.”

-- Despite falling behind Warren and Biden in the polls, Sanders scored one of the biggest coups of the primary season by securing the endorsements of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).Sean Sullivan and Chelsea Janes detail how he did it: “Ocasio-Cortez ... visited Sanders in his hometown of Burlington, Vt., and the two sat down for breakfast, joined by Sanders’s wife, Jane, and his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir.… A third member of the Squad, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), has opened the door to endorsing Sanders.Sanders’s campaign announced Wednesday that he will join Tlaib for a tour of her Detroit district later this month.Both Sanders and Warren aggressively courted Ocasio-Cortez, collaborating on legislation with the congresswoman, dining with her and showing support for her on social media."“I think the only person in the military that Mr. Trump doesn’t think is overrated is Colonel Sanders,” Mattis said, an allusion to the president’s fondness for Kentucky Fried Chicken and other fast food.and Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), two of the top-polling candidates in the Democratic field, will participate.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned 9% support, the same number as in the June poll.Buttigieg ‘has found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders.Warren’s office dismissed the notion that she’s even a little bit accommodating toward K Street.”

-- After a rally for Sanders that drew an estimated 26,000 people in Queens on Saturday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said her endorsement was an “authentic decision.” She told CBS there were no "political calculations" behind the decision.Saturday "was Sanders’s first campaign appearance since his Oct. 1 heart attack, after which he had two stents inserted into a blocked artery in a Las Vegas hospital.Graphika, a social media analysis firm that examined the operation for Facebook, published a 30-page report about the fake pages, which were still in audience-building mode: “Multiple accounts praised Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump.... 'I would not rule it out, but it’s not, to me, the first and best choice.’”

-- Bernie Sanders defended Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) against claims she is a “Russian asset,” calling the suggestion “outrageous.” From CNN: “‘Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,’ the Vermont independent tweeted.‘People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.’ Sanders does not name Hillary Clinton in the tweet, but his comments appear to be aimed at the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee … Clinton's team on Monday declined to comment to CNN about Sanders' tweet.Some of the accounts boosted one of his rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).”

Ben Nimmo, a researcher at the social media analysis firm Graphika, said the Russian actors tried not to be detected by reposting content from real users, including Sanders.Unlike many health-care bills, this one, introduced in 2017 and 2019 by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), did not include “pay-fors” in the legislative text.Stephanie Kelton, an economist who has advised Sanders, argued that the conventional Washington thinking was “truly dysfunctional,” asking policymakers to come up with “pay-fors” to get past the CBO, when real government spending could be more flexible.Sanders, in particular, proposed a series of plans for debt forgiveness, free college and climate change, pointing out that Republicans had already stopped pretending that every plan needed to be deficit-neutral.In the fourth debate last week, center-left rivals repeatedly contrasted Warren with Sanders — “at least he's being honest,” Klobuchar said — because she refused to say that “middle-class taxes” would go up to pay for Medicare-for-all, saying instead that “costs” would go down.Her supporters repeatedly point out her 2016 decision to quit a role at the Democratic National Committee and endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as proof that she is simply a target of party leaders who can’t control her.(Bernie Sanders had come to Chicago the night before the strike, urging members to do it.)Bernie Sanders.But the split for Warren is 55 percent to 24 percent, and for Sanders it is 54 percent to 29 percent.in first with 28 percent, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (who, like Klobuchar, has focused on Iowa) surprisingly comes in second with 20 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 18 percent and former vice president Joe Biden at 12 percent.So far, the debate next month will include Biden, Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, Harris, Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), a manageable group in which the majority of those onstage have a reasonable path to the nomination.2016 winner: Bernie Sanders

No part of the state showcased the gap between traditional Democratic strength and Clinton's problems like southeast Iowa, a string of small and often-shrinking communities that bolted the party's nominee in the 2016 general election, while reelecting Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack.For the past few years, it has been “paid for” only in the abstract — Sanders had laid out some potential ways to make up the cost, without getting specific about which he preferred.The biggest beneficiary of that has been Sanders, which means that fully half of primary voters see the most left-wing candidates as the most compelling founts of policy.But the state's Democrats look ready to repeat their recent pattern of backing a more liberal candidate: The combined vote for Warren and Sanders outpaces the vote for Biden by 10 points.(Sanders easily defeated Clinton here in 2016.)Massachusetts Democratic primary (WBUR/MassINC, 456 registered voters)

Bernie Sanders.Sanders (I-Vt.) tore into Biden's decision during a campaign stop in Iowa, then told CBS News's Cara Korte that he was proud to have led the field in fundraising without ever holding a traditional fundraiser.Sanders pioneered that strategy in 2016.Right to Rise went after Bush's rivals, drawing no blood, while Priorities USA Action did nothing to attack Sanders on Clinton's behalf.It did not spend in the primary until after Sanders overwhelmingly won the New Hampshire primary, and only then did it begin running get-out-the-vote messaging for Clinton, not attacks on Sanders.No Democratic candidate for president has said that he or she would shut down Priorities USA Action — not even Warren or Sanders, who have proposed new limits on the party's corporate fundraising and who have pledged not to do traditional fundraisers.In 2012, when the super PAC issue was fresh, even Sanders argued that victory was more important than a single fundraising principle.“Should you be principled, and allow your opponent to spend huge sums of money?” Sanders asked, rhetorically, in a conversation with Vermont's Seven Days newspaper.READING LIST

“That is one way of saying it,” Sanders replied.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at the J Street National Conference on Monday in Washington.Sanders, who got a standing ovation before and after his remarks, repeatedly said that the $3.8 billion in aid Americans give to Israel should be used as leverage to “fundamentally change” the country’s approach toward Palestinian land and rights.“It is a lot of money, and we cannot give carte blanche to the Israeli government, or for that matter to any government at all,” Sanders said.“I would say that some of the $3.8 billion should go right now to humanitarian aid in Gaza.”

No other candidate for the nomination went quite as far as Sanders.“U.S./Israel ties must supersede politics.”

(Asked about the conversation at J Street's conference, JDCA board Chairman Ron Klein reiterated that his group did “not support reducing or conditioning assistance to Israel.”)

But Ocasio-Cortez has brought attention to a simmering discussion, one that Sanders was the first 2020 candidate to engage in.“You're looking at two leaders, one who's going to be impeached, the other one may end up in jail,” Sanders said Monday, referring to Trump and Netanyahu.That was a success, in large part due to delegates elected to support Sanders.Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Klobuchar have seen positive trends, of different kinds; almost nothing good has been happening for Biden.He continues to lag behind Warren and Sanders among voters naming their second choice, which has been true for a while and which remains worrying for a race that will take place after Iowa shrinks the field.Sanders has recovered since July but not to the levels he was at the start of 2019, when he dominated New Hampshire.Warren is also viewed as the winner of the last debate, even though Sanders is viewed as having better policies on climate change and foreign policy.Bernie Sanders.The other movement: In the period around the third and fourth debates, there more interest in Buttigieg than in Sanders, who had led Buttigieg on this metric in debates one and two.(Paul Sancya/AP)

Sen. Bernie Sanders's interview with John Harwood spelled out some contrasts with his allies, distancing him from Democratic Socialists of America (he does not want to eliminate private corporations) and taking a low-key swipe at Sen. Elizabeth Warren's law work (“I have never worked for a corporation myself”).“You’re asking me to come up with an exact detailed plan of how every American — how much you’re going to pay more in taxes, how much I’m going to pay,” Sanders said.At the moment, Sanders's opponents are fine with that — because they're more nervous about Warren.Sanders said that “for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses,” and instead of pressing him for details, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) praised him.“At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” Klobuchar said.“Even after Medicare-for-all endures the most effective attacks, support surges right back to 50 percent or higher if our side just bothers to make the case.”

There is no Warren plan to test yet, though, and were Warren to decrease as a threat, Democrats are comfortable asking Sanders the same question: Seriously, how does he pay for it?Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)Bernie Sanders: We’re trying to pay for the damn thing.Bernie Sanders: The fight right now is to get the American people to understand that we’re spending twice as much per capita, that of course, we can pay for it.Bernie Sanders: I’m not saying it’s foolish.“The end of the year is the deadline still, and I certainly think it ought to happen before Iowa,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a supporter of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Sanders pulls 21 percent, while Warren follows him at 18 percent, which is within the margin of error.-- Sanders has gained key endorsements from some of the country’s most powerful Latinas, leading some to believe that he might have a shot in capturing the Latinx vote, which has huge sway potential but low turnout numbers.From Politico: “Sanders' star support from prominent Latinas ‘gives him barrio cred, street cred for this old white Jewish dude who is running for president,’ said Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens.… There’s also the reality that Sanders probably can’t win the Democratic nomination without Latinos, since his campaign is relying on a strong finish in states such as Nevada and California.Speaking to a crowd of hundreds of Latinos at a LULAC town hall in Iowa last week, Sanders received the loudest welcome of any presidential candidate in attendance, rousing the audience as he took the stage."-- Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (R) mocked Sanders and Michigan Rep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) underscored the ongoing significance of the battle for the party’s progressive wing by endorsing Sanders, who strengthened his hand with a solid performance.Her rise depended on her ability, simultaneously, to pull left-wing Democrats away from Sanders while also gaining new support from more moderate progressives.The accusation highlights the animating tension in the field between more populist candidates and moderates: Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are pushing for a structural overhaul of the economy while many of the others are focused on more incremental change.AD

AD

Warren and Sanders have called for attacking that growth in inequality with a tax on the accumulated assets of the wealthy, while the other presidential candidates have proposed more modest measures such as increasing taxes on the capital income of investors.“With the exception of Warren and Sanders, most Democratic proposals deal with what’s coming into people’s pocketbook — but not the stock of wealth people have already accumulated, which is way too much already.”

AD

The debate reflected the rising prominence of the idea of a wealth tax, as both Warren and Sanders have forced the other candidates to respond to their plan.AD

Sanders would hit more people with his wealth tax plan, and would also significantly increase how much it would take from the very wealthiest.AD

Sanders’s plan, which he says would help reduce the billionaire class in America, introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those with assets over $32 million and then increases that rate in steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.The debate over the wealth tax played out along familiar lines at the fourth debate, as other rivals of Sanders and Warren sought to distance themselves from the idea.“We’re going to have a special guest at that event,” Sanders said.That Warren and Sanders share broadly similar political philosophies is a problem for him, a problem compounded by his recent health issues.So kill multiple birds with one stone: a big rally and a big endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, arguably the new standard-bearer for the political ideology that Sanders popularized in 2016.But it’s worth asking: How does the Ocasio-Cortez endorsement actually help Sanders?The first is that Ocasio-Cortez is popular with voters with whom Sanders needs some help.Sanders is a distant third.Warren leads Sanders by 27 points with women, for example, and by the same margin with white Democratic voters.Quinnipiac has polled on the favorability of both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, most recently in September for the senator and March for Ocasio-Cortez.Overall, Sanders is more favorably viewed than Ocasio-Cortez nearly across the board.But, then, far more people have no opinion of Ocasio-Cortez than of Sanders, thanks to the senator’s having been involved in politics for far longer.About 8 percent of Democratic voters didn’t have an opinion of Sanders.For example, 85 percent of Democratic voters with an opinion of her in March viewed her favorably — about nine points higher than Sanders’s adjusted favorability.Among women with an opinion of both, Ocasio-Cortez is more favorably viewed than Sanders by 14 points.AD

All groups with which Sanders needs to do better.The campaign’s hope is clearly in part that Ocasio-Cortez’s popularity there could bolster Sanders’s own.It’s not a sure thing, certainly; some voters will probably adjust their opinions of Ocasio-Cortez following her endorsement and not their opinions of Sanders.But Ocasio-Cortez offers a big splash at an important moment with constituencies that Sanders needs to convert to his candidacy.Which brings us to the other way in which Ocasio-Cortez helps: By endorsing Sanders, she’s not hurting him.It would also suggest that an influential leftist sees Warren, not Sanders, as the best carrier of the movement’s banner, a shift that would have been a massive blow to the senator from Vermont.Even if Ocasio-Cortez doesn’t significantly move voters to Sanders, it was important for Sanders’s team to ensure that she didn’t pull voters away.It will be hard to know the effect, given the simultaneous combination of Sanders’s strong debate performance, reentry into the race and the endorsement.Sanders’s candidacy fights on.I suspect that she expected fellow candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to be much more formidable and figured he would run her over with the health-care issue among progressive voters.“You have half a million people sleeping out on the street today.”

Saturday’s rally, billed as a “Bernie’s Back” presidential campaign event, was Sanders’s first since suffering a heart attack on Oct. 1 and having two stents inserted to clear a blocked artery.Over the past week, Sanders has restored his standing as a force in the fluid Democratic race with a debate performance that won positive reviews, high-profile endorsements and strong fundraising that has expanded a campaign account already flush with cash.In her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez delivered an impassioned explanation for why she decided to support Sanders, saying “the only reason that I had any hope in launching a long-shot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved you can run a grass-roots campaign and win in an America where we almost thought that was impossible.”

She hugged Sanders after he walked onstage.The senator’s wife, Jane Sanders, said her husband was healthy and eager to get back to the campaign.Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore dismissed the notion that Sanders’s age is a liability and won cheers for saying that Wall Street would be the one having a heart attack when Sanders is elected.AD

The Sanders campaign has promised to release his health records by the end of the year.Sanders has not disclosed details about how much damage his heart sustained.And his team waited more than two days to reveal his diagnosis despite persistent questions from reporters, drawing some criticism and questions about transparency that Sanders has said were unwarranted.Sanders’s anti-establishment message and democratic socialist platform calling for sweeping expansion of the social safety net have made him a rock star on the party’s left.AD

Sanders supporters are confident the endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez, an electrifying figure who is part of a youthful coalition of Democrats who rose to power in the 2018 midterms, will help address some of those weaknesses.Sanders also recently won the endorsement of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who, like Ocasio-Cortez, is a member of an influential group of liberal congresswomen of color known as “the Squad.”

“It’s uniting different generations of Democrats,” said Jonathan Glasser, 61, a South Orange, N.J., resident who attended the event.But behind the scenes, Sanders worked diligently to secure their support, an effort that paid off at a moment he needed most.AD

Bryan Charlot, a 25-year-old from Manhattan, said he felt Sanders had gotten an unfair reputation that Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement could remedy.AD

Sanders wrote his Saturday speech himself, aides said, honing it over the past couple of days.“Find someone you don’t know — maybe somebody who doesn’t look like you,” Sanders told the crowd as he wrapped up his remarks.AD

Sanders also accused some unnamed Democrats of believing “that real change is not possible,” including some rivals he debated Tuesday night.While Sanders chose to make his return to the campaign trail in New York, he and his top aides are focusing heavily on another state.The campaign intends to extend its current television ad buy there, and Sanders plans to kick off an “End Corporate Greed Tour” in a few days.AD

In 2016, Sanders fought Hillary Clinton to a near draw in Iowa.One man came dressed in an oversize Sanders mask and held up a sign that said “Enough i$ Enough!” The crowd broke into chants of “We will win!” The distinct anti-establishment atmosphere that has been evident at Sanders’s events this year was clear as speakers railed against large corporations to cheers.Few, if any, politicians have cultivated a core following as devoted as the one Sanders has built since his emergence on the national stage as a presidential candidate four years ago.“And ready to make a difference,” added Mosdell, who came from Millburn, N.J., wearing a Sanders T-shirt.AD

Some in the crowd said they were not worried about any lingering effects of Sanders’s heart attack.AD

Thanks to a huge network of small-dollar donors, Sanders started October with $33.7 million in his campaign account, a hefty sum that ensures he will have the resources to compete in early states and is not in any danger of running low on cash in the near future.Still, questions remained about what tack Sanders will take in the months ahead.On Saturday, Sanders seemed to heed their input, framing his health situation as a way to talk about what he says are severe economic, social and health-care issues facing people every day.Sanders and his surrogates used the setting — a park across the river from Manhattan high-rises and across the street from the largest housing project in the country — to highlight the effects of income inequality and the reasons various government programs do not received their prescribed funding.Several of them said that while they’d be reluctant to bring corporate clients to meet with Warren’s leading progressive rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), they’d have no qualms about having them sit down with Warren."(Her math should be interesting, since even the more forthcoming Sen.

— Nearly three weeks after his heart attack, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stood before a crowd of more than 25,000 in New York, accepting an endorsement from Rep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) embraces Bernie Sanders at rally in Queens:and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by seven points each.Trump’s high against Sanders is the same: one lonely 48 percent poll in which he was nonetheless losing.“If we’re stuck chasing immigrants or trade deals while artificial intelligence is about to lead the land, we are sunk.”

As he did at the fourth Democratic debate last week, Yang lightly criticized a wealth tax — such as the one fellow candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)One nugget from CNN’s poll should encourage Biden: "Biden and Sanders do their best in the primary among voters who say they are certain of their vote choice, while Warren voters are much more likely to say they may change their mind.”

In the midst of the absolute chaos Trump has created in Syria and the revelations of the extent to which he has corrupted and deformed U.S. foreign policy, Biden might have an edge.Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.Robert Pollin, a left-leaning economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has worked with the Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) teams, said he believes two-thirds of the single-payer fund can be raised by redirecting existing public health-care spending from Medicare, Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs.But Warren co-sponsored Sanders’s Medicare-for-all bill in 2017 and stuck with it even as other Democratic presidential candidates who backed the bill have since distanced themselves from that plan.AD

But unlike Sanders, Warren has refused to say whether taxes for the middle class would go up under her plan.Sanders says middle-class families would still come out ahead under his plan because their spending on health care would vanish.AD

Sanders has released a suite of potential options to finance Medicare-for-all, including a 4 percent payroll tax hike that would affect the working class, but he has not committed to one financing mechanism.AD

Sanders’s plan would move everyone in the country onto one government insurer, including the approximately 30 million people without insurance and the more than 150 million people who receive their health care from their employer.Critics have raised objections about Sanders’s proposal, including the potential political ramifications of mandating that millions of people with employer-based care move to a government system.(Sanders is about even in all three cases.)It will be interesting to see how the math works given that she has signed onto the enhanced Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but promised not to increase total costs for the middle class.Sanders has conceded that he would apply a 4 percent tax to everyone making at least $29,000 and would also enact a new 7.5 percent payroll tax, which would in part be shouldered by middle-class workers (if paid by the employer, it is reasonable to assume that the result would be lower pay for workers to account for the new expense).The kind of enhanced single-payer plan Sanders and Warren are talking about includes “eliminating all cost-sharing requirements, adding additional benefits for adult dental, vision, and hearing care and LTSS [long-term services and supports].Kenneth E. Thorpe of Emory (who advised the failed Medicare-for-all program in Vermont) found that “the new federal revenues needed would exceed $32 Trillion over the next decade, Senator Sanders has himself stated that the Federal budgetary cost would be over $30 trillion over a decade.” Thorpe explained:

The Vermont version was a less generous version of Medicare for All (they retained cost sharing of 6 to 13 percent).... All of Sanders options together raise about $15 trillion over ten years – far short of the over $30 trillion he proposes to pay for this.Sanders’s plan, which aims to overhaul an approach he argues has unfairly hurtminorities, calls for using executive power to reclassify marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance and passing legislation to permanently legalize the drug.“It has disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans.”

In his 2016 campaign, Sanders struggled to persuade African American voters to support him, and many instead gravitated to Hillary Clinton.Sanders released his marijuana plan a day before the start of the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at Benedict College, a historically black institution in Columbia, S.C. South Carolina is an important early nominating state where African Americans are expected to account for a majority of Democratic primary voters.Sanders and eight other Democrats are scheduled to speak at the forum over the next three days.AD

Biden’s proposal is less far-reaching than those of Sanders and Warren.Sanders, who is running on a platform of curtailing income inequality and reining in the power of big companies, says he would create provisions to prevent large corporations from dominating the market.The Sanders plan would also use taxes on marijuana sales to help promote minority businesses.and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — who have made fighting against wealthy political interests a centerpiece of their campaigns.AD

“The former vice president has been unable to generate grassroots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement.“I’m the guy that told him, ‘You shouldn’t accept any money from a Super PAC, because people can’t possibly trust you,’ ” Biden said in a 2018 interview with “PBS NewsHour.” “How will a middle-class guy accept [you] if you accept money?”

AD

The Sanders campaign rejected the idea that Biden had anything to do with its campaign finance decisions.“In reality, Joe is the guy who sat there and observed a candidate named Bernie Sanders consistently — over the course of a lifetime — reject corporate money to build one grassroots campaign after another.Let’s start with the primary, where the whole reason Biden is contemplating reversing his position on super PACs is that his fundraising trails that of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom not only don’t want outside help but refuse to even do fundraising events for high-dollar donors.Sanders and Warren are succeeding in raising all that grass-roots cash because they have a wide base of enthusiastic supporters.“If the deficit is helping to support demand, and that support is keeping us moving forward, then I see no reason to complain about the fact that the deficit has increased,” said Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University who has served as an adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).But her task would be easier if she backed a less sweeping approach than the Medicare-for-all legislation written by her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Passing the Sanders legislation — which would provide every American with a comprehensive set of benefits, largely without any co-pays — could expand the government’s financial obligations more than 50 percent over the next 10 years.Sanders has admitted more freely that taxes would go up — but he has argued that overall health-care costs would decrease for most people because they would no longer have to pay for private coverage.From Post political reporter Dave Weigel:

Clinton’s approach to Sanders was both 1) to draw out how expensive it would be, and 2) to say it could never pass.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), left, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)The senator, a leading candidate for the 2020 nod, is endearing herself to liberals by backing the Sanders bill, but there’s a wide range of ways to get the country to universal health coverage — nearly all of them less expensive than Medicare-for-all.This approach is closest to what Sanders has proposed in Medicare-for-all.“Black patients incurred about $1,800 less in medical costs per year than white patients with the same number of chronic conditions; thus the algorithm scored white patients as equally at risk of future health problems as black patients who had many more diseases.”

— Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released a plan to legalize marijuana nationwide and expunge criminal convictions related to marijuana.Under the plan, Sanders would wield executive power to reclassify marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance and would call on Congress to pass legislation to permanently legalize the drug.Our Post colleague Sean Sullivan writes that the proposals from Sanders and other 2020 presidential contenders are a “shift from past presidential elections when Democrats, like Republicans, often promoted more toughness.After taking two weeks away from the trail to recover, Sanders has resumed his busy schedule with a four-day swing through three states, concluding Sunday in Michigan.“This is who I am as a human being, and it ain’t gonna change.”

AD

Sanders’s aides played down the notion that his words amount to a concerted new strategy, saying they have personally heard him say similar things in the past.It is unclear whether Sanders will continue addressing his age so frankly.Biden, 76, and Warren, 70, have also faced questions about their age, but the subject is showing signs of becoming a larger concern for Sanders, especially since his heart attack.AD

AD

Forty-three percent of Democrats in early battleground states said Sanders was too old to serve effectively as president, according to an October CBS News/YouGov poll, up from 37 percent in September.Sanders is not the first presidential candidate forced to deflect questions about his age.Reagan joked that “I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.”

AD

Even before Sanders’s heart attack, a core part of his strategy was to emphasize that he is the candidate who could be most trusted to deliver a sweeping liberal agenda.AD

Now Sanders is using the heightened focus on his age to underline that pitch.“I do not go around this country disparaging other Democratic candidates,” Sanders said Thursday.But he added, “What distinguishes my candidacy from the others is I have been fighting for the working families of this country for many, many decades.”

AD

During his current swing through Iowa, Sanders has also spoken directly, if briefly, about his heart attack.“I learned more about cardiology in the last couple weeks than I knew much about in my life,” Sanders responded.“It turns out about a million people per year have the procedure that you and I had.”

Still, Sanders has yet to provide details about how much damage his heart sustained.AD

Sanders’s allies are also hopeful that recent high-profile endorsements from a pair of young, liberal congresswomen will infuse his campaign with a more youthful image.Sanders plans to hold a rally with another potential endorser, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), in Detroit on Sunday and a similar event with Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in Minneapolis early next month.Omar endorsed Sanders last week; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was the other to do so.“Wisdom comes with age — you don’t start out that smart,” said Raymond Langloss, 57, who wore a “Bernie beats Trump” button to the Marshalltown town hall.The bigger question for Sanders is whether he can win undecided voters such as Mary Stevens, 70, who said she is choosing among six Democratic candidates.He obviously is in good shape.”

Even before his heart attack, Sanders often answered questions about his age by saying it was only one of many factors voters should consider.“This is not a beauty contest,” Sanders said, adding jokingly, “which obviously I would win.”

Politics Bernie Sanders offers marijuana legalization plan The new proposal highlights how much Democrats, and many Republicans, have shifted on drug penalties.His campaign advisers were aggressively opposed to the idea as recently as three weeks ago, pushing back against a Washington Post report stating that the campaign ‘has publicly discouraged’ outside help because they felt it was not worded strongly enough.”

-- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released a marijuana legalization plan to expunge criminal convictions related to the drug.Sean Sullivan reports: “Sanders’s plan, which aims to overhaul an approach he argues has unfairly hurt minorities, calls for using executive power to reclassify marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance and passing legislation to permanently legalize the drug.Sanders, who is running on a platform of curtailing income inequality and reining in the power of big companies, says he would create provisions to prevent large corporations from dominating the market.”

-- And then there were 17: Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) quit the presidential race and said he will run for reelection to the House.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said the nation should “leave fossil fuels in the ground.” He has vowed to end drilling on land.In a campaign document released in August titled “The Green New Deal,” Sanders said his administration would not grant new offshore leasing permits to oil companies and he would require companies operating offshore to fix oil and greenhouse gas leaks in pipelines and other infrastructure.“I’m the guy that told him, ‘You shouldn’t accept any money from a Super PAC, because people can’t possibly trust you,’ ” Biden said in a 2018 interview with “PBS NewsHour.” “How will a middle-class guy accept [you] if you accept money?”

Biden claimed credit last year for advising 2016 candidate Bernie Sanders not to accept outside money.I will be controlled by the working people of this country,” Sanders told reporters in response to the news.“We deserve someone who writes the damn bills,” said Tlaib, referencing Sanders’s blunt reminder at a debate that he wrote sweeping Medicare-for-all legislation.“We deserve Bernie Sanders.”

AD

The crowd inside a high school gymnasium here in Detroit erupted in cheers.Sanders joined Tlaib onstage, where the two hugged.AD

Sanders praised Tlaib for “standing up to the vulgarity and ugliness of Donald Trump” and taking on “the greed and corruption of the economic establishment.”

“I will look to her for her leadership in Congress under a Sanders administration,” he added.The endorsement, which has been widely anticipated, came less than two weeks after Sanders won the backing of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), two other members of the Squad.Allies of Sanders hope the support from these young and prominent women of color, all elected to Congress in 2018, will give his campaign a fresher and more youthful feel at a moment when his age and health have come under scrutiny.Sanders suffered a heart attack on Oct. 1, a point he referred to in an aside toward the end of his speech on Sunday.And by the way, my heart is doing just fine,” said Sanders, who at age 78 is the oldest candidate in the field.AD

AD

Sanders is also looking for ways to build more support for his campaign, which has trailed two others for months.It's unclear whether the endorsements from members of the Squad, whose liberal ideologies are very similar to Sanders’s, will ultimately help him accomplish that.Like Sanders, she identifies as a democratic socialist.Sanders and Tlaib each pledged $5,000 from their campaigns to support the school’s marching band.Sanders struggled to win the support of African American voters when he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016.More than 4,700 people attended Sunday’s rally, according to an estimate provided by the Sanders campaign.AD

The Sanders campaign allowed a small group of reporters to cover the tour of Tlaib’s district they took beforehand.He told them that while he does not consider himself a politically affiliated person, he trusts Sanders.Tlaib referenced his attack on Sunday, saying, “Well, Mr. President, I am home.”

Sunday’s rally concluded a four-day, three-state swing for Sanders, his first extended campaign trip since his heart attack.On an “End Corporate Greed Tour” through Iowa on Thursday and Friday, Sanders started repeatedly framing his advanced age as an asset that he said reflects his lengthy and unrivaled record of liberal activism.“There are advantages to being old,” Sanders said, pointing out his decades of liberal activism.“Bernie has the life experience to have seen the hollowing out of rural towns,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign who recently stumped for the senator in Iowa.“It’s why people believe him when he says he will fight to revitalize these communities and bring back good-paying jobs.”

Sanders will return to Iowa on Friday and Saturday.That plan was temporarily upset by Bernie Sanders, but Hillary Clinton’s early coronation did nothing to allay Democratic fears; they simply decided to worry about that instead, that they had decided too early on a candidate who had too much baggage to win the general election (in that case, the fears weren’t misplaced).The comments, at a conference in Washington hosted by the liberal Jewish organization J Street, were Sanders’s most direct attempt yet to fuse his heritage to his political approach and policy agenda.Sanders is the only prominent Jewish candidate, a vocal critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch Palestinian defender and the preferred candidate of the nation’s first two Muslim congresswomen.AD

Sanders was one of 10 Democratic White House hopefuls who made appearances or sent videos for the three-day summit that concluded Monday.AD

Some of the disagreements about the future of relations with Israel and Palestinian territories were evident at the convention, where some candidates advocated a more cautious approach than Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg.And Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) advocated for applying pressure on Israel several ways, rather than settling on one that “is going to become a partisan litmus test.”

But it was remarks by Sanders, who has long been reluctant to talk about himself, that stood out most.AD

Drawing on his Jewish heritage and visits to the region — “As a kid, I spent many months on a kibbutz in Israel,” he told the crowd — Sanders sought to emphasize that is he not choosing Palestinian rights over Israeli rights, even as he has been highly critical of Netanyahu’s practices.AD

“I believe absolutely not only in the right of Israel to exist but the right to exist in peace and security,” Sanders said.“But what I also believe is the Palestinian people have a right to live in security and peace, as well.”

Sanders said U.S. aid should be contingent on Israel’s conduct in the region, saying the United States should not give “carte blanche to the Israeli government.”

AD

Later, Sanders was asked how he would weather attacks from Republicans alleging Democrats are weak on Israel or, worse, anti-Semitic.“Being Jewish may be helpful in that regard,” Sanders said.“It’s going to be very hard for anybody to call me, whose father’s family was wiped out by Hitler, who spent time in Israel, an anti-Semite.”

Sanders recently won an endorsement from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), whose comments about Israel have stoked controversy and drawn criticism from both political parties.AD

AD

Omar plans to hold a rally with Sanders in Minneapolis next weekend.On Sunday, Sanders held a rally with Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the first Palestinian American woman sworn into Congress.In his remarks Monday, Sanders argued that “it is not anti-Semitism to say that the Netanyahu government has been racist.” He added, “That’s a fact.”THE PROGNOSIS

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is intensifying his calls to legalize marijuana products.But Sanders, who has long supported legalizing marijuana, is leaning into the issue on the campaign trail.“Sanders’s plan, which aims to overhaul an approach he argues has unfairly hurt minorities, calls for using executive power to reclassify marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance and passing legislation to permanently legalize the drug,” Sean writes.), who are polling ahead of Sanders, have also proposed sweeping changes to the country’s marijuana laws.A similar gap exists among the overall electorate, but that’s not a concern for Sanders, who has long been the party’s loudest and most candid voice on Medicare for All.AD

What was a statement of progressive bona fides and a means of preventing Sanders from getting to her left may now be an anvil around her neck, creating a policy problem she cannot credibly solve with no apparent political payoff.and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).or Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), his two main rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, in trying to wean Americans from the use of fossil fuels.He plans to vote in the Democratic primary now: "The Democratic Party is at a crossroads, where it has to choose either a center-left candidate ([Joe] Biden, [Pete] Buttigieg, [Amy] Klobuchar, [Andrew] Yang) or a far-left populist ([Elizabeth] Warren, [Bernie] Sanders) as their nominee for president.She wasn’t the only Democratic presidential candidate to call for an end to federal funding for new charter schools; Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) did the same thing.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) called for a moratorium on the same program in his education platform, eliciting the same outrage from many of the same players.But it dovetails with the broader trend of candidates more frequently calling out individual companies as liberal Democrats such as Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) run 2020 campaigns challenging corporate size and income.Had Sanders or Hillary Clinton not floated your boat, you could have selected Henry Hewes, Lloyd Kelso or the inimitable Vermin Supreme.But the primaries are still more open than they ever have been, not only to candidates who aren’t white men but also to those such as Sanders who have little support from the party and push against its ideological boundaries.Sanders may never get to be president, but he has shown that it’s possible to build a contending campaign outside the structures that usually validate candidates for voters.“I’ve just been blown away that this guy took not just five minutes, but 45 minutes, with, like, a Republican from Alabama.”

AHH: Friends and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) want the presidential contender to slow down after his heart attack and suggest he should speak openly about the experience when he does return to campaigning, our Post colleagues Sean Sullivan and Chelsea Janes report.“The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders’s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can — or should — maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign,” they write.Sanders spent Monday recovering at his home in Burlington, Vt.The campaign did not initially disclose that Sanders had a heart attack, saying at first that Sanders had two stents inserted in an artery after chest pains.Rep.

We absolutely will - we are proud Democrats.The corporate wing of the Democratic Party is publicly "anybody but Bernie."Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)didn’t explicitly embrace a price on carbon, with Sanders’s camp arguing that the urgency of acting on climate change might make this possibly incremental step too slow.Still others (such as Sanders) want to phase nuclear power out.Two, Sanders and Yang, argue that all pipelines should be blocked.Sanders, who proposes the most spending, also has the most significant projected job-creation effects.Here’s some unsolicited advice for all from someone — that would be me — who likes both Sanders and Warren: Stop this argument, now.Sanders calls for a “political revolution,” while Warren refers to herself as a “capitalist.” Sanders possesses a talent for pitching transformative policy in a simple way.As for Sanders, it’s easy to take swings at Medicare-for-all but it’s impossible to deny the phrase has entered the vernacular and shifted the health-care debate, much the way the issue of income and wealth inequality achieved new visibility with Occupy Wall Street’s division of the population into the 99 percent and 1 percent.Well, on one hand, no small number of people in the Democratic Party sphere do not want to concede Sanders’s political talent.While many appear to lazily assume the current Warren and Sanders supporters are interchangeable, that’s just not so.Sanders’s base is younger, less educated and earns less money.In other words, is not a given that Sanders and Warren voters will magically accrue to the other if one or the other drops out now.Both Warren and Sanders appear capable of leading a movement for change.Eight of the Democratic candidates initially accepted CNN's invitation to discuss this critically important issue: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and businessman Andrew Yang.and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Sanders’s plan targets 100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transportation by 2030, with complete decarbonization by 2050.Sanders’s plan states it would not extend licenses for nuclear plants.Sanders has committed to banning fracking altogether.Sanders has promised to commit $780 billion to research and development, although to a narrower set of sectors and as a lower proportion of spending in his overall $16 trillion plan.The Sanders plan discusses natural ways to remove carbon from the air, but scientists are concerned about how stable these forms of carbon storage would be given that climate change is already weakening forests’ ability to store carbon.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who rolled out his own GND last week, referred back to that; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) noted that she was “a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal,” referring to the Senate version of the plan; former congressman Beto O'Rourke said only that he “love[d] the framing of the Green New Deal.” Rather than a plan for the next Democratic president to move on quickly, the Green New Deal as proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) et.POLL WATCH

The state's most respected pollster had been asking a friendly, open-ended question of Democratic voters.In April, that question put Bernie Sanders narrowly ahead of the field.This is also the umpteenth poll to find Sanders lagging behind as a second choice; Warren is the runner-up for 20 percent of Democrats, compared with 18 percent for Biden, 13 percent for Sanders, and 11 percent for Kamala Harris.In the 2016 primary against Hillary Clinton, Sanders did worst in Milwaukee, where her support with black voters was unshakable.But in the suburbs, in Madison and in northeast Wisconsin, Warren runs ahead of Sanders; in rural areas, Biden and Sanders again run ahead of her.He released a plan to fight worker displacement from automation with a Federal Automation and Worker Protection and an accompanying “robot tax.”

Bernie Sanders.(Warren and Sanders might also argue that their populism equips them to keep Trump’s margins lower among working-class whites, too.)Ms. Klobuchar similarly emphasized the waste problem and said she would not support new plants “unless we can find safe storage.”

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont unequivocally opposed nuclear energy, rejecting a questioner’s premise that it was irresponsible, in the face of such an urgent crisis, to take a carbon-free option off the table.Enter Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who, at a climate-change forum on Wednesday, brought up the so-called Mexico City agreement, a policy position (effective through executive order) that bans aid from the United States going to abortion providers, even if the money isn’t used for abortions.So why did Sanders bring this up at a climate-change forum?Again Sanders blundered on:

AD

AD

And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that are — that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control, to me is totally absurd.However, Sanders’s formulation smacks of population control by limiting nonwhite births.The antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony List pounced, sending out missives accusing Sanders of preaching a “repugnant ‘solution’ to climate change — eliminating the children of poorer nations through abortion, paid for by American tax dollars.” At a time when progressives have the high ground in abortion politics, citing the cruel and unreasonable abortion bans, Sanders’s remark is, to put it lightly, unhelpful.As with Sanders, all the issue did was put the target on Democrats’ backs in the battle to determine who gets cast as the most unreasonable side in the abortion fight.Perhaps Sanders is not sharp enough to avoid substantive mistakes that paint his party’s views in a bad light.Sanders has already teed up the “socialist” issue for Republicans by embracing the term.Sanders’s comments drew almost instant denunciations on the right.The Republican National Committee accused Sanders of saying he wanted to “abort poor babies for population control.” Conservative CNN host S.E.Cupp accused Sanders of supporting “EUGENICS.” Fox News’s headline alleged that Sanders said “he’d back US funding for Third World abortions.”

AD

We can say three things:

Many of these critiques distort what Sanders actually said.The policy Sanders said he would reverse is something each of the past two Democratic presidents have reversed, so his position on it is hardly a surprise.And … Sanders talked about the issue in a way Democrats haven’t generally talked about it, which should raise some eyebrows.Sanders seems to think it should be.Plus, as reaction to Sanders’s response showed, abortion foes see an inherent link between population-control efforts and an uptick in abortions.But Sanders is hardly the first Democrat to attach the issue to environmental concerns.AD

Sanders’s 2016 campaign said he opposes that 1974 law, known as the Helms amendment.AD

Sanders did invoke abortion in his answer, but only in accurately describing what the Mexico City policy does.But when describing specifically how he would support combating global population growth, Sanders only mentioned birth control.Sanders’s answer certainly invites more debate on how much of a priority this is for the Democratic Party — and what specifically should be done about it.This post has been updated to clarify Sanders’s position on the Helms amendment.Putting aside the entertainment factor, here are three short takeaways from a long evening:

We need to talk about the hard stuff

Some people undoubtedly went to bed mad that Sanders said we need to control human population growth.AD

Sen. Bernie Sanders’s voters eat up his “capitalism is theft” sort of message and think the profit motive is at the source of problems such as health-care insurance.For Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is spending gobs of time in South Carolina and assiduously courting Biden’s middle-aged church lady, the key will be siphoning off Biden voters and picking off voters queasy about Sanders or Warren but who think Biden is just “blah.” She perhaps stands to gain the most if Biden falters.I’m not sure who the typical Castro voter is, or how Beto O’Rourke’s appeal can win over Biden, Warren or Sanders voters.Pushed by Inslee and other progressives in the field, including Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the 10 participants each staked out positions far to the left of what even the Obama administration sought on climate change.Sanders defended the size of his $16.3 trillion climate plan, as well as his opposition to keeping nuclear power plants open — even though they produce more than half of the nation's carbon-free electricity, citing the risk of disasters such as meltdowns and the difficulty of storing nuclear waste.The poll also shows another Democratic White House hopeful, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), with a slight lead over the Republican president, 48 percent to 44 percent.During Joe Biden’s turn onstage, in prime time, a Bernie bro popped the former vice president for planning to attend a fundraiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, the co-founder of a natural-gas company ( as reported by the Intercept’s Akela Lacy ).“There will be a transition,” said Sanders, acknowledging that personal sacrifice will be required to meet the challenge.Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.Bernie Sanders — 4.Read more on 2020:

Sanders also made case that he can win.“We are beating Donald Trump in every poll that’s ever been done,” Sanders said to supporters gathered to see him at a bar across the street from the convention center.Once again the front-runner, she nearly lost Iowa to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and in New Hampshire eight days later was trounced by Sanders, whose neighborly Vermont connections and support among independent voters carried him to victory.Clinton recouped in South Carolina on the strength of the black vote but could never quite shake Sanders.The bitterness among Sanders’s supporters persisted throughout the general election and lingers to this day.Sanders, Amy Klobuchar and Bill de Blasio have each said d--- (rhymes with ham) in a debate.And Sanders in 2015 offered a "bulls---" at one point.“Some of Bernie Sanders’ fiercest supporters are sounding the alarm that the campaign is bogged down by disorganization, personality clashes, and poor communication between state operations and national headquarters."Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) promises a Democratic-socialist revolution that puts government in charge of huge sectors of the economy.In his Iowa ad, which features an image of Buttigieg during his 2014 tour of duty in Afghanistan with the Navy Reserve, he presents himself as a calm, fresh-faced outsider from Washington offering “real solutions, not more polarization.”

He has echoed that message on the trail in recent weeks, refining his vague “Win the Era” slogan to an argument meant to more firmly position him as a next-generation change agent, with center-left policy views like Biden and an urgency to shake up the system more reminiscent of Warren and Sanders, the liberal disrupters in the race.“If we really want to win, we have to present a different kind of message.”

With the exception of Warren and Sanders, who are competitive with Biden in New Hampshire, most of the Democratic field is waiting for Biden's voters to migrate away from him and discover their options.“We have to win the presidency, yes, but to do the big things that we need to do when it comes to climate and health care and gun safety, we also need to win the Senate.”

On Saturday, Warren and Sanders sometimes appeared to be running in a different primary altogether.After the convention, Sanders greeted supporters at a rally, where chants of “Bernie beats Trump” broke out and where the candidate cited polls to volunteers who were about to knock on skeptical voters' doors.“We are beating Donald Trump in every poll that’s ever been done,” Sanders said.The debates have revealed that most of the backlash to 2016 came from supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); with his position secure, the anger at party rules has been minimal.Joe Biden — 24%

Another week, another big delta between Democratic voters' personal preference and their expectation of who other people might vote for.Since the network's last survey in July, Biden's organization has caught up, in sheer staff numbers, with Warren and Sanders; Biden has also beaten the other two candidates to TV, though every candidate is starting the air war later than in previous cycles.While 46 percent of voters say they would be enthused to see Warren lead the ticket, and 38 percent say that for Sanders, just 28 percent say it of Biden.Bernie Sanders.(Sanders spent the run-up to the 2018 midterm election rallying with Hickenlooper's successor, Gov.And there's no reason to own assault weapons.”

Buttigieg, meanwhile, had riled the antiabortion movement with an interview on the Breakfast Club; in a wide-ranging discussion about abortion, he said that Republicans “hold everybody in line with this one piece of doctrine about abortion,” but “there’s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath, and so even that is something that we can interpret differently.” Buttigieg didn't say that was his position, but even his brother-in-law had condemned the comments, and the discussion came days after antiabortion activists accused Sen. Bernie Sanders of favoring “population control” by arguing for the restoration of family planning funds in international aid.I’ve lived my dream job, I’ve been a special needs teacher.”

The group, the largest in the House Democratic caucus, is made up of nearly 100 House members and one senator, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).John Fetterman, who endorsed Sanders for president in 2016 and won the senator from Vermont's support for his own 2018 run.While Sanders ran on a fracking ban in 2016, the Democratic National Committee voted narrowly not to endorse the ban.In 2018, when Sanders campaigned in Colorado, he avoided talking about a ballot measure that would have drastically limited the area where natural gas companies could explore; the statewide Democratic ticket did not support it.Since then, a total and immediate ban on fracking, short for hydraulic fracturing, has reappeared in Sanders's comprehensive climate plan.I think you can push as hard as possible to make the transition as fast as possible.”

The difficulty of running against fracking crept up Monday, too, when Sanders campaigned in Colorado.Josh Fox, the director of the documentary “Gasland,” essentially kicked off the campaign to ban fracking; as a surrogate for Sanders, in 2016 and now, he has argued that the “nuanced” position ends up only losing liberal votes.“Hillary [Clinton] lost Pennsylvania because of fracking,” Fox said in an interview after a Sanders rally in New Hampshire.He pointed to the landslide Texas defeat of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary as proof that a liberal like Warren had no local pull.When Sen. Bernie Sanders rallied in Louisville recently, Beshear wasn't there — but Republican Gov.Matt Bevin cut a video that portrayed Beshear as a Sanders ally.Sanders appears again at the top of the Republican Governors Association's latest volley here (Putting Kentucky First is its state advertising vehicle), which warns that “Washington liberals want to eliminate employer-provided health coverage” and that Beshear supports “taxpayer funded health-care benefits to people who can work but choose not to.” The first part doesn't describe Beshear, an opponent of Medicare-for-all; the second part is a reference to Bevin's struggle to add work requirements to Medicaid, which when implemented in other states has removed beneficiaries from the rolls.Just 69 percent of likely primary voters say they view Warren favorably, relatively low for an incumbent, but Warren long has faced skepticism that she could win the primary or the general election; a Boston Globe editorial in December 2018 urged her not to run, warning that she would be too “divisive.”

Pete Buttigieg emerged on Tuesday night as the marquee candidate of the centrist Democratic party, and he did so by emulating a political move from an unlikely model: Bernie Sanders.A great fun fact about Pete Buttigieg is that he once won a “Profiles in Courage” essay contest in high school with a piece celebrating his political hero: Sanders.Sanders began 2016 as a protest candidate, only partway through realizing that he could actually, truly win the whole shebang.He’s running as an Indiana pragmatist, not the heir to Sanders’s legacy his teenage self would’ve been excited about.Mike DeBonis

Bernie Sanders Went to Canada, and a Dream of ‘Medicare for All’ Flourished The Vermont senator has staked his presidential campaign, and much of his political legacy, on transforming health care in America.Not surprisingly, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who put forth the boldest plan, has drawn the most fire.Sanders’s blueprint — which calls for spending $16 trillion over a decade to meet its goals, including moving to 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 — is dismissed by many as too radical, too costly, too ambitious and too politically dangerous.MSNBC analyst Jonathan Alter described Sanders’s plan as “pie-in-the-sky.” Christy Goldfuss, who worked on climate issues in the Obama administration, told The Post, “If Americans are scared that this is going to negatively impact their economy, they will not be supportive of the most ambitious climate plan and they won’t be supportive of the Democratic nominee.” Paul Starr, a liberal Princeton sociologist and co-founder of the American Prospect magazine, scorned the Sanders plan to CNN: “This is not what the country needs or is likely to support.The Sanders proposal won’t do that.”

No question Sanders’s plan is staggering in size and scope.As environmentalist Bill McKibben notes, Sanders’s plan actually tackles what is demanded by the threat.South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former housing secretary Julián Castro, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and businessman Andrew Yang have also said they support voluntary buybacks.He noted that sectoral bargaining, which would allow workers to negotiate as a unit rather than on a company-by-company basis, was advocated by Sanders in his labor plan.Trump’s nine-point deficit against Sen. Bernie Sanders (52-43) is tied for his second-highest in high-quality national polls.Sanders (Vt.) is popular, but he also avoided many attacks in his 2016 campaign against Clinton, and his brand of democratic socialism could be a harder sell once people become familiar with it.And the ABC-Washington Post poll finds Americans preferring the top Democratic candidates (Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris) to Trump by double-digit margins.… Uber and Lyft are pushing for an alternative to AB5, and together with Doordash say they will spend a combined $90 million on a 2020 ballot initiative on gig work…”

The Biden camapign has repeatedly refused to take a position, but Warren, Sanders, Harris, Buttigieg and Julian Castro have all endorsed the bill.Felicia Sonmez reports: “The group, the largest in the House Democratic caucus, is made up of nearly 100 House members and one senator, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Sanders runs ahead of Trump by nine points among registered voters and 12 points among all adults.Sanders has a net positive rating of 12 points (51 percent favorable, 39 percent unfavorable).Among women, the president is trailing by significant margins — by 30 points against Biden and by over 20 points against Sanders, Harris and Warren.Medicare for All first became a fixture in the national political conversation in 2016, when Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) presented his plan for universal medical insurance during his Democratic presidential campaign.Since then, the idea has only gained traction in the political sphere, with several Democratic frontrunners for the 2020 presidential election announcing their support for Sanders’ plan.Wharton Professor Mark V.

Sanders Releases Pharma Pricing Plan, Housing Shortage Continues Senator Bernie Sanders has released a plan meant to limit over-priced drugs.From Trump who calls the deal “a bad, bad deal for American businesses, for workers, for taxpayers,” to Sanders who recommends “[killing] this unfettered free-trade agreement which would cost us nearly half a million jobs,” all of the democratic nominees and the presumptive Republican nominees have had a critical view of this trade agreement.As Presidential candidates like Trump and Sanders bash the NAFTA agreement, citing trade policies the reason Americans are losing manufacturing jobs, there is another side to the story.This is fundamentally about freedom and openness, and also expresses my belief in the power of people-to-people engagement…I believe that American businesses should not be put at a disadvantage, and that increased commerce is good for Americans and for Cubans.”[1]

There’s also the nagging problem that Sanders’s ideas are unpopular with voters outside his cultish clique.A July Post/ABC News poll found Trump ahead by six points against “a Democratic candidate who you regard as a socialist.” Sanders won’t just be perceived to be a socialist; he’ll proudly tell you he is one.Sanders is unlikely to become the nominee unless he can quell the sense among many Democrats that he’s just not one of them.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is 78, has not yet fully committed to releasing his.Also noteworthy, Biden earned a new voter bloc among the incarcerated population when he said, “Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime.”

In sum: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was very Bernie.The Sanders campaign says it is closing in on 1 million donors and hauled in more than 13,000 contributions on a single day last week.Warren and Sanders had big second quarters, bringing in about $19 million and $18 million, respectively.AD

Sanders campaign officials voiced optimism about their fundraising pace, which relies largely on an extensive email list and a loyal network of supporters who frequently donate in small increments.Sanders also has held a handful of what his campaign calls “grass-roots fundraisers” with modest entrance fees.“The advantage of relying on grass-roots fundraisers is we can be in a gym in Iowa eating pizza with real people and talking about the issues that matter to them, as opposed to sipping Prosecco and eating canapés in a penthouse,” said Ari Rabin-Havt, deputy campaign manager for Sanders.and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — did well enough.So congratulations to Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.Bernie Sanders — 4.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was vaguest of all, promising to slash military spending, while making “it clear” that “we as a planet, as a global community, will work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism.”

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has actual military experience in Afghanistan but nevertheless offered no particular reason for his claim that securing Afghanistan does not “require an open-ended commitment of ground troops.” What if ground troops are the best, or only, way to keep a pro-Western government in Kabul, and if keeping such a government stable is the best, or only, way to prevent a terrorist resurgence?and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are also in their seventies.I view it differently from Senators Sanders and Warren who think we can throw the switch on this big part of the American economy."You can ask Senator Warren that...all I can focus on is my campaign," Bernie Sanders tells @ABC when asked why Elizabeth Warren's supporters should back him.10:29 p.m.: Warren, Sanders and Harris show resiliency through their personal backgrounds

Muir then asked Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders what he made of concerns that a rapid withdrawal from Afghanistan could turn the country back into a militant safe haven.Sanders cited his own record voting against the war in Iraq and against Trump’s military budgets.One possibility is the insurgent campaigns of Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left.On the Democratic side, the progressive movement represented by Sanders led some Democrats away from their usual group-based way of thinking and more toward ideological and policy concerns.Far more than most Democratic presidential contenders, Sanders openly discussed ideological concepts, proudly promoting progressivism and democratic socialism.Biden, flanked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., began the debate by going on offense against the two liberal candidates, casting their universal health-care program as unworkable, too expensive and a betrayal of President Barack Obama's signature achievement.He called Sanders a "socialist," and questioned the amount of time it would take to pass his more far-reaching plan.Sanders, whose voice was hoarse, also said that families are looking for "effective" health care."I don't think it's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea," Sen.

Sanders knocked the often-hefty monthly health insurance premiums currently paid by most Americans, which he wouldn’t include in Medicare-for-all.ABC moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Warren several times to clarify whether private insurance would be eliminated under Sanders’s Medicare-for-all plan – and whether taxes would have to increase for middle-class families.“I know that the senator says she’s for Bernie,” Biden said at the debate’s outset, referring to Warren.“They renewed demands for gun-control measures such as bans on assault rifles.”

REMINDER: O'Rourke's plan is certainly pretty radical — at least compared to the current status quo — and risky politically.This time around, Mr. Sanders shares an ideological lane with Ms. Warren on the leftward flank of the crowded Democratic primary, and the pair have been battling for second place in public polling behind former Vice President Joe Biden in recent weeks.Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, said in a statement: "We look forward to working with the Working Families Party and other allies to defeat Donald Trump.More than 80% listed Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders as their top two picks.Sen.

“So how are you going to pay off?” Sanders asked.“I’m going to kill myself.”

“Hold it, John,” Sanders said firmly.Since the town hall, Sanders has tweeted several times about Weigel, holding him up as an example of a broken health-care system.My question is: why aren’t they angry about it?” Sanders wrote on Twitter Friday night.This is why we fight for Medicare for All.”

Reached at his home Saturday afternoon, Weigel said he spoke to Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, after the event and they told him they would help, though they didn’t say how.Later Saturday, the Sanders campaign said it had “already reached out to a Nevada senate office for case work help.”

Weigel, a Sanders supporter, said he appreciated that the candidate “didn’t blow me off” like so many others had in his life.What Weigel didn’t share with Sanders is that he’s also had to pay for his anti-depressants and heart medications out of pocket, one month forgoing them because it was getting too expensive.The other candidate in the top tier, Sen.

Sanders — author of the first Medicare-for-all bill — relies more heavily on longtime Senate staff than outside advisers, according to those in Democratic circles.As an independent who embraces the term “socialist,” Sanders has long forged his own pathway on health-care policy and is less likely to draw from mainstream Democratic ideas to inform his views.Lori Kearns, who has worked for Sanders since 2012, served as Sanders’s health policy adviser as his office was writing Medicare-for-all back in 2015.Other Senate staff who have worked for Sanders on health policy in the Senate include Marissa Barrera, who has been a health policy analyst since 2016 for the Budget Committee, where Sanders serves as the ranking Democrat.He has worked for Sanders for two decades.“The lead plaintiffs’ lawyers said in a statement they ‘remain confident the judiciary will swiftly respond to yet another attempt by the opioid defendants to delay the trial.’ ”

Weigel told Colby that he was told by his Tricare health insurance, which he signed up for after retiring from the military, that the coverage was canceled because he hadn’t re-enrolled, despite having his coverage automatically renewed in past years.“Since the town hall, Sanders has tweeted several times about Weigel, holding him up as an example of a broken health-care system,” Colby writes:

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and billionaire activist Tom Steyer also fielded questions here.Sanders told the audience he came from a “working class family who lived paycheck to paycheck.”

In his turn onstage, Sanders also took aim at opponents such as Biden who voted for the Iraq War and sweeping trade deals.In 2015, the WFP endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, after 87 percent of its members asked it to, leading Sanders to praise it as “the closest thing there is to a political party that believes in my vision of democratic socialism.” And it was a happy marriage, boosting Sanders in the primary while bringing more energy and attention to the growing WFP.(Sanders is an independent who caucuses with Democrats.)But supporters of Sanders began to focus on the opaque way party leaders and party members' votes were calculated.Videos of Mitchell's appearance on CNN were deluged with angry comments from Sanders supporters, comparing a clip of him praising Warren for policies supported by both him and Sanders to a “hostage video.” The socialist magazine Jacobin wrote that the WFP, by not supporting Sanders, had talked itself into political impotence.“The Sanders base isn’t going away, whatever the election results next year,” Jacobin editors Bhaskar Sunkara and Micah Uetricht argued.Second, Warren allies, like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, repeatedly urged members to look for the WFP ballot — it cost nothing to sign up to vote — while Sanders allies did less.And third, while the Sanders campaign tapped Analilia Mejia to be its national political director this year, her ties to the New Jersey branch of the WFP — she used to run it — did not move votes.But as of Tuesday afternoon, the Sanders campaign was asking the WFP to explain its vote.“We respect the result of the WFP’s endorsement process, but we do believe they should release the final tally of both the board vote and the member vote, as they did in 2015,” said Sanders communications adviser Mike Casca.If there's a reason to be skeptical of the crosstabs, it's that just 4 percent of Jewish voters support Bernie Sanders, the most electorally successful Jewish politician in American history.Bernie Sanders.He'll build a “Bernie beats Trump” campaign tour around the weekend's steak fry in Des Moines.Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).This is probably why even Sanders has acknowledged that his ban wouldn’t take effect “overnight.”

A phaseout, or a ban only on new fracking, might wreak less economic havoc, but it would still set back efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.In addition, Working Families Party, a pro-union progressive group, which backed Sanders in 2016, endorsed Warren.Sanders supporters responded by grousing that “national committee leaders — 56 people — held 50 percent of the voting power, with party members accounting for the other 50 percent,” as the New York Times put it.Sanders also has overhauled his New Hampshire operation.By vacuuming up all those voters, she may well pass Sanders (and has in some polls).“Among black voters, [Warren] still trails Biden by 31 points and Sanders by 11 points.” The Biden who spoke at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., on Sunday holds the support (for now) of African American voters; the Biden in the debates doesn’t seem to register.AD

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).The endorsement, first reported by the New York Times, is yet another sign of Warren's ascendancy over Sanders.Considering Sanders in 2016 called the group “the closest thing there is to a political party that believes in my vision of democratic socialism,” the switch-over could make a big impact on the base.Moving on: “We were tremendously proud to endorse Sanders in 2016 and a critical section of our base voted for him, and we have nothing but positive things to say about him and his activists,” Mitchell told us, declining to criticize Sanders several times.Sanders's campaign manager tamped down the drama: “We look forward to working with the Working Families Party and other allies to defeat Donald Trump.But there's this from Sanders's Iowa state director:

Sanders performed well in Iowa against Hillary Clinton in 2016, fighting her to a near-draw in the Democratic caucuses.Before joining Sanders, Mazour served for six years as the lead organizer on the farm and environment team at Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement.Caiazzo will now head up the Sanders campaign operation in his home state of Massachusetts.Sanders’s response is that if insurance was no longer the responsibility of the employer, they could return what they’re paying now back to workers in the form of wages.The strike has drawn support from Democratic presidential candidates such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)(Sanders is getting some of that now.)Sanders’s plan posits a number of funding sources and specifies a premium for families (“a typical family of four earning $50,000, after taking the standard deduction, would pay a 4 percent income-based premium to fund Medicare for All — just $844 a year — saving that family over $4,400 a year.Now, there are a lot of people who consider themselves middle-class who might have to pay more, but at least Sanders makes some effort to spell out the costs and the savings.Biden, Sanders, and Warren are all in their way formidable contenders who bring lots of assets and political skills to the table.A September 18 Survey USA poll confirmed that Biden does best, followed by Sanders followed by Warren, followed by Harris.But then it’s hard to understand why Sanders would be in second.The fact that she’s three years younger than Trump should stop this from being a general election liability, and the fact that she’s younger than either Sanders or Biden will definitely keep it from being a primary election liability.Sanders is not formally a member of the Democratic Party and has chosen to identify himself as a democratic socialist.But Biden’s strong standing in the polls, the fact that Warren and Sanders combined have only about a third of the estimated vote, and the extent to which a healthy share of Sanders supporters self-identify as moderate suggests that this isn’t the view of most Democrats.That’s especially true if they can best Sanders, who is struggling, in an early state.(Recall Sanders in 2016 won more than 49 percent of the vote in the caucuses.)More surprising, 46 percent say they have written off Sanders and Beto O’Rourke (despite a good debate outing, he draws only 1 percent support).AD

Third, the expectations game makes the two early states especially treacherous for Sanders, who at one time might have been considered the favorite in both, given his strong Iowa showing in 2016 and his runaway win in New Hampshire with 60 percent of the vote.Third, Sanders is going nowhere in the polls, apparently has a dysfunctional campaign and has ceded the titles of “biggest crowds” and “most enthusiasm” to Warren.Taking back some of that populist momentum would be huge.”

In 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also pulled in massive crowds for his Democratic presidential run.“When you have the ability to get 20,000 at a rally, it is significant, and your opponents should be concerned.”

Sanders continues to draw some sizable rally crowds, including about 10,000 at a recent event in Denver, and aides like to post pictures of his more impressive crowds on social media.“If you don’t, you can move it, and you can buy into a public plan.”

But Sanders highlighted the ongoing labor dispute in which health care costs have been shifted onto the union backing striking workers.I'm thinking of proposals such as Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' idea for universal rent control, which would cap rent increases everywhere in the United States at 3%, or 1.5 times the rate of inflation (whichever is higher), regardless of local conditions.They also argue that the divisive impacts of some of her policy proposals, including Medicare-for-all — which she supports along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — have not yet been fully presented to the party’s voters.Unlike Sanders, who has admitted that the health insurance program would raise middle- class taxes while aiming to reduce total costs, Warren has refused to answer the question about whether Medicare-for-all would raise middle-class taxes.But there are some staff-level tensions below the surface, as Sanders advisers seek to draw electability comparisons with Warren.An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll on Tuesday showed Warren slightly edging Sanders and Biden among Latinos, and polling higher than Sanders among whites without a college degree.The Sanders campaign has distinguished itself by eagerly pushing back against Biden’s attacks on Medicare-for-all.AD

As candidates were forced to get specific, a split emerged between those such as Bernie Sanders who held fast to the single-payer goal, and others who decided that “Medicare-for-all” didn’t actually have to mean for all.It’s important to note that Sanders himself doesn’t really propose Medicare for all — in his plan, the government program would be much more comprehensive than Medicare is, wouldn’t include cost-sharing (which Medicare does) and would pretty much get rid of Medicare Advantage, the program by which private companies administer Medicare benefits.Not even Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) favors that, so even if Democrats should win back the Senate, a good number of Democrats (out of legitimate fear about what happens when Republicans win it back) likely won’t go along.Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).But according to the other Iowa poll released this month from CBS News and YouGov, Sanders is in a virtual tie for first place with 26 percent of the vote.AD

The implication was that Medicare-for-all would reduce national health expenditures from the “status quo.” When we queried the Sanders campaign during the debate for the source of the $50 trillion figure, we were directed to posts that were written by Paul Waldman for The Washington Post’s “The Plum Line,” an opinion column.All but one of five major studies, from the left to the right, predict the Sanders plan would increase health spending, not reduce it.AD

During our reporting for this fact check, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign said it was not endorsing Waldman’s analysis but was simply supplying a source for the $50 trillion figure that Sanders cited in the heat of the debate.But he declined repeated queries to explain the point Sanders was making with his comparison.The “over $30 trillion” refers to a 2018 study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which has been funded by entities associated with the Koch family, that calculated new federal spending on health care if the Sanders plan were enacted.AD

The Sanders campaign has cited this study to claim his plan would lower health-care costs, but the author, Charles Blahous, has publicly and persistently insisted the campaign has misinterpreted his findings.In particular, he says the “lower-bound” estimate is unrealistic because it assumes Sanders would be successful in reducing payments for treatments now covered by private insurance by 40 percent.“In addition, federal spending would be needed for newly covered individuals, expanded benefits and the elimination of cost sharing for those insured under current law, and the new long-term support and services program.”

Thorpe, a skeptic of the Sanders plan, said he was surprised when Sanders made the comparison during the debate.But a model with no cost-sharing — Sanders’s plan envisions no out-of-pocket spending except for prescription drugs — would have national health expenditures of nearly $41 trillion, or a decline of 13.2 percent.AD

“Bernie is overstating things,” Friedman said.The benefits of Medicare-for-all are substantial enough that there really is no need to exaggerate.”

The Pinocchio Test

Sanders implied during the debate that his Medicare-for-all plan would reduce health-care spending compared to the “status quo” of $50 trillion over 10 years.Instead, he says Sanders was simply pointing to a government estimate for health expenditures over a 10-year period.Since the spokesman declined to explain why Sanders made the comparison, we are left with a conundrum.Similarly, we offered multiple opportunities to the Sanders campaign to explain his statement or acknowledge an honest mistake.Four of the five key studies on the impact of the Sanders plan estimate that national health expenditures will rise over 10 years, while the author of the fifth predicts a decline but says Sanders’s statement is exaggerated.says she’s “with Bernie” Sanders on health care, nobody blinks.AD

With New-York-billionaires-running-for-president being a thing at the time, Bloomberg flirted with a run in 2016, arguing that a contest between Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would offer a choice only between two ideological poles.Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are in competition for many white, working class voters, though Biden also has a strong base of African American support, polls show.In 2016, Hillary Clinton's strong showing in the South helped propel her to victory over Sanders.“Democrats say we have guns in America because of ‘corruption.’ No, we have guns because it’s our God-given right enshrined in the Constitution.”

If you didn't think that "the wall" was Trump's single-minded obsession, note well that Trump as president is doing nothing other than dwell on this: he is not addressing infrastructure, nor health care reform, and certainly not the tax relief that he teased for the middle class just before the mid-term elections.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders went before the press to claim that the months-long delay in handling the Rob Porter situation was the fault of the almost unknown White House Personnel Security Office.Sarah Sanders said: "It is handled by law enforcement and intelligence communities.Even press secretary Sarah Sanders undercut Trump by admitting that the phone call didn't happen.The revealing NBC interview with Lester Holt

Sanders would later testify under oath in the Mueller investigation that she simply made all this up.Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday said that he “hopes very much” that Congress will move to impeach.“The part that I wish got more coverage,” Casten told me when I asked about his media criticisms, “is the fact that there is such massive ideological diversity in the Democratic Party, that it’s a big enough tent to accommodate from AOC and Bernie Sanders out to Dan Lipinski and Joe Manchin, and it means that on almost every policy conversation we’re having, the policy debate is happening in the Democratic Party.”

“On the other side of the aisle, you have from Peter King to Steve King,” Casten said, referring to two well-known Republican congressmen, the latter of whom has been shunned by his party for racist rhetoric.Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have each unveiled their own plans to impose a "wealth tax" on multi-millionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates.Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.A Financial Transaction Tax proposed in the Senate by Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, although less aggressive than Sanders' plan, would raise close to $800 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Sanders' plan would tax more hit more wealthy people and do so at a higher rate, and his campaign says it would halve the wealth held by billionaires in the U.S.In the 2016 presidential election, Sanders proposed an aggressive tax on stocks and bonds as a way to finance his plan to fund tuition-free public colleges and universities.(Sanders is again citing the Wall Street tax as a way to fund his education plan, including student debt forgiveness, in 2020.)
