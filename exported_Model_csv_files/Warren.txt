And Warren’s press coverage of late has been overwhelmingly positive.If there’s anyone you’d expect to be prepared, it would be Warren, who is nothing if not a meticulous planner.Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said, “We’ve got a lot of great people running, but some of these ideas are better left in the college faculty lounge,” a clear reference to Warren, the only former college professor in the race.AD

The tone of Warren’s press coverage will change at some point, too.That’s still going on; here, for instance, is an episode of the New York Times podcast “The Daily” that goes deep inside everything that happens at a Warren rally, with predictably glowing results.And there’s almost no way to write about, for instance, Warren’s almost inhuman ability to spend hours with supporters in a way that doesn’t reflect well on her.AD

Lately you can detect something different in Warren: She’s as critical of Trump as the rest of the candidates, but she’s not trying to get in the muck with him and argue on the terms he sets.Warren, and any other candidate, might take a lesson from Barack Obama, whose “No Drama Obama” philosophy in 2008 was all about sticking to his strategy, rather than getting caught up in the frenzied news cycle and sidetracked by microcontroversies everyone would quickly forget about anyway.Warren’s mantra is “I’ve got a plan for that.” We’ll she if she does.“I think that will kind of continue to give us a slingshot to go into that early primaries day calendar.”

-- Pete Buttigieg accused Elizabeth Warren of being “extremely evasive” when it comes to explaining how she’d finance her Medicare-for-all plan.From ABC News: “Buttigieg was responding to a question about Warren's appearance Wednesday on ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’ in which she said health care costs would decrease but stopped short of saying whether middle-class taxes would increase.From Time: “Maurice Mitchell, the National Director of the Working Families Party (WFP) and an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, received messages calling him a ‘half man’ and ‘Uncle Tom,’ and telling him to ‘go back to his slave masters' … The endorsement, one of the first from a progressive group, was seen a triumph for Warren and a setback for Sanders, who has praised the Working Families Party as an example of ‘my vision of Democratic socialism.’ In the days since, WFP staffers were inundated with messages calling them ‘liberal sellouts,’ ‘corporate frauds,’ and ‘just as corrupt as the DNC,’ often accompanied with the hashtag #BernieorBust.”

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)The Elizabeth Warren backlash is coming.But that was then, and now, Warren is the only Democratic candidate who has successfully executed her initial plan: to build massive campaigns in the early states and compete for a win in Iowa.Warren’s strength was visible all weekend, from the standing ovation she got at Friday’s LGBTQ forum to the friendliest audience at the steak fry.(Warren’s campaign bought half as many tickets as that of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, but her speech got roughly the same response as his, and she edged him in a friendly corn kernel poll on-site.)According to the Selzer poll, Warren is now the most well-liked Democrat in the field, with the most first-choice and second-choice support from voters.Warren, who has twice defended herself from attacks in debates, doesn’t resemble either candidate, but there’s a growing irritation at the how-she-does it media coverage she gets.No candidate has thrived from going after a rival, least of all by attacking Warren, but when the media's focus turns to a candidate, things can change fast.Outside the Warren-Biden-Sanders triad at the top of the polls, just Booker and three other Democrats have double-digit favorables: Harris’s net rating is 39 percent, Klobuchar’s is 30 percent, O’Rourke’s is 28 percent.“It is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now,” Warren said.For now, the poll positions Warren as the candidate with the most first-choice and second-choice support, stitching together a coalition of liberals who backed Sanders in 2016 and Hillary Clinton supporters; Sanders gets no support from Clinton 2016 voters.(NBC-WSJ, 900 registered voters)

Wall Street is sounding the alarm over Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s rise in the Democratic presidential race, as investors start to grapple with the possibility the industry scourge secures her party's nomination.One investor joked that the stock market wouldn't even open if the Massachusetts senator became president; a segment on CNBC featured the idea that married couples could get divorced rather than be subjected to Warren's "wealth tax."There's an emerging consensus that a Warren presidency would hurt the stock market -- yet there’s little evidence that investors are pricing in the risk."From a pure markets perspective, a Warren nomination hardly seemed 'priced in,'" Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group writes.He offers a few theories why that's the case: The election remains far away; Warren could be seen as a weaker Trump foe; or that Warren will moderate her pitch if she secures the nomination.“What could affect the markets, however, is what we have warned about for months: the growing possibility that [Warren] may be the Democrats’ nominee,” Valliere writes.“They won’t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president,” he said to the crowd at the Delivering Alpha Conference, apparently joking.The network just aired a piece suggesting married couples rich enough to face Warren’s wealth tax, which proposes a 2 percent levy on a household's assets greater than $50 million, could avoid it by getting divorced.No matter that Warren’s proposal, if she is nominated then elected, still faces exceedingly long odds in what is expected to be a closely divided Senate.And a new national Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll finds Biden and Warren separating from the rest of the field.Warren is the candidate Trump needs to worry about; simply calling her ‘Pocahontas’ will not be sufficient to stop her momentum.”

Warren's rise hasn't yet weighed on stock prices.Warren — whose largest campaign expense so far has been staffing — will soon launch more than $10 million worth of digital and television ads in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.AD

Warren’s campaign declined to specify the spending breakdown between digital and television ads, but said the focus would be on digital first, with airtime reserved for television ads over the next few months.The ads focus on a familiar theme from Warren’s core message: that she’s not afraid to take on government corruption.The foray into television advertising marks a shift for Warren, who eschewed TV ads in her 2018 reelection bid for the Senate.AD

Warren's strength over the past month has shaken up some of the story lines about her support and which voters she could or could not appeal to within a Democratic primary.Recent Quinnipiac polls had asked about who voters saw as electable or who had better policy ideas; the excitement question comes at that a different way and, for the moment, finds Warren doing well with Democrats she hadn't appealed to previously.By a 60-point margin, white voters with college degrees are excited about a Warren nomination, which clicks with stories about her appeal to white, suburban liberals.She’s spending Thursday and Friday in Las Vegas, joined at one stop by Richard Dreyfuss, who will “offer remarks about the power of civics in American public education.”

AD

Seven out of 10 Democrats said they would be excited if Warren became the Democratic nominee for president in 2020.And the excitement is rooted in Warren’s left-of-center ideas — she has released dozens of plans on an array of topics, including universal child care and getting rid of the electoral college.But this poll suggests that Warren may mostly be taking support from Biden — and that could continue.Nearly 20 percent haven’t heard of Warren.This means there’s a good chance for an uptick in support for Warren.“Would they if our President was an Democrat?”

The trouble for Trump is that facts really do matter.That includes Medicare-for-all, which Klobuchar calls “a bad idea” that would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance plans, and making four-year colleges tuition free, which she says would force blue-collar workers to foot tuition bills of “rich kids.”

These sorts of ideas “are better left in the college faculty lounge,” Klobuchar said in Detroit last week — which sounded like a jab at Warren, a former law professor, although Klobuchar insisted it wasn’t.Klobuchar has said that although Warren has a plethora of plans, her own plans “have deadlines” and are more likely to be passed and implemented.He is leaning toward Warren — although he wishes she would abandon her calls for Medicare-for-all and instead embrace offering a public option, as Klobuchar has done.AD

Warren has throughout the campaign had her strongest support from the most liberal Democrats.Warren’s improvement among less liberal Democrats also means she’s doing slightly better with black voters, who are more ideologically conservative than whites.Warren’s image is also evolving.Respondents were asked whether they prefer elected officials who “make compromises with people they disagree with” or those who “stick to their positions.” Despite Warren’s reputation as a proponent of “uncompromising liberalism,” 34 percent of Democrats who said they prefer compromise are backing her.AD

But views about Warren may also be less crystallized.Assuming Warren continues to get lots of media attention, that number will almost certainly diminish.The implication of all this is that among the three front-runners, Warren appears to be in the best position to pick up supporters when other candidates start to pull the plug.Warren’s rise isn’t about women

Finally, the GW Politics Poll also suggests that Warren’s rise is not being driven mainly by an increase in support among female voters.In an analysis for FiveThirtyEight in September, Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux found that Warren’s polling for most of the campaign had been about three points higher among women than men.In a reversal, our survey has Warren as the first choice of 29 percent of men and 26 percent of women.AD

That suggests that an increase in the support of male voters is responsible for at least part of Warren’s recent trajectory.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could ask Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)AD

Warren’s plan is relatively straightforward: Tax all assets above $50 million at 2 percent per year and all assets above $1 billion at 3 percent per year.According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, Sanders’s tax would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, significantly more than Warren’s version.I like the simplicity of Warren’s approach relative to Bernie’s, but given that any such tax is and will be a tremendous political reach from where we stand today, the important thing is to get these ideas bouncing around the echo chamber.That’s especially true if Sanders or Warren becomes the nominee, since they’d run campaigns centered on the idea that wealthy people have rigged the system in their favor.AD

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)That's why it's highly unusual that a conversation containing no apparent highly classified information got stored there, several former officials from both the Obama and Trump administrations tell the Wall Street Journal's Warren P. Strobel and Andrew Restuccia.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate who’s rising most quickly in the polls, answered this question in September’s Democratic debate by calling for stronger protections for labor and the environment in U.S. trade agreements with other countries.Including labor and environmental protections in trade deals boosts popular support for free trade

These are the kinds of protections Warren wants more of.This suggests that politicians such as Warren may be able to sell new trade deals to the public in nations grappling with populist policymaking and economic nationalism.Expect other politicians besides Warren to turn to them to get trade agreements through.Warren had raised $35.6 million by the end of the second quarter, FEC records show.When not counting transfers, 67 percent of Warren’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less.Warren doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from federal lobbyists or PACs, or fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.As noted, Sanders and Warren each have transferred nearly $10 million from previous campaigns to their 2020 presidential committees.For her 2018 Senate reelection campaign, Warren raised money at events with high-dollar donors.Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, film director Steven Spielberg and actress Barbra Streisand each donated $2,700 to Warren’s Senate campaign.AD

Warren also benefited from some PAC donations when she ran for Senate, though it was a small share of her fundraising, as we explained in this fact check.Warren raised $6 million in donations of $1,000 or more to her 2018 Senate campaign, a spokesman said.“The open secret of Ms. Warren’s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency,” the Times reported this month, noting “trips to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, Martha’s Vineyard, and Philadelphia — all with fundraisers on the agenda.”

The Warren campaign in response to our questions said the average contribution to her Senate campaign in 2018 was $29.45, a sign of broad appeal among grass-roots donors.Warren also “raised or donated $11 million to Democrats running for office and state parties in all 50 states,” a spokesman said.“Elizabeth’s schedule is filled with town halls and selfie lines, not closed-door fundraisers with millionaires and billionaires, because she believes that to take back the White House we need to build a grassroots movement,” Warren spokesman Chris Hayden wrote in an email.The key here is that Sanders and Warren define their presidential campaigns as entirely grass-roots-funded because of their self-imposed restrictions: no hobnobbing with rich donors in closed events and no PAC money, for example.But Warren held high-dollar fundraisers for her 2018 Senate run and then transferred $10.4 million from that campaign account to her presidential committee.But after conservative commentators began to cast doubt on Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign-trail assertion that she was discriminated against while pregnant as a schoolteacher in the early 1970s, Conlin felt the need to look back at this painful chapter in her own life.AD

“It irritates me immensely,” Conlin said in a phone interview, of the attempts to smear Warren’s recounting of her biography.They wrote of contracts not being renewed after they gave birth, and of positions that were revoked, as Warren says hers was.Warren read some of the stories women shared on a video she posted to Twitter on Wednesday.“I can’t believe that there are people out there who do not believe Elizabeth Warren,” she said.“But it’s not an option for a vast majority of workers, because it takes a lot of time and money, and it’s by no means a guarantee.”

Warren has said that as a pregnant teacher in 1971, when she was 22, she was told that a job she had been promised was given to someone else.But Republicans and Twitter commentators have used an old interview from 2007, in which Warren talks about being pregnant, as supposed evidence that she has been misleading.AD

Teachers who worked at the same elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., around the same time told The Post that pregnant teachers like Warren could be easily fired without cause.“To suggest that [Warren] would have been able to keep her job as a teacher while pregnant is absurd,” Conlin said.The conservative Washington Free Beacon’s new top editor, Eliana Johnson, late of Politico and the National Review, kicked off the contretemps with a report Monday that dug up the minutes from the Riverdale, N.J., school board showing that Warren had been offered another term and that her eventual resignation was accepted with regret.AD

The headline: “County Records Contradict Warren’s Claim She Was Fired Over Pregnancy.”

Shockingly, nowhere on these documents is it stamped: “The all-male board fired this young woman because she was pregnant and because of its deep-seated misogyny.” (And, more seriously, nowhere in the story is it indicated that the renewal offer probably came before school district honchos knew Warren was pregnant.)“Another Elizabeth Warren lie about Elizabeth Warren?” tweeted President Trump’s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, who — credit where due — does have proven expertise on the subject of lying.AD

Bush, who framed it as a troubling “character issue” for Warren.This gave Fox a chance to revisit Warren’s earlier blunder over claiming significant Native American ancestry.AD

Elizabeth Warren is no different, liberal darling though she is.And Warren’s campaign seemed to have made a tactical mistake by not responding immediately, though they were given the opportunity by the Free Beacon, according to its story.If Warren had shot back as cannily to this as she did to the recent absurd report that she’d had an affair with a 24-year-old Marine (she wittily tweeted out an image of her alma mater, the University of Houston and their mascots, the Cougars), she could have swatted this away.But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.”

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Warren's tweets.Warren’s comments are just the latest in an escalating feud between the lawmaker and the tech giant.Warren has long called to break up Facebook and other big tech companies, putting her at odds with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.A report last week that Zuckerberg called Warren an “existential threat” to the company have accelerated those tensions.Warren also criticized Facebook for not doing enough to address election interference during the 2016 election, and she raised concerns that the company remains unprepared for 2020.— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019

The Facebook logo is displayed on an iPhone.Journalists are kindly doing President Trump’s work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.(Warren, notably, refused to take the bait.)Leading the pack has been Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies.She garnered immediate support, even from rivals such as Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who retweeted Warren for what he said was the first time.Cruz said “she’s right — Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech.”

AD

Since then, calling out the tech behemoths and other big corporations has been a pillar of Warren’s presidential campaign.Leaked audio from an internal Facebook meeting in July captured Zuckerberg acknowledging that if “someone like” Warren is elected, he expects Facebook to fight back — and prevail — against efforts to break it up in court.A new story about Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.)One of the stories Warren tells about herself, often when describing her desire to improve child care, is about how in her early 20s she was working as a schoolteacher in New Jersey.Yet this seemingly uncontroversial piece of Warren’s biography obviously made some opposition researcher somewhere begin poring over records of the school where Warren worked nearly half a century ago.The result was this article published Monday in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, in which they reveal — hold on to your hats — that the minutes of a school board meeting in April 1971 (when Warren would have been four months pregnant) say that her contract was renewed, while the minutes of a meeting two months later say that her resignation was “accepted with regret.”

To any sane person, this wouldn’t contradict her story at all, since it’s unlikely that the school board minutes would record “Fired Mrs. Warren for getting knocked up.” Nevertheless, the claim that Warren is pulling a fast one shot around the conservative world.Eventually the story reached into the mainstream media, with pieces like this CBS News article which corroborates her story but nonetheless frames it as “Elizabeth Warren stands by account,” as though there is some actual doubt about what happened.It’s hard to believe there are large numbers of voters who will say, “I know Trump is the most corrupt president in history and has told thousands of lies, but I’m not sure I can trust Elizabeth Warren if I can’t be convinced beyond any doubt that her story about leaving a job in 1971 is 100 percent true.”

But that’s not how it works.To repeat, I doubt that their attempt to create a scandal out of Warren’s pregnancy story will work.Now Warren has announced that she will be putting out her health-care plan in the next few weeks.Up until recently, Warren had seemed open to multiple approaches to achieve universal coverage and control costs.AD

AD

But eventually Warren began speaking more firmly about her support for Medicare-for-all.And they do it, as Warren often points out, by collecting as much as possible in premiums and paying out as little as possible in claims.The problem Warren faces is that within the Democratic Party, what used to be a lefty proposal — the creation of a widely available public option resembling Medicare or Medicaid — has now become the conservative position.A couple of years ago, Warren could have said, “I support Medicare-for-all, which is why we should create a public option now, and over time, more people will migrate to it from private insurance.She’d said some of the same things as Warren about insurance companies.Warren could face the same problem.That’s Warren’s dilemma: How can she offer something true to what she has said until now and doesn’t open her up to attacks that prey on the public’s fear of losing their insurance?AD

When Warren says that what matters is the cost people pay and not whether it goes toward taxes or premiums, she’s exactly right.AD

AD

Just to be clear, conservatives, including those in the media, have every right to explore Warren’s history and record to explain to their audiences why she’s the most villainous person to walk the Earth in millennia and, if she became president, would leave America nothing but a rancid heap of burned-out rubble and rotting flesh.At first, someone like Warren is paid only marginal attention — criticized, to be sure, perhaps even mocked, but not with the volume and intensity to come.If Warren continues on her current trajectory, conservative audiences will be told day after day that her prospective presidency will be a nightmare of suffering, a betrayal of what the country represents, an attack on them and everything they stand for.They’ve already given it a shot with one bogus story about Warren, that she supposedly wasn’t telling the truth about losing her job as a teacher in 1971 because she got pregnant.If Warren is going to be that person, how she responds to the onslaught will tell us a lot about her resilience as a candidate.So how on target is Warren?Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, one of the key sources supplied by the Warren campaign as evidence for her position.AD

The Warren campaign also sent us a 2017 report issued by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan group funded at least in part by technology companies, that said “a growing minority of analysts” attribute “a significant share of the [job] losses to increased trade pressure and dwindling U.S. competitiveness” rather than technology.Facebook and Amazon, which Warren has proposed breaking up, “both have seats on ITIF’s board and are supporters,” he said.“I don’t think anyone suggests it was the prime cause.”

AD

The Warren campaign pointed to a study, looking at the period 1999-2018 for the decline in the employment-population ratio, that cited two major contributing factors — import competition from China and adoption of industrial robots — and a host of contributing factors.Yet Warren said “bad trade policy” was the “principal reason” for job loss, dismissing concerns about automation.Even researchers who do not accept the Ball State findings are not willing to go as far as Warren, in part because more research needs to be done in untangling the interplay between trade and automation.Warren also could have not been so definitive.AD

Warren nodded, and as he advised, she said nothing.Warren said nothing until she returned to UH to eulogize a man who had been both a promoter and tormentor, a man who, as she put it in an interview, “no longer had any power over me.”

At Smith’s funeral, Warren told the story in an entertaining way.‘Testing her’

The University of Houston Law Center was in a period of transition when Warren interviewed there in 1978.Warren was almost 29, and she knew the campus.A decade earlier, she had dropped out of college to marry her high school sweetheart, Jim Warren.Elizabeth Warren in 1970 in a University of Houston photo.(UH) (N/A/University of Houston)

Warren earned her law degree from Rutgers just before giving birth to her second child.Gene Smith, who had talked to Warren by phone, met her at the airport, picking her up in his white 1966 Lincoln Continental.In a story that quickly made the rounds among the faculty ― and that Warren later retold at his funeral — Smith ordered a steak, even though his arms were so weak he had trouble cutting it into smaller pieces.The waitress usually helped, but this time, when the steak arrived, Smith pushed the plate over to Warren and ordered her to cut it up for him.Warren just stared at Smith.Everyone at the table laughed, including Smith, who advocated for Warren to be hired.“I knew it from the first minute,” Warren said.As Warren had anticipated, some questioned her academic background.… You knew, just by talking to her, she was going to be successful.”

Warren was hired as an assistant professor, a full-time tenure-track position that included not only legal writing courses but also contracts and commercial law.Warren said she could not remember whether her status as a wife and mother came up in her interviews for the job, but she specifically requested to teach complex financial courses because she thought it might help her be taken more seriously by her colleagues.According to personnel records released by the Warren campaign, her pay that first year was $20,500 — not much more than the $8,000 a semester she had been paid to teach legal writing one night a week at Rutgers.“I was constantly reminded that I didn’t look like a real law professor,” Warren said.If Warren saw herself as a trailblazer for women in law, she has never acknowledged it.Her mother had long warned her, she has said, about becoming “one of those crazy women’s-libbers.” And according to those who knew her at the time, Warren, then a Republican, did not espouse feminist beliefs.But in an interview, Warren recalled being acutely aware of her status as one of the only women on the staff.“It was a lonely experience.”

‘Warren in the making’

For UH law students, Warren was one of their first instructors, teaching contracts, a fundamental course that tends to determine whether a student has a mind for the law.Warren taught in a large lecture hall that resembled an amphitheater.And Warren knew by looking at their faces that she wasn’t connecting with them in the way she wanted.Mixon had won multiple teaching awards, and Warren went to him for advice.Three days a week, after Warren’s contracts class, they would go to lunch at a nearby Mexican restaurant.Some people, especially those cowering in the back, “were scared sh--less of her,” recalled Tracey Conwell, a Houston litigation attorney who took contracts and several other classes with Warren.At one point in the semester, Conwell recalled, a group of her classmates drew up bingo cards with students’ names as they sought to game out Warren’s strategy.One day, Conwell remembered, she and Warren sparred over the philosophical meaning of the word “intent” in contract law, and Warren abruptly cut her off.But the next class, Warren gave Conwell a book: “The Death of Contract,” a controversial 1974 publication that questioned the basis of modern contract law.After that, she said, she and Warren “were buddies.”

“It made clear to me that she was an obviously insightful thinker who had read more than the standard books to arrive at her own concepts about how the law works,” Conwell said.… And that approach, I think, helped her take this really complicated and dreadfully boring stuff and make it really interesting.”

Michael Olivas, a longtime UH law professor who was hired after Warren, recalled sitting in on her classes and being stunned by how good she was.“She was not Elizabeth Warren yet, but she was Elizabeth Warren in the making,” Olivas said.Warren played on a softball team at the UH during the years she taught at the law school.“It just feels the same when you see her on television and she’s trying to explain something and she says, ‘Look, it’s like this,’ or she gets very animated and says, ‘Here’s the thing,’ ” said Rita Lucido, a Houston family-law attorney who took classes with Warren.“I don’t look back and think of contracts as this dry subject, because she made such an effort to keep us engaged with her and to make sure it made sense to us not only from a legal perspective but a real-world perspective.”

Warren was younger and less stuffy than the men on the faculty.Warren also seemed human.Dona Bolding, who was in Warren’s 1979 contracts class, recounted the time she was shopping at Loehmann’s, the discount department store known for its marked-down designer clothing, and ran into Warren standing in her underwear in the store’s communal dressing room.Bolding said she was “mortified.” But Warren instantly made light of the situation.“Oh Miss Bolding,” Warren called out.”

‘The breaking point’

Warren loved her job.But, according to Warren, he was also increasingly a harasser: He commented on her clothes and appearance in ways that made her feel uncomfortable.Warren thought she was managing him until that day in early 1979 when she said he lunged for her in his office.Elizabeth Warren, on Gene Smith

She considered punching him in the face, she said in an interview.And so, when he chased me around his office, I wasn’t afraid of him physically so much as I was afraid of what I knew he could take away from me.”

Warren already instinctively knew silence was her only real option, even before Mixon told her.And that’s what I did.”

As Warren was trying to hang on to her job at UH that first year, her life at home was falling apart.“Child care nearly brought me down,” Warren often says, until her mother’s sister, Bess Reed Veneck, came to Houston from Oklahoma to help out with the kids.Bess Reed Veneck — Aunt Bee — with Warren's children, Alexander and Amelia, circa 1978.(Warren campaign)

But Aunt Bee, as the senator calls her, couldn’t fix what was wrong with Warren’s marriage.By Warren’s telling, she and Jim never really fought.When they were on their high school debate team together, Jim had been drawn to her because she was smart and driven, Warren remembered.“I think we were both shocked by who I turned out to be 10 years later,” Warren said.I kept changing and growing almost despite myself.”

Teaching law, Warren said, “was when the whole world opened up for me.” It was impossible to put her ambitions back into a box and close it away, not even to save her marriage.Elizabeth Warren

Warren filed for divorce from Jim on Nov. 5, 1979.Jim agreed to pay child support that increased by 5 percent a year, as well as contributing to their kids’ college educations, an unusual detail even now, according to Susan Myres, a former Warren student at UH who is now a top divorce attorney in Houston.The agreement, Myres said, reads as if it was written by “a future consumer advocate in the making.”

While Warren has been careful to call her ex-husband “a good man,” she has occasionally hinted at bitterness.While Jim had struggled with Warren’s ambition, Mann embraced it.The two were married in July 1980, shortly after Warren’s 31st birthday, and Mann gave up his tenure-track job and moved to Houston, where UH gave him a one-year teaching contract.Warren was awarded tenure and named assistant dean of the law center.Warren, her second husband and her two children were heading to the University of Texas Law School in Austin, leaving Houston behind.‘A homecoming’

In Warren’s diagnosis, the problem is oligarchic capture of our political economy.Over and over, Warren says shrinking from “big fights” is the wrong thing to be signaling an intention to do — contra Buttigieg, the prospect of deep divisions after Trump calls for more ambitious reform efforts.Thus Warren proposes deep reforms to rid Washington of corruption and to restructure the economy.Senator Elizabeth Warren (REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo)

The Campaign

MORE DEMOCRATS VIEW WARREN AS ELECTABLE: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)That's according to Avalanche Strategy, a liberal communications firm, which found that now "Warren leads in both the traditional horse race question (29%) and as the preferred president when electability is factored out (32%)."Avalanche CEO Michiah Prull explains in the study provided early to Power Up: “Warren’s rise in these polls suggests that voters increasingly believe that she can overcome the perceived electability gap and win the election.While many voters continue to believe that their fellow citizens may be less likely to support a female candidate, Warren appears to be persuading many that she can overcome this challenge."“Warren’s rise in these polls suggests that voters increasingly believe that she can overcome the perceived electability gap and win the election.While many voters continue to believe that their fellow citizens may be less likely to support a female candidate, Warren appears to be persuading many that she can overcome this challenge."When presented a list of choices, 70% of respondents said they based this on “combined narrative of systematic inequality in America.”

But the most interesting part is how Warren closes the gap.But they believe Warren can overcome this challenge.In the CBS News-YouGov poll released on Sunday, Warren and Biden are tied in Iowa at 22 percent, statistically tied with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who is at 21 percent.A warning to Biden, however: 51 percent are “somewhat satisfied” with Biden’s response to Trump’s attacks, while only 23 percent are “very satisfied.”

In New Hampshire, the same poll has Warren at 32 percent, Biden at 24, Sanders at 17 and Buttigieg at 7.AD

Warren now faces the challenges that come with front-runner status, including dealing with high expectations for the early primaries and being the target of attacks from opponents and of criticism from the media.Beyond that, Warren might plan to take the wind out of the predictable attacks she will face.Warren would do well to issue a robust condemnation of Trump’s retreat from Syria and explain how she would wind down “forever wars” without endangering allies, giving a shot in the arm to Islamic State terrorists and losing allies’ confidence.The answer to criticism cannot be to ridicule critics as “thinking small,” nor can every explanation for achieving unreasonable goals be “I’ll fight.”

Anyone who read "A Fighting Chance," Warren's first political memoir, read the story of how she stopped teaching special-needs students."By the end of the school year, I was pretty obviously pregnant," Warren wrote in 2014.Five and a half years later, before a Friday night crowd in San Diego, Warren told the same story, with a few new flourishes.The principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.”

It's a foundational story for Warren, which was why danger loomed for her over the weekend when the story came into question.First, in a tweet, the Jacobin writer Meagan Day pointed to a 2007 speech in which Warren described her departure from teaching in a different way."I did that for a year," Warren said of teaching, "and then that summer, I actually didn't have the education courses, so I was on an emergency certificate, it was called."Day's initial point was that the experience of Warren, who tells audiences that she had a "calling" to become a public school teacher, didn't exactly square with the short time she spent teaching.Mediaite, followed by a series of conservative media outlets, reportedly flatly that Warren had "lied" about pregnancy costing her a job.And on Monday afternoon, the Washington Free Beacon published the minutes of meetings in which the Riverside, N.J., board of education first confirmed that Warren had been rehired and then, two months later, said that she had resigned.Warren, whose early campaign struggled to recover from her past claims of Native American heritage, had been much more ready for this story.But the other outlets' stories moved faster than expected, and Warren went on camera with CBS News, supplementing that with tweets in which she stood by her personal narrative.The Warren campaign's response was fast, but it did not stop the initial speculation about her truthfulness.By Tuesday afternoon, the takes on Warren had fallen close to partisan lines, with conservative media portraying it as another round of possible biography inflation (Fox News: "Warren faces mounting questions on another part of her personal story") and liberal or nonpartisan media portraying it as the candidate debunking accusations (NBC News: "Elizabeth Warren stands by account of pregnancy discrimination").On social media, people who both do and do not support Warren chimed in with accounts of mothers, or female relatives, or themselves losing jobs because of pregnancy."This happened to women ALL the time... why the attacks on Elizabeth Warren?"The Warren campaign avoided, for now, a debacle along the lines of the DNA test.Among other campaigns, there was some frustration at how the Riverside minutes, initially packaged as evidence to debunk Warren, ended up matching her timeline, especially after contemporary documentation of how pregnant women did not have true job protection until several years later.Elizabeth Warren.He told Fox News, when asked about the Warren pregnancy story, that candidates were all “going to go through this X-ray of the soul" and that "the people who have been consistent and truthful about where they are, are going to stand up well."“And you have a couple individuals here who I think have a unique ability to inspire young people, so we’re excited about the direction of this campaign.”

The quick backstory: A reporter for the socialist Jacobin magazine raised the specter of doubt about Warren’s claims in a tweet last week.Then on Monday, the conservative Washington Free Beacon reported that documents show that the school board in New Jersey where Warren worked had approved a second-year teaching contract for her, thus supposedly contradicting her claims that she was asked not to return to teaching because of her pregnancy.Political adversaries have circulated a newly surfaced video of Warren saying she left public school teaching after taking a few graduate school courses and determining that teaching was not “going to work out” for her.Conservatives on outlets such as Fox News have compared the inconsistency to Warren’s past claims that she had Native American ancestry, which eventually led to her apologizing last year to multiple tribes after recognizing that they determine their membership, not DNA tests.For them, not only is Warren’s story to be believed but so are all of the other stories from women about a workplace discrimination issue that has gotten too little attention: employment insecurity for expectant mothers.“To believe Warren is lying, one need be blind to the history of discrimination in ‘pink collar’ professions like teaching where pregnancy was a fireable offense, so much so that Congress passed Title VII in 1978 to outlaw the practice of dismissing pregnant professionals,” he tweeted.These practices persisted into the 1960s and 1970s.”

The type of discrimination Warren claims she experienced in the 1970s existed across socioeconomic classes, although it manifested in different ways, said Joan C. Williams, founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law, an advocacy organization at the University of California Hastings College of the Law that focuses on gender equity issues in the workplace.“It has not disappeared, and it will not disappear until we stop defining the ideal worker as someone who takes no time off for child-rearing and childbearing.”

For many women following the issue, Warren’s experience reminds them of their own stories and the ways the issue persists.Warren did not have a bad debate, but she had her worst to date.He managed to deliver a rare snub to Warren by agreeing the candidates should be honest about taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all.(After previous massive crowds, a Warren event at a half-filled smaller venue attracted notice, putting additional pressure on her advance team to keep crowd size up.)One could argue that in the general election, Warren is better off without the boosterism of the furthest-left House members, but it does set back her effort to solidify support among the most progressive Democratic primary voters.AD

No, the import last week’s events is not that she is done for or in trouble but that no one including Warren has a lock or even substantial advantage in the Democratic primary.There are a handful of candidates with a plausible path to the nomination, of which Warren is one but, as we witnessed last week, certainly not the only one.We need regulation and reform.”

She has leads in some polls, nationally and in early-voting states.Still, with Biden focused on how to respond to President Trump and Sanders having his own problems, this is the moment Warren could stand out in a way she hasn’t yet on the debate stage: as the unequivocal leader.His biggest moments on the debate stages so far have come from criticizing Warren and Sanders’s take-it-or-leave-it liberal policy proposals, so there could be an opening there for him to be more aggressive — and more noticeable.And all are circling the state with trapeze nets, waiting for voters to see some flaws in former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)“What this election is about is vision, and I've got a vision that's different than all of my competitors.”

Democrats, always ready to worry about something new, worry about a joke landing too well.Asked whether Warren would beat Trump, 56 percent of Democrats say she would — up from 39 percent in June.Even more telling of Warren's position is the confidence Democrats have about who could handle attacks from Trump.That's a sea change from six or even three months ago, when the conventional wisdom was that the president, who had goaded Warren into taking a DNA test, would pummel her out of contention by calling her “Pocahontas.” The president has continued to refer to the senator from Massachusetts with that nickname, which he appropriated from anti-Warren conservative media in Massachusetts.In a talk with ABC News, he was more game than usual to draw a contrast with Sen.

The best way to explain that latter movement is to look at Warren’s support vs. that of former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke.Nine percent of O’Rourke’s support in September moved to Warren.None of Warren’s moved to O’Rourke.So the line connecting them is relatively wide on O’Rourke’s end — and a point on Warren’s.The overall picture for Warren, though, reflects something that FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver wrote Monday: Warren has benefited from winning support from a number of other candidates, not really — and even not especially — from Biden.Also important: Sanders kept less of his support than Warren or Biden, though still more than Harris.Warren and Biden were the two biggest beneficiaries.For all of the tracking of voter choices and the broad trends we can observe (like Warren’s improvement over time), many voters are still not firmly committed to particular candidates.It’s worth reiterating the important corollary to that point about fluidity, though: No candidate proved better at not losing support over the past month in these early states than Warren.“I find her message much less clear,” said Beth Malikowski, 58, who wore a 2016 Hillary Clinton T-shirt to Elizabeth Warren's Thursday night town hall here.“We do see more people now pondering out loud how/if Elizabeth Warren could broaden her base in a general election.The National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents around 15,000 California nurses, endorsed Harris in her 2016 Senate race; last month, its members voted to support Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.But Joe Biden's been around forever; Elizabeth Warren's been around a really long time.Warren's campaign has held five “barnstorming” events in major cities, similar to the Sanders campaign, to sign up and train supporters.Elizabeth Warren initially hesitated when asked whether her ethics plan would prevent a Hunter Biden-style situation: a member of a vice president's family getting a job with a foreign company.Three years ago, he won 52 percent of their votes in Wisconsin, and he's now at 44 percent with them against Warren, 43 percent against Sanders and 41 percent against Biden.South Carolina Democratic primary (Fox News, 803 Democrats)

Warren found herself on defense for much of the first half-hour of the debate.“I think the thing closest to universal basic income is Social Security,” Warren said, arguing that her proposal for strengthening Social Security would do more to protect vulnerable Americans than Yang’s plan.In the first policy debate of the evening, Warren and Buttigieg sparred over whether middle-class taxes would go up under Medicare-for-all.“I have made clear what my principles are here: Costs will go up for the wealthy and for corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” Warren said.Buttigieg, who has previously accused Warren of being “evasive” on that question, said she was doing so again on the debate stage.Warren faced more flak from another opponent: Klobuchar, who argued Warren was “making Republican talking points right now in this room.”

Klobuchar also prompted applause from the crowd — a rarity so far this evening — when she raised the issue of the opioid epidemic.Warren got the first question, on why she believes Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than leaving the issue of Trump’s fitness for office up to the voters to decide next November.South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg: Something that has struck me about Buttigieg’s poll numbers: He has often been one of the most popular candidates among Democratic voters — as in, as high as the second-most-popular candidate in the first two states, behind Elizabeth Warren.He really needs to show something, though — especially with Warren rising.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.): I’ve had Warren atop this list for a while, but now she’s a significantly bigger favorite than before.The top fundraisers of the quarter were Sanders ($25.3 million); Warren ($24.7 million); Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.Among the Warren campaign’s biggest expenses were $7.5 million in payroll; $3.5 million in digital media; and $834,000 in travel.Warren, who has begun to eclipse Sanders’s standing among the Democratic Party’s most liberal voters, has not yet released her third-quarter fundraising totals.No other candidate polled more than 3 percent.” Warren has been steadily climbing (up 10 percent since August polling) while Biden gradually has been slightly declining (down 4 percent since August).While Biden is punching back against Trump and spurious accusations against himself, he has yet to puncture Warren’s appeal.For him, the real question is: How and when does he take on Warren’s progressivism?That brings us to the second question, this one concerning Warren.Warren’s big open question: Can she draw from all segments of the party — including moderates and African Americans (many of whom are moderate) — without losing her base?If he does drift down in polling, the assumption is that Warren would win the lion’s share of his voters, but that is far from certain.Meanwhile, Sanders is the top second choice for Warren supporters, but only by a small margin (24 percent for Sanders versus 21 percent for Biden).His political persona has generally been that of a genial Midwesterner, but lately he has sharpened his words not only against Warren (D-Mass.)“We’re not electing a planner,” Biden said last week, a thinly veiled jab at Warren, who has made “I have a plan for that” a core refrain in her stump speeches..The “grass roots” comment referred to yet another spat among the Democrats, one that arose after Warren vowed last week to eschew big-dollar donors if she is the Democratic presidential nominee.AD

Warren, who has risen steadily in the polls and now leads in some of them, has avoided responding directly to Buttigieg.The Warren campaign said the rule was retroactive and that they intend to return donations that do not meet the new guidelines.Take Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).In return, Warren saw an impressive 9.6-point gain in the polls, according to the average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.Sanders’s position in the polls remained about even over those three months — and he paid several million dollars more than Warren for the privilege.His standing in the polls moved around a lot, which was in part a function of his relative polling strength coming into the period and in part a function of at least one iffy debate performance, but he ended up shedding a few points while nearly matching Warren’s spending.In fact, if we look at the change in polling as a function of money spent, Yang’s modest spending and modest poll improvement was about as efficient as Warren’s bigger gains and bigger buys.Warren gained about 0.5 points for each of the millions she spent — as did Yang, even though he spent far fewer millions.Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) pressed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.Warren hit back by touting her recent pledge to turn down contributions over $200 from executives at large tech companies as many 2020 Democratic candidates -- including Harris -- have been aggressively fundraising in Silicon Valley.“You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws,” Warren said.Warren’s plan to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon has emerged as the buzziest tech proposal on the campaign trail.But other Democrats don’t think antitrust action will solve the tech industry’s challenges -- and as Warren surges in the polls, they did more to highlight those distinctions onstage last night."As usual, Senator Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem," said Andrew Yang, a New York-based tech entrepreneur who has garnered attention in Silicon Valley for his positions on automation.Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are,” he said.The Hill

Aside from a few well-placed jabs from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Warren has faced no real criticism from her rivals despite her climb to the top of the polls.Buttigieg laid into Warren most aggressively for refusing to say whether taxes will go up to pay for her Medicare-for-all plan and for ignoring how unwise it would be to attempt this in a country as divided as ours, especially when alternatives are available.Even Andrew Yang got in a shot, explaining that Warren’s wealth tax idea has been tried and repealed in other countries when the plans didn’t work.In the long run, Warren’s bigger problem might be her answer seemingly to agree with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) on Syria and arguing in favor of getting all U.S. troops out of the Middle East (“I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East.I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East,” Warren said).Overall, Buttigieg had his best debate, not only cutting Warren down to size on hiding her tax plan but giving a shoutout to the Midwest, where Democrats too often ignored deindustrialization.He was feisty and slyly got in a dig at Warren for saying we should be honest about raising taxes.She also hit Warren on Medicare-for-all, saying there is a difference between “a plan and a pipe dream.” She also pushed back on the Massachusetts senator for accusing others of defending billionaires.Losers: Warren, Medicare-for-all, kicking Trump off Twitter, O’Rourke.(John Minchillo/AP)

THE FRONT-RUNNER TREATMENT: It's clear that the 2020 Democrats see Sen.

Beto O’Rourke attacked Warren for “being punitive" by pushing for a wealth tax on the richest Americans, saying she's "pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions."Warren's proposal for an annual tax on households with a net worth above $50 million has central to her campaign.Even businessman Andrew Yang took a swing at Warren, who has asserted that automation is “a good story, except that it's not really true” and that bad trade policy is the principal reason for people might lose their jobs.Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation,” said Yang.They see what's happening around them … Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.”

But Warren escaped relatively unscathed: She used the onslaught of attacks against her into an opportunity to cast her opponents as corporatists entrenched in the political system or as too “small-minded or timid for the moment,” as Toluse, Chelsea and Matt write.Key quote: “Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,” Warren said.“Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,” Warren said.Warren's team embraced the criticisms as signs of ascendancy: Warren “has built momentum by running a campaign of substance, identifying problems facing the country and laying out her plans for big structural change to fix them,” her communications director wrote in an email.Shade: "I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law," Warren responded."I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law," Warren responded.BIG THEME: Attacks on Elizabeth Warren who has been rising in many polls.In comparison:

Klobuchar seizes the moment: "The Minnesota senator arguably made herself Warren’s chief foil in this debate, creating contrasts on taxes, Medicare-for-all and other issues," Aaron writes."At one point, she rejected the charge that she was creating a Republican talking point by pressing Warren on whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would raise taxes on the middle class.The first Democrats to announce their candidacies for 2020 — Elizabeth Warren, Kamala D. Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie Sanders and Buttigieg — had either co-sponsored the Sanders legislation or vocally endorsed the policy.Buttigieg’s case against Medicare-for-all was aimed at Warren, who, unlike Sanders, won’t answer the question about whether taxes will go up.He held a post-debate media gaggle in Ohio, as he has done around previous debates, and attacked Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in starker terms that he'd used onstage.She introduced a new “justice for rural America” plan while in Iowa, with the centerpiece of new business tax credits; $10,000 for businesses “that hire in rural zones for each full time job they create, with a maximum tax credit of $250,000 per year.”

Elizabeth Warren.On Tuesday, Warren, the rising candidate, came under sharp criticism from several rivals over the specifics of some of her many plans, the tone of her rhetoric and her repeated unwillingness to answer a direct question about health care and taxes.AD

AD

Warren has benefited from a succession of steady and effective debate performances, reflecting the discipline she has brought to other aspects of her campaign.“We had a great moment last debate, and it didn’t do much for us in terms of poll movement.”

On Tuesday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) trained her sights on Warren, attacking her fellow senator on health care, in particular why Warren would not say whether her plan for Medicare-for-all would require raising taxes on middle-class Americans.His exchange with Warren was about who had gotten big changes enacted into law, and a brief moment of testiness was palpable, foreshadowing the campaign to come.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)Elizabeth Warren.It's one of these debates' great mysteries: Why do Warren's rivals keep telegraphing how they're going to attack her?Just because they're different than Elizabeth's doesn't mean they're not bold.”)

Nothing, in other words, came at Warren like a surprise.A curious mythology has been built around Warren's success so far, crediting that success on opponents' reluctance to attack her.But this was actually the third time, in a row, that Warren was accused of making impossible promises, especially on health care, and she was ready for it, making the memorable promise not to “sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.”

Worst moment: A minor slip in an exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), when Warren said she didn't want “troops in the Middle East,” forcing her campaign to clarify that she meant “combat troops.” But none of her rivals pounced until after the debate, and it's not clear that anti-interventionism is a loser with Democratic voters.Donors with doubts about Biden have been waiting for the senator from Minnesota to come into her own as a centrist alternative; specifically, they were waiting for her to supplement her own pitch with a case against Warren and Sanders.She did so, though there hasn’t been much demand, among Democrats, for the sort of attacks Klobuchar decided on — a line about “the difference between a plan and a pipe dream” fed right into Warren’s argument that other Democrats simply ruled out big ideas.Worst moment: Klobuchar began one volley against Warren by saying she was “tired of hearing, whenever I say these things, oh, it's Republican talking points.” Warren had called attacks on Medicare-for-all “Republican talking points” two debates earlier, but not on Tuesday.Best moment: A great joke at both Warren's and Tom Steyer's expense: “No one on this stage wants to protect billionaires.Worst moment: The baffling minute when O'Rourke asked Warren if she'd raise taxes on families that make less than $250,000 per year, when Warren was reiterating that her signature policies were paid for by a wealth tax.He teamed up with Warren to defend Medicare-for-all.Sometimes it worked, as there’s definitely an audience for attacks on Warren’s Medicare positioning.Sometimes it made much less sense, like when the South Bend, Ind., mayor followed up on Warren’s case for a wealth tax by asking what Democrats would do to win Midwestern voters who picked Trump “because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything.” Warren had actually offered a popular policy — the wealth tax — while Buttigieg hadn’t.Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, one of Harris's surrogates, argued that the president's abusive tweets were especially threatening to nonwhite voters, and that Warren, revealingly, didn't appreciate that.Worst moment: The strange decision to impugn Warren over her wealth tax while promoting the far less popular Value Added Tax (VAT), a regressive sales tax.Instead, Gabbard largely fell flat, bungling two attacks on Warren (one of them cut off by a commercial break) and repeatedly taking Republican-friendly stances that have little support among Democrats.READING LIST

This time it was Sen.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) suggested Warren wasn’t being “honest” in how she talks about the issue.Sen. Amy Klobuchar just accused Sen. Elizabeth Warren of essentially peddling a "pipe dream" with her healthcare plan rather than a plan that can be realistically implemented.Last night, Warren returned again and again to the theme of bankruptcy stemming from medical bills (we recently wrote a Health 202 about this very problem), saying she has heard from people with multiple sclerosis, diabetes and cancer about the costs they incurred.“They all had great health insurance right at the beginning,” Warren said.“But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.”

Our Post colleague Robert Costa:

Warren continues to get a lot of space and time to flesh out position.Warren reminded people that even when abortions were illegal, women still had access to the procedure if they could afford to travel to places where it was legal.The ad, titled “Makes More Sense,” cites Buttigieg’s health-care plan, contrasting it with the Medicare-for-all proposal touted by Sanders and Warren and framing the South Bend, Ind.On health care, Buttigieg accuses Warren and Sanders of not trusting the American people to choose the right health care plans for themselves.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)Now it is Warren’s time in the frying pan.Marc Lacey, an editor at the New York Times, which is co-hosting the debate with CNN, asks the question Warren won’t answer.Warren still won’t answer.Warren, a former high school debate champion, responds this time with a double negative.Others want to turn Warren’s strategy of not admitting what everyone knows into a proxy for her character.Warren bites back by saying the mayor’s plan — Medicare-for-all who want it — is really “Medicare-for-all who can afford it.” Snap.Warren, he says, wants to disrupt and divide the day after Trump leaves office.“Well, at least that’s a straightforward answer,” says Buttigieg, getting in yet another dig at Warren.Both Klobuchar and Biden chime in to hit the same points on Warren’s refusal to say what her policy would do.They score blow after blow, and in response, Warren keeps lapsing into her stump speech, talking about how the middle class has been hollowed out.Warren talks about bad trade deals.Yang challenges Warren for not adopting his universal basic income plan, which would pay adults $1,000 a month.Warren responds by saying she supports increases in Social Security payments.But Warren is not ready to give up the class struggle.Klobuchar does not want to lose the pile-on-Warren thread.“Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.” Warren is dismissive, without actually engaging with Klobuchar.“Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,” Warren says.A discussion continues about the wealth tax embraced by Warren.O’Rourke says it is part of a solution, but worries that Warren is being “punitive.” This gives Warren a chance to say she is “really shocked” that anyone would consider her punitive and to lapse into another part of her stump speech, where she says the wealthy got help from public infrastructure and need to “pitch in” to pay some of it back.Warren says she wants to get out of Syria but in a smarter way, and she appears to be reading talking points from a piece of paper on her podium.Warren, 70, basically dares anyone to keep up with her.Then she tries to ask Warren to justify her qualifications to lead the military, but the moderators cut her off and go to another commercial break.Warren is particularly bothered by Amazon’s ability to gather information from vendors on its network and then use that information to compete with those vendors.She asks Warren to join her in demanding that Twitter suspend Trump’s account for violating the rules.“No,” says Warren.Castro and Warren say they are interested in the ideas.Rather than respond on Medicare-for-all, Warren begins listing off all the things she got done while working in the Obama administration fighting for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Warren can’t manage to return the compliment, at least not directly.Warren talks about Charles Fried, a Republican solicitor general who helped her get a job.Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)“I just saw how they beat up on Hillary Clinton, and I’m afraid they’re going to do the same thing to [Warren].”

Semans told The Post he had not expected such a response from Warren, and appreciated her remarks.He believed the 2020 Democratic candidates were taking Native American issues far more seriously than in any other contest he can remember, and praised candidates such as Warren and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro for releasing multipronged policy proposals.How about Hillary Clinton?”

Supporters say she has been glued to the Democratic primary contest and has spoken with some frequency with Warren and Biden, among others.Asked about Clinton by reporters at a Des Moines high school on Monday, Warren parried: “Do you have a question about education?” Asked later what role Clinton should play in 2020, she replied, “I do not have any comment on that.”

Warren has been criticized for weeks for refusing to say how she’d fund the massive program, eventually saying Sunday that she would release a detailed funding plan in the next few weeks.As she works to build a national campaign, Warren also has faced criticism from Iowa Democrats concerned about her absences.I don’t know why she’s not here, but people have noticed,” said Steve Drahozal, the chairman of the Dubuque County Democratic Party, who said he has appealed to the Warren campaign several times for the candidate to visit.Buttigieg is matching Warren’s formidable ground game in Iowa, according to county Democratic chairs.In June, Sanders added to his education policy package when he announced a plan to forgive $1.6 trillion in existing student loans — an extension of a policy that Warren introduced.His plan mirrors Sen.

Sanders and Warren came in significantly ahead of their rival Democrats for the quarter.Warren took in money from 509,000 individual donors over the three-month period, with a total of 943,000 donations — meaning that many of her donors gave more than once.Warren posted $19.1 million in the second quarter and ended that period with $19.7 million in cash, the campaign said.I can stand up to him.’ I would seize that.”

One factor raising alarm is that Biden raised only $15.2 million over the past three months, putting him in fourth place among the candidates and well behind Sanders and Warren, who have built grass-roots fundraising networks.The flurry of impeachment news and distractions for Sanders and Biden have accrued so far to Warren’s benefit, disrupting other Democrats’ efforts to more directly challenge her ideas and background.Warren took the lead in several state and national polls last month, and she is widely seen as building the most accomplished campaign.“My sense is the person who is getting the best of this is Elizabeth Warren.That’s a fundamental decision that Democratic primary voters need to make a decision on.”

The now-overshadowed attacks focused on whether Warren was the person she claimed to be, and whether her plans, including Medicare-for-all, would alienate general-election voters.South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has called Warren “extremely evasive” about the details of her health plans.I’m not sure that confronting her is going to have the impact that other campaigns want.”

As Warren has steadily marched upward in the polls, the reality that she could become the nominee has unsettled some of the party’s top donors, who worry that she would hand the race to Trump.“So if he [Biden] doesn’t measure up, that’s where you start to feel angst in the donor community.”

Another major Democratic donor, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said he and other donors seeking a moderate as a nominee have “zero interest in coming around to Elizabeth Warren.” If she’s the nominee, “we can’t vote for her or Donald Trump” and would sit out the election, he said.The donor also expressed worries that if Warren is the nominee, her presence would ruin any Democratic chances to win the Senate, because voters would perceive having a Republican majority as “the only way to keep her in check” as president.Former vice president Joe Biden faces questions about his son’s role in Ukraine, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)And in an interview with ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” Sanders, who often brushes aside questions about his differences with Warren, noted that she identifies strongly as a capitalist and he does not.All this was happening after the senator was maintaining a breakneck campaign pace amid a growing threat from Warren’s rise.Biden and Warren probably will face scrutiny on other fronts during the debate, strategists said.Warren has been steadily climbing in the polls, prompting more scrutiny of her left-leaning policies, including her support for Medicare-for-all and how it would affect middle-class taxes.As in many of his statements, there was a reminder that Sen.

“Zuckerberg himself said Facebook is 'more like a government than a traditional company,'” Warren tweeted.She made her first campaign stop in Seattle, albeit to a smaller crowd than the one Warren spoke to last month.His campaign has spent the past quarter aggressively building its operation and investing in early states, notably rolling out television ads in Iowa that seek to differentiate Buttigieg from Warren and Sanders when it comes to health care.The endorsements suggest that despite Warren’s recent rise, the fight for the allegiance of the party’s liberal wing is far from over, and that Sanders still commands the loyalty of many Democrats who want the party to move sharply to the left.Both Sanders and Warren aggressively courted Ocasio-Cortez, collaborating on legislation with the congresswoman, dining with her and showing support for her on social media.), who represents a district in Warren’s home state and is publicly neutral.“But I think it’s helpful for him to do that and it’s certainly only a decision that he can make, but I do think this is an opportunity for him to talk.”

Though Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters he agreed with Trump, calling it “a lynching in every sense,” the comparison largely drew condemnation from across the political world, from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and former Florida governor Jeb Bush to Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) and presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren.He is 78 and in his second run for the nomination is no longer a novelty, which Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.Besides, it is entertaining to count how many times Warren plans to spend the same revenue from her wealth tax before it is declared unconstitutional (see Article I, Section 9).Warren is not suited to make them swing away from Trump.In 2018, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, whose un-Warrenesque slogan was “Fix the damn roads,” was elected governor as a moderate who had opposed the Medicare-for-all proposals of her Democratic primary opponents.Warren is not ideally suited to recapturing Michigan.Warren is not as suited to Colorado as is Bennet, who has twice won statewide there.In New Hampshire, where Clinton won by just three-tenths of a point, a recent poll found that whereas 28 percent want “radical change” — Warren’s promise — 57 percent want the country to get “back to normal.” No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Texas since Jimmy Carter in 1976 (barely: with just 51 percent ), and Democrats have not won a statewide race in Texas for a quarter of a century, since 1994.But although the state is acquiring a purple tinge — whites are only about one-third of Texans under 30 — it is not apt to be smitten with Warren in 2020.The state’s 29 electoral votes are within reach, but Warren is not the Democrat most likely to capture them.When reporters reached out to the Harvard College Democrats for Warren for comment on last week’s Democratic debate, the group supporting Sen.

PWNED: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.Warren announced a campaign plan to bring back the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), a congressional research agency that was defunded over two decades ago.Reviving the OTA would help lawmakers and their staff tackle highly complex technology and cybersecurity topics including privacy and encryption instead of relying on lobbyist talking points, Warren said.Congress's lack of tech knowledge became painfully apparent in 2018 hearings over Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, Warren said, noting that "members struggled to engage meaningfully in a conversation about basic technological concepts," let alone "difficult concepts like end-to-end encryption, location tracking and the competitive landscape of Silicon Valley."Yeah," said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in leaked comments promising to fight efforts by Elizabeth Warren to break up his company.The tech industry isn't yet united behind one 2020 candidate, but Democratic candidates with splashy plans such as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and now even Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)And even Warren — whose plan to break up Big Tech is divisive in the Valley — is generating fresh buzz and support from high-profile tech donors.San Jose's The Mercury News reported Biden raised less money from employees at Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple and Google's parent Alphabet than Buttigieg, Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during a three-month period from April to June.While many don't agree with Warren's plans for tech, they're in the industry zeitgeist and it has forced people to take a closer look.“And while I'm incredibly respectful of his career in public service, right now it's candidates like Warren and Buttigieg who I see bringing new ideas and advocating for the evolution of our institutions, not just a return to stability post-Trump.”

Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, responded to Trump’s suggestion that she could win the nomination next year over Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).Earlier Tuesday, Trump had mused that Clinton “should enter the race to try to steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.”

Clinton is currently on a book promotion tour with her daughter and co-author Chelsea Clinton.He suggested that Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, could win the nomination next year over Warren.“I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,” Trump tweeted.“The NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).He offered a meaty history lesson for a president who has never cared much for the discipline, citing Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Nixon and Clinton as he outlined why the House is entitled to records it seeks.(Daily Beast)

-- Warren, facing questions from critics, reiterated that she was fired from her teaching job because she was pregnant.In Warren’s telling, the episode is straightforward and echoes an experience that many other young women had in the 1970s.But some political adversaries seized on a newly surfaced video of Warren telling the story with a different emphasis — in 2007, before she was in elected office — along with freshly uncovered school board documents from the early 1970s to raise doubts about Warren’s account.Republicans also compared the issue to Warren’s past claim that she was Native American, which resulted in her apology last year to tribes ...Yet while the story has played repeatedly on Fox News and conservative outlets, it is not clear the new materials contradict Warren’s recounting of the episode in a material way.… Warren’s campaign accounted for the different explanations by saying she has opened up more about episodes of past discrimination now that she is a public official.Frese allegedly passed additional classified information to one of the woman’s female colleagues at ‘an affiliated but different news outlet.’ … The reporters appear to be Amanda Macias of CNBC and Courtney Kube of MSNBC, both of whom cover national security.”

-- Conservatives claim Elizabeth Warren lied about being pushed out as a teacher because she was pregnant.They wrote of contracts not being renewed after they gave birth, and of positions that were revoked, as Warren says hers was.South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who came out as gay after serving in Afghanistan, spoke of coming out as a ‘civil war.’ … Buttigieg, along with [Kamala] Harris and [Warren], marked the date of the town hall to release their respective agendas on LGBTQ issues.In this special debate day edition: The questions everyone is asking; the candidates left outside the hall; and the polls that explain why everyone not named "Elizabeth Warren” is worried.There will be 12 candidates onstage, but expectations are highest for Biden, Warren and Sanders.The former vice president, who began his campaign by warning against a “circular firing squad,” is increasingly ready to portray Sen. Warren of Massachusetts as a weak candidate.Warren, who has chipped away at Democratic worries about her electability, took more time off than usual before this debate: She has prepped for attacks on everything from Medicare-for-all to her corporate law work to whether she can be trusted to tell her life story.Warren, who as Sanders has fallen back became the main target of Medicare-for-all attacks, has engaged in a long Road Runner-and-Wile E. Coyote game with reporters who keep trying to get her to say whether she'd raise “middle-class taxes” to create universal health care.“Costs are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations, and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down,” Warren said in the interview with Stephen Colbert that perked Democrats (and some reporters) up to the stump-the-candidate possibilities of the question.For Warren's opponents, the dream scenario is simple: a fusillade of private insurance/tax questions that force her either to recycle her talking points or knock her off balance.Does anyone go after Warren's integrity?The third debates began with moderators saying that Warren and Sanders wanted to “replace Obamacare” and Biden didn't want to “scrap it,” exactly the framing that Biden uses on the trail.But over nearly nine hours of debates, no one has challenged Warren on her past claims of Native American heritage.No one has pointed out that she was a Republican until Bill Clinton's second term, though Warren’s allies consider that a general election boost.Warren's campaign has prepped for all of this, and more, including her votes for Trump's first two National Defense Authorization Acts.READING LIST

HEALTH ON THE HILL

When Elizabeth Warren ducked and dodged on Medicare for All Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All in 2020 has proven pivotal.HOUSTON — Elizabeth Warren hadn’t set foot on the University of Houston Law Center campus in nearly 15 years, not since she’d left her first full-time teaching job there.But on a mid-September morning in 1997, Warren, by then a celebrated professor at Harvard Law School, returned to memorialize a man who had played a small but not insignificant role in her teaching career.The five years Warren spent in this sprawling Texas city were among the most transformative of her life.Houston is where Liz Warren became Elizabeth Warren.Now she had been asked to eulogize longtime UH law professor Eugene Smith, who, as head of the faculty hiring committee in 1978, had been an early Warren champion, urging colleagues to look past her limited teaching experience and what some perceived as her second-rate Rutgers Law School degree.Smith, who died of complications from the polio he contracted as a child, had specifically requested that Warren speak at his funeral.With a smile on her face and humor in her voice, Warren described how Smith had invited her to his office one day just a few months after she had been hired.“Everyone was slack-jawed,” recalled John Mixon, a retired UH professor who had been close friends with Smith and Warren.Some wondered whether it was physically possible for Smith to have done what Warren described.While Warren had not shared all the specifics, she had gone to Mixon looking for help when she said Smith came on to her that day in early 1979.And if she tried to get him, she would be the one in the long term to suffer because she would become known as a troublemaker.”

Warren nodded, and as he advised, she said nothing.Warren said nothing until she returned to UH to eulogize a man who had been both a promoter and tormentor, a man who, as she put it in an interview, “no longer had any power over me.”

At Smith’s funeral, Warren told the story in an entertaining way.‘Testing her’

The University of Houston Law Center was in a period of transition when Warren interviewed there in 1978.Warren was almost 29, and she knew the campus.A decade earlier, she had dropped out of college to marry her high school sweetheart, Jim Warren.Elizabeth Warren in 1970 in a University of Houston photo.(UH) (N/A/University of Houston)

Warren earned her law degree from Rutgers just before giving birth to her second child.Gene Smith, who had talked to Warren by phone, met her at the airport, picking her up in his white 1966 Lincoln Continental.In a story that quickly made the rounds among the faculty ― and that Warren later retold at his funeral — Smith ordered a steak, even though his arms were so weak he had trouble cutting it into smaller pieces.The waitress usually helped, but this time, when the steak arrived, Smith pushed the plate over to Warren and ordered her to cut it up for him.Warren just stared at Smith.Everyone at the table laughed, including Smith, who advocated for Warren to be hired.“I knew it from the first minute,” Warren said.As Warren had anticipated, some questioned her academic background.… You knew, just by talking to her, she was going to be successful.”

Warren was hired as an assistant professor, a full-time tenure-track position that included not only legal writing courses but also contracts and commercial law.Warren said she could not remember whether her status as a wife and mother came up in her interviews for the job, but she specifically requested to teach complex financial courses because she thought it might help her be taken more seriously by her colleagues.According to personnel records released by the Warren campaign, her pay that first year was $20,500 — not much more than the $8,000 a semester she had been paid to teach legal writing one night a week at Rutgers.“I was constantly reminded that I didn’t look like a real law professor,” Warren said.If Warren saw herself as a trailblazer for women in law, she has never acknowledged it.Her mother had long warned her, she has said, about becoming “one of those crazy women’s-libbers.” And according to those who knew her at the time, Warren, then a Republican, did not espouse feminist beliefs.But in an interview, Warren recalled being acutely aware of her status as one of the only women on the staff.“It was a lonely experience.”

‘Warren in the making’

For UH law students, Warren was one of their first instructors, teaching contracts, a fundamental course that tends to determine whether a student has a mind for the law.Warren taught in a large lecture hall that resembled an amphitheater.And Warren knew by looking at their faces that she wasn’t connecting with them in the way she wanted.Mixon had won multiple teaching awards, and Warren went to him for advice.Three days a week, after Warren’s contracts class, they would go to lunch at a nearby Mexican restaurant.Some people, especially those cowering in the back, “were scared sh--less of her,” recalled Tracey Conwell, a Houston litigation attorney who took contracts and several other classes with Warren.At one point in the semester, Conwell recalled, a group of her classmates drew up bingo cards with students’ names as they sought to game out Warren’s strategy.One day, Conwell remembered, she and Warren sparred over the philosophical meaning of the word “intent” in contract law, and Warren abruptly cut her off.But the next class, Warren gave Conwell a book: “The Death of Contract,” a controversial 1974 publication that questioned the basis of modern contract law.After that, she said, she and Warren “were buddies.”

“It made clear to me that she was an obviously insightful thinker who had read more than the standard books to arrive at her own concepts about how the law works,” Conwell said.… And that approach, I think, helped her take this really complicated and dreadfully boring stuff and make it really interesting.”

Michael Olivas, a longtime UH law professor who was hired after Warren, recalled sitting in on her classes and being stunned by how good she was.“She was not Elizabeth Warren yet, but she was Elizabeth Warren in the making,” Olivas said.Warren played on a softball team at the UH during the years she taught at the law school.“It just feels the same when you see her on television and she’s trying to explain something and she says, ‘Look, it’s like this,’ or she gets very animated and says, ‘Here’s the thing,’ ” said Rita Lucido, a Houston family-law attorney who took classes with Warren.“I don’t look back and think of contracts as this dry subject, because she made such an effort to keep us engaged with her and to make sure it made sense to us not only from a legal perspective but a real-world perspective.”

Warren was younger and less stuffy than the men on the faculty.Warren also seemed human.Dona Bolding, who was in Warren’s 1979 contracts class, recounted the time she was shopping at Loehmann’s, the discount department store known for its marked-down designer clothing, and ran into Warren standing in her underwear in the store’s communal dressing room.Bolding said she was “mortified.” But Warren instantly made light of the situation.“Oh Miss Bolding,” Warren called out.”

‘The breaking point’

Warren loved her job.But, according to Warren, he was also increasingly a harasser: He commented on her clothes and appearance in ways that made her feel uncomfortable.Warren thought she was managing him until that day in early 1979 when she said he lunged for her in his office.Elizabeth Warren, on Gene Smith

She considered punching him in the face, she said in an interview.And so, when he chased me around his office, I wasn’t afraid of him physically so much as I was afraid of what I knew he could take away from me.”

Warren already instinctively knew silence was her only real option, even before Mixon told her.And that’s what I did.”

As Warren was trying to hang on to her job at UH that first year, her life at home was falling apart.“Child care nearly brought me down,” Warren often says, until her mother’s sister, Bess Reed Veneck, came to Houston from Oklahoma to help out with the kids.Bess Reed Veneck — Aunt Bee — with Warren's children, Alexander and Amelia, circa 1978.(Warren campaign)

But Aunt Bee, as the senator calls her, couldn’t fix what was wrong with Warren’s marriage.By Warren’s telling, she and Jim never really fought.When they were on their high school debate team together, Jim had been drawn to her because she was smart and driven, Warren remembered.“I think we were both shocked by who I turned out to be 10 years later,” Warren said.I kept changing and growing almost despite myself.”

Teaching law, Warren said, “was when the whole world opened up for me.” It was impossible to put her ambitions back into a box and close it away, not even to save her marriage.Elizabeth Warren

One night, Warren recounted in her memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” she asked Jim whether he wanted a divorce.Warren has never said exactly when, though she later wrote in her memoir that “there were reconsiderations and some attempts at one-more-try-to-make-it-work.”

Her family watched the kids that summer as Warren traveled to Florida to attend a conservative law and economics retreat.It’s unclear when the two officially became a couple, but Warren has said she visited him that fall in Connecticut.Warren kisses her husband, Bruce Mann, at an event in Columbia, S.C., in June.(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

Warren filed for divorce from Jim on Nov. 5, 1979.Jim agreed to pay child support that increased by 5 percent a year, as well as contributing to their kids’ college educations, an unusual detail even now, according to Susan Myres, a former Warren student at UH who is now a top divorce attorney in Houston.The agreement, Myres said, reads as if it was written by “a future consumer advocate in the making.”

While Warren has been careful to call her ex-husband “a good man,” she has occasionally hinted at bitterness.While Jim had struggled with Warren’s ambition, Mann embraced it.The two were married in July 1980, shortly after Warren’s 31st birthday, and Mann gave up his tenure-track job and moved to Houston, where UH gave him a one-year teaching contract.Warren was awarded tenure and named assistant dean of the law center.Warren, her second husband and her two children were heading to the University of Texas Law School in Austin, leaving Houston behind.‘A homecoming’

On a hot summer day this past July, Warren walked back through the hallways of UH, the place where it all began for her.She was Elizabeth Warren, the woman running for president.Warren with husband Bruce Mann after addressing the crowd at her reelection victory celebration in Boston in 2018.These results suggest that Warren has broken the “electability ceiling,” writes Philip Bump.… Facebook has been criticized in recent days, including by [Warren], for its ad policy, which exempts politicians from third-party fact-checking and arguably facilitates the spread of disinformation.— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) October 14, 2019

COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren.We're going to -- Senator Warren.LACEY: Senator Warren, we've proposed -- you've proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans' college debt.LACEY: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been, quote, "evasive" about how she's going to pay for Medicare for all.No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.LACEY: Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?LACEY: Senator Warren?Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is, quote, "a good story, except it's not really true."Secretary Castro, what's your response to Senator Warren's claim that automation is a good story, except it's not really true?YANG: Senator Warren, I just need -- I just need to address this.YANG: Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation.BURNETT: Senator Warren, respond, please.BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.(LAUGHTER)

Senator Warren, your response.And right now in America, the top 0.1 percent have so much wealth -- understand this -- that if we put a 2 cent tax on their 50 millionth and first dollar, and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country, age zero to five, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities...

BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.Senator Warren, please respond.YANG: Senator Warren is 100 percent right that we're in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history.And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.And Senator Warren said show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you'll show me your values.(UNKNOWN): Erin, let me say...

BURNETT: I want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.And so I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren.GABBARD: I'd like to ask Senator Warren if she would join me in calling for an end to this regime change war in Syria, finally.COOPER: Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar, Senator Warren -- Senator Warren supports a voluntary -- excuse me, Senator Klobuchar, you support a voluntary buyback, if I'm correct, right.COOPER: Senator Warren, you support a voluntary gun buyback of assault-style weapons, as well.BURNETT: Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term.BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.I'd like to start with Senator Warren...

BURNETT: Sorry, Congressman, I'm sorry.Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google to be broken up.YANG: As usual, Senator Warren is 100 percent right in diagnosing the problem.Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong?STEYER: Look, I agree with Senator Warren that, in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with.Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are.And so, Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account, that you did not agree, and I would urge you to join me.Senator Warren, you can respond.We need campaign finance rules and practices...

Wade?But, you know, Senator Warren said we can't be running any vague campaigns.COOPER: Senator Warren, your response?COOPER: Senator Warren, do you want to respond?But I also don't agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat.Senator Warren, she referenced you, so you can respond.Senator Warren?(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren.Warren (Mass.)South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) took turns criticizing Warren over her support for Medicare-for-all and her purist approach to populism.“Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there’s a better way to deliver coverage for all?”

AD

The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday’s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times.AD

It was the unrelenting onslaught against Warren that most deviated from past gatherings.AD

Former congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas accused Warren of supporting “punitive” tax policy.Businessman Andrew Yang questioned Warren over her plan to break up large technology companies.Unprompted, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) twice roped Warren into her answers, questioning the senator’s foreign policy credentials.“But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.”

The tenor of the debate was the clearest sign yet that Warren’s ascendancy would force her campaign to grapple with the challenges of being the front-runner in a large and unwieldy Democratic field.AD

AD

Warren fought back against the attacks, casting her challengers as too small-minded or timid for the moment, or as part of an entrenched political system that is dominated by corporations and the wealthy.“Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,” Warren said.AD

“Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except for this,” Buttigieg said, facing Warren, as he accused her of giving an evasive answer when asked if Medicare-for-all would lead to tax increases for Americans.“And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

AD

But Klobuchar also challenged Warren’s approach more broadly.More than once, she told Warren that her idea is “not the only idea,” suggesting that Warren’s approach was both inflexible and impractical.AD

Warren insisted that overall costs for the middle class would go down under her plan, while corporations and the wealthy would pay more.Seven of Warren’s 11 Democratic rivals onstage Tuesday night in Ohio directly criticized her at least once.“Sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up,” said Beto O’Rourke, criticizing her wealth tax.“Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation, and they’re smart,” said Yang.That left Warren to feel the heat that comes with being considered a front-runner.-- Warren dominated the conversation.Partly this is because Warren, once the Oklahoma state champion in high school debate, would never let the moderators cut her off and finished every point she wanted to make.-- In the short term, the pile-on helps Warren.Warren looked big while the others, in some cases desperate to secure a spot in the next debate, collectively looked small.“I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,” Warren said.-- Warren’s rivals seemed determined to undercut her brand as a teller of hard truths by repeatedly calling out her steadfast unwillingness to acknowledge that taxes will inevitably go up for the middle class under her Medicare-for-all plan.Except this!”

Warren is sensitive to being lumped in with the Beltway set.But she also showed she’s no wilting lily: Responding to Buttigieg, she described his “Medicare for all who want it” proposal as “Medicare for all who can afford it.”

“I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,” Warren promised.Warren’s perceived holier-than-thou ethos – derived from an apparent conviction that she’s purer than other politicians – genuinely grates on several of her rivals and fellow senators.Your idea is not the only idea,” Klobuchar told Warren during the discussion about wealth.Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.”

-- In the longer term, besides fears that she’s too liberal to beat Trump, the debate highlighted two other reasons that Democratic pooh-bahs continue to express varying degrees of concerns about Warren’s electability: her lack of national security experience and tangible achievements in Congress.Warren spoke less during the foreign policy round than any other part of the debate.But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.”

As she geared up for a presidential run a few years ago, Warren maneuvered to secure a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee – something she noted on Tuesday.Warren responded that she helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before coming to the Senate.Warren replied that she’s “deeply grateful” to Barack Obama for making sure the agency was included in the final version of Dodd-Frank.-- Reflecting her status, even Yang swiped at Warren on three separate issues.He also said Warren’s wealth tax idea has been tried – and then abandoned – in Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden.Yang is obviously not a real threat to her, but Warren – eager to show she’s a fighter – still took the time to say that her plan to expand Social Security benefits would do more to help people than Yang’s plan to give every American a universal basic income with a $1,000-per-month check.That wasn’t the only time Warren sought to signal to Democratic voters that she’s a counterpuncher who won’t look the other way when Trump attacks.“I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,” Warren said.-- Warren easily defused a moderator’s question about her age – she’s a very energetic 70 – with a laugh line that hinted Trump might not be the GOP standard-bearer next year.When Cory Booker pointed out that Sanders favors legalizing marijuana, Sanders deadpanned: “I'm not on it tonight.”

INDIANOLA, Iowa — After weeks of speculation, it took Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts just a minute to promise something new: a plan to pay for Medicare-for-all.“They’re attacking Democratic values,” grumbled Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, about Warren's more moderate primary opponents.In Indianola and at other stops, Warren has been peppered with questions about how she'd pay for her biggest plan and why she didn't have a quicker answer.“There are many estimates,” said Warren, “about what the cost will be.”

Some on the left want to go further and question why Washington is so bound to cost estimates.Warren seemed to have cracked the code, deflecting charges that she would dole out “free stuff” without paying for it and with so much of that stuff that even she sounded surprised.“Plus, if you sign up now, 12 steak knives!” Warren joked at an appearance in Nevada.The wealth tax never covered Medicare-for-all, though, which led to the questions about how Warren could pay for it.The risk to Democrats criticizing Warren's plans to pay for health care was that they could face questions about their own plans.South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who had also accused Warren of evasiveness, was pressed on how his “Medicare for all who want it” plan would be paid for and quickly proposed raising corporate tax rates back to 35 percent — a level even some Democrats had thought was too high before Trump took office.Warren is, telling reporters in Indianola that the pay-fors had been in the making “for a long time” and needed “a little more work.” The campaign is tight-lipped about what they might be.“Elizabeth Warren calls for billions of new dollars to reform pre-K-12 schools and fight privatization.2020 presidential election in Florida (UNF, 643 registered voters)

Ask reporters who have been out on the campaign trail this year, and they’ll tell you that Warren’s rise has not surprised them because, from the beginning, she has been the candidate who seemed to excite voters the most.About 1 in 5 said they’d be disappointed if it were Joe Biden or Sen. Bernie Sanders, while the lowest numbers were for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (10 percent) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (13 percent).Even for Warren, whose candidacy only 1 in 10 Democrats would be disappointed with, only about half are confident she would win.Speaking of Iowa, an online Iowa State-Civiqs poll has Sen.

The race for a single-payer pay-for.Sometime before the next Democratic presidential debate, Elizabeth Warren will explain how to fund Medicare-for-all, as laid out in the Senate legislation she’s supported since 2017.Warren’s situation, and political theory, is different, and she’s now getting advice on how to make the numbers work.In the American Prospect, Jon Walker argued that Warren could promise to cap all health-care prices, down to the levels seen in countries that have single-payer systems.Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the sponsor of the House’s Medicare-for-all bill, said in an interview that Warren had found a “better way to answer the question” about the costs – precisely because she refused to talk about taxes.That’s not how you do it, until you actually have the final piece of legislation.”

Jayapal, who is among those who have talked to Warren’s campaign about the cost of Medicare-for-all, suggested that it was possible to answer the killer question – would she raise taxes on the middle class?This is the first time that number has dropped for Warren, and it's the only real evidence her of post-debate slippage, after several center-left candidates attacked her for not explaining how Medicare-for-all could be paid for.But the state's Democrats look ready to repeat their recent pattern of backing a more liberal candidate: The combined vote for Warren and Sanders outpaces the vote for Biden by 10 points.Massachusetts Democratic primary (WBUR/MassINC, 456 registered voters)

Warren insisted that the chants stop.“I understand Donald Trump, and his supporters are getting really nervous,” Warren said.Afterward, Warren told reporters that she tried to tamp down the chants because she did not agree with the sentiment.“We have an ongoing impeachment proceeding right now in Washington that is a serious constitutional undertaking, and we need to treat it with seriousness,” Warren said.In a video, Warren said that “if Israel’s government continues with steps to formally annex the West Bank, the U.S. should make clear that none of our aid should be used to support annexation,” expanding on remarks she’d made to reporters and the activist group IfNotNow.Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Klobuchar have seen positive trends, of different kinds; almost nothing good has been happening for Biden.He continues to lag behind Warren and Sanders among voters naming their second choice, which has been true for a while and which remains worrying for a race that will take place after Iowa shrinks the field.Both Warren and Sanders are viewed by more voters as the most “likable,” with Sanders up seven points (to 27 percent) and Warren up six (to 10 percent) — they've both gained on that question all year.Elizabeth Warren.But the machine-learning app SmartNews has continued tracking post-debate interest in candidates, and in the wake of the fourth debate, it has found movement for both Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg.The only candidate with steady growth is Warren, the focus of 602,000 views in the week of the June debates and 1.4 million page views in the same period of October.Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)It also found Sanders refusing to engage on the question occupying Warren's campaign: how to pay for every dollar of Medicare-for-all's estimated cost.At the end of the day, we will pay for every nickel of Medicare-for-all, and it will save the overwhelming majority of the American people, who will no longer pay premiums.”

It's not altogether different from answers Warren has given, and it's emblematic of how the conversation has shifted on Medicare-for-all and the primary.At the moment, Sanders's opponents are fine with that — because they're more nervous about Warren.With Sanders refusing to take the “how will you pay for it” bait, and Warren's plan not yet ready, their critics have found an opening.They're unlikely to be part of any Warren plan, but in the short term, they fill gaps in the political conversation.Warren's supporters are trying to set up a soft landing for whatever she releases.The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has been closely aligned with Warren since the effort to draft her into Massachusetts's 2012 Senate race, presented polling at this past weekend's Congressional Progressive Caucus designed to show that voters would support Medicare-for-all if they believed it was paid for with taxes lower than their current premiums.Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)Senator Warren is producing plans to pay for Medicare-for-all.John Harwood: You think it’s foolish that Senator Warren is trying to?… Sen.

Greene said he finds Warren’s choice of former Teach for America corps member Joshua Delaney as education policy adviser to be “concerning.” Teach for America, which places college graduates into high-needs classrooms with only five weeks of summer training, became popular with the Obama administration and wealthy philanthropists.Greene wrote: “If her idea to appoint a secretary of education who has taught in a public school classroom includes consideration of TFA products who taught for just two years, traditional public school teachers are unlikely to be impressed.”

Meanwhile, public education advocates say they are waiting for Warren to put forth her K-12 improvement vision.In sum, as improbable as it might seem, next to Warren (who’s running a near-perfect campaign) Buttigieg might have the most effective campaign operation and message.Zuckerberg predicted that Facebook will sue the U.S. government to prevent it from being broken up, calling antitrust threats “existential.” He responded to a proposal from Sen.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.In Warren’s telling, the episode is straightforward and echoes an experience that many other young women had in the 1970s.But some political adversaries seized on a newly surfaced video of Warren telling the story with a different emphasis — in 2007, before she was in elected office — along with freshly uncovered school board documents from the early 1970s to raise doubts about Warren’s account.Republicans also compared the issue to Warren’s past claim that she was Native American, which resulted in her apology last year to tribes, which themselves determine their membership.It sure sounded good when Warren told that story but maybe it was like her ancestry – too good to be true and offered up to advance her cause,” Republican strategist Karl Rove said on Twitter.AD

Yet while the story has played repeatedly on Fox News and conservative outlets, it is not clear the new materials contradict Warren’s recounting of the episode in a material way.In the March 2007 interview, which was posted on social media last week by a writer for the leftist Jacobin Magazine, Warren stressed that to keep teaching she would have had to do additional graduate school work because she didn’t have proper certification to stay on.“I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, ‘I don’t think this is going to work out for me,’ ” Warren said in the interview with an official at the University of California at Berkeley.AD

AD

Warren does not mention the certification issue while campaigning, focusing on being shown the door when school officials realized she was pregnant.Warren’s campaign accounted for the different explanations by saying she has opened up more about episodes of past discrimination now that she is a public official.On Monday, the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative site, published minutes from Riverdale Board of Education meetings from 1970 and 1971 that showed Warren was initially hired to teach part time in August 1970 and then rehired for a second year in April 1971, when she was about five months pregnant.AD

The records also show that two months later, in June 1971, Warren resigned from the teaching position.AD

Warren said the job offer for the second year was rescinded once she was visibly pregnant.But two former teachers who worked at Riverdale elementary school at the same time as Warren, first interviewed by CBS News, told The Washington Post that non-tenured pregnant teachers like Warren could be fired without cause.Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)Warren is pitching a $3 trillion clean energy plan that involves creating a “Green Marshall Plan” to encourage foreigners to buy U.S.-made green technologies.The only one of the three to openly support an end to the filibuster is Warren.But when it comes to the 2020 presidential race, many progressives are torn between Sanders and Warren.AD

A stock-market meltdown stemming from Elizabeth Warren's victory in the 2020 election will likely be short-lived, RBC says Some investors and analysts are growing increasingly concerned about the prospect of Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren taking the White House in 2020.That was more than self-funding billionaire Steyer, more than hard-charging Warren — more than anyone else other than Trump.For the first time, RealClearPolitics gives Warren the lead in the Democratic contest.Will Warren hold on?Happily, we have similar RealClearPolitics averages for each contest since 2008, allowing us to compare past surges with Warren’s.Here’s what Warren’s recent surge into the lead looks like relative to next year’s general election.Warren’s recent polling looks more like Trump’s July surge or McCain’s in January 2008 than Huckabee’s or Carson’s.Businessman Herman Cain saw a surge that was slightly faster than Warren’s, and which flatlined soon after he took the lead.This may be the only scenario in which Warren would like to emulate Trump, seizing a lead that she holds essentially uncontested through the rest of the primaries.Sen.

Warren’s supporters say her acerbic tone Thursday was appropriate, given that it was aimed at people who want to deny gays and lesbians the fundamental right to marry.Several Democrats noted that support for same-sex marriage has grown quickly in the United States, putting Warren’s views in line with those of many voters.And those who do not, Warren’s supporters say, would be unlikely to support her in any case.AD

Still, one issue for Warren could be how such comments play with black voters, some of whom are socially conservative.Warren probably will need to appeal to African Americans to secure the Democratic nomination and win the White House, but has so far made few inroads with the black community.AD

Older and more religious black voters in particular may be less likely to find Warren’s joke funny, several strategists said.“I’m especially not sure what discussions might carry over to the barbershops this weekend.”

Warren, a policy polymath, has a plan for everything, including for taxing speech that annoys her.Warren proposes steep taxes (up to 75 percent) on “excessive” lobbying expenditures, as though the amendment says Congress can forbid “excessive” petitioning.Warren, who like O’Rourke is operatic when denouncing President Trump’s ignorance of, or hostility to, constitutional norms, might not be a plausible person to make the case against him.Unfortunately, however, O’Rourke, Warren and Silver demonstrate the tendency of too many progressives to cut constitutional corners, to despise and bully adversaries, and to practice theatrical but selective indignation about attacks on fundamental American principles, some of which they themselves traduce.THE TICKER

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)Warren took incoming on a number of fronts, including her support for Medicare for all, her call for breaking up tech giants, and her foreign policy credentials.On the debate stage, some of Warren’s competitors took aim at it as practically unworkable or too politically polarizing.“Sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions,” former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Tex.)Warren sought to change the tenor of the debate over the wealth tax: “My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax,” Warren said, nodding to the fact that Sanders has introduced a wealth tax of his own.And Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) fired back that Warren needed a “reality check” because “no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires.”

Warren on the campaign trail has emphasized that her levy would raise an estimated $2.75 trillion from roughly 75,000 families.But on the debate stage, Warren said she was “really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive.”

“Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires,” said Warren, who describes herself as a “capitalist to my bones.”

“My problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you,” she continued.And all I'm saying is, you make it to the top, the top 0.1 percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.”

— Warren pledges to turn down money from Wall Street and tech execs: Warren "took another stance against Big Tech and Wall Street firms ... by pledging to turn down large contributions from their executives," CNBC's Lauren Feiner and Tucker Higgins reports."Warren announced on her campaign website that she will decline contributions over $200 from executives at Big Tech companies, large banks, private equity firms or hedge funds.After previously pledging not to take large contributions from pharmaceutical executives, Warren’s announcement on Tuesday expanded the umbrella of forbidden donors."Survey finds investors predict Warren will be the nominee: "An Evercore ISI survey on "-- more than three months before the Iowa caucuses in February -- found 70% of investors believe Senator Elizabeth Warren will win the Democratic party’s nomination for president," Bloomberg's Felice Maranz reports.Warren declared, “So look, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East.” That sort of isolationist view, especially in light of President Trump’s Syria debacle, raises real questions about her judgment.Shortly after the debate, spokesperson Alexis Krieg put out a statement trying to clarify Warren’s comment.How does Warren think diplomacy works if we announce in advance that all troops are leaving?Warren will be accused of disregarding, just as Trump has, the potential for the Islamic State to reemerge as a threat to Europe and our own homeland.Warren should put aside the platitudes and spend as much time thinking about foreign policy as she does domestic policy.In response to growing inequality and the leftward drift of the party, left-leaning economists have increasingly pushed a wealth tax that would, at least in the case of Sanders’s proposal, substantially reduce the fortunes of multibillionaires such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.AD

The dispute sparked spirited exchanges Tuesday night, as Warren responded to criticisms of the wealth tax by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) by asking, “Why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?”

Joe Biden, the former vice president who has stopped short of calling for a wealth tax but is seeking higher taxes on wealthy investors, quickly interjected: “No one is supporting billionaires.”

AD

Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes on millionaires and eliminating a loophole that allows heirs to receive capital gains tax-free, according to his campaign, but has not embraced measures that would raise as much money as the wealth tax pitched by Sanders and Warren.Warren’s plan calls for levying a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million, as well as a 3 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion.Warren said she would use that money to implement a universal child-care program, tuition-free public colleges and universities, and student debt elimination for most borrowers.The debate over the wealth tax played out along familiar lines at the fourth debate, as other rivals of Sanders and Warren sought to distance themselves from the idea.Klobuchar said that Warren needed a “reality check” and that, “We just have different approaches: Your idea is not the only idea.”

The endorsements surprised many top Democrats who wondered whether they would throw their support to Warren, who is also running as a champion of liberal ideas, or stay neutral.For years during the 1980s, RFK Stadium was the site of an annual five-inning game called the “Cracker Jack Old Timers Baseball Classic” that featured Sandy Koufax (one batter faced), Bob Feller, Whitey Ford, Roger Maris, Warren Spahn and Joe DiMaggio.Conservatives don’t want to give aid and comfort to the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, do they?Warren, who in some recent polls has topped the other 18 candidates running for the Democratic nomination, would steer U.S. education policy away from that of President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who have said their priority is expanding alternatives to traditional public schools.AD

“To keep our traditional public school systems strong, we must resist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools,” Warren said in the plan.She pointed to charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated (and which Warren once supported), and to DeVos-backed voucher and tuition tax-credit programs that use public money for private and religious school education.Warren, who has touted dozens of plans for the country, said she would pay for her education vision with a proposed “wealth tax.” It would levy a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million and a 3 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion.Some economists and other Democratic candidates have said the tax would not raise as much as Warren said it would and could not pay for everything she plans.AD

A representative of the Warren campaign said Sunday that Warren would use the wealth tax to pay for the new education plan as well as for previously announced initiatives to provide universal child care and early learning opportunities, cancel most student college debt and offer free tuition at public colleges.AD

And now, the representative said, other plans Warren had intended to use the wealth tax to cover — to end the opioid crisis, to create a small-business equity fund, and to invest in election security and administration — will be funded by closing the “stepped-up basis” loophole on the tax on inherited assets.Warren says that move will raise more than $100 billion over 10 years.It is unclear whether her funding proposals will cover the more than $1 trillion in initiatives that Warren has advanced for pre-K through college.But Warren has staked out a vision for pre-K through 12th grade that is at least as expansive as any other candidate’s in the Democratic race.Warren said she wants to change that formula and work toward an equitable funding system as she pours more money into schools in high-poverty neighborhoods.Warren’s plan takes aim at some of the most systemic problems in education, including segregated classrooms and neighborhoods and low teacher pay.It recognizes that student achievement is affected by factors outside the classroom and calls for changing policies on housing, energy and broadband availability that Warren said affect the ability of students to get a quality education.Warren also supports making school districts the only authorizers of charter schools and promises to “crack down on union-busting and discriminatory enrollment, suspension, and expulsion practices in charter schools.”

Reinstate Obama-era protections for transgender students under federal law that were revoked by Trump and take other steps to protect LGBTQ students and faculty.Kevin Welner, director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder and a professor specializing in educational policy and law, said Warren’s plan is “designed to move away from the baseless schemes grounded in test-based accountability and school choice, shifting to long-term, sustainable investment that would genuinely increase kids’ learning opportunities.”

An Elizabeth Warren administration would use its regulatory power to implement a flood of market-rattling moves on everything from antitrust enforcement to raising worker pay.That’s the conclusion two former executive branch economic hands reach in a new report on what Warren winning the White House would mean for corporate America.But as Warren said at the last debate, “I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it.”

The resulting regulatory bonanza, Bianchi and Tedeschi argue, would reach into just about every corner of the economy.“All any President needs is to have an effective group of Administration officials in place with a clear agenda — which Warren certainly provides,” they write.We’ve written here about the difficulty Warren could face getting nominees confirmed by a GOP Senate.Here’s a look at some of the actions a President Warren could take, per the Evercore ISI report.A Warren administration could juice investigations the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched into big tech companies — and push to break up Amazon, Facebook and Google, Bianchi and Tedeschi write (Warren has made no secret of her desire to break up large tech companies like Facebook).“But there is no doubt that a Warren Administration would make corporate America think twice before proposing many mergers.” (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)“Warren gave a speech in 2016 where she outlined her views about the concentration throughout the economy, including aspects of the health care sector, agriculture, and beyond,” the report says, noting Warren was critical of the Obama administration for not being more aggressive on this front.Though Warren wants to break up the big banks by restoring the Glass Steagall Act, the proposal stands little chance of moving on the Hill.But Bianchi and Tedeschi point to several other pressure points a President Warren could target through executive authority.Warren has been a tough critic of Beijing and would likely confront the regime on a number of issues.“We think Senator Warren could be tougher particularly around issues such as labor, environmental rights, including Climate Change,” Bianchi and Tedeschi write.“Moreover, we think that she is trying to ‘out tough’ Trump on China given the political benefits of doing so, particularly in the Midwest.”

They argue Warren would speak out where Trump hasn’t, on human rights issues generally and the protests in Hong Kong specifically.Warren can’t achieve her ambition of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by executive fiat.“One of Warren’s main messages is that a central reason for the high levels of wealth disparity in the United States is due to a lack of accountability for those at the top – whether it is the top of the income scale or corporations,” Bianchi and Tedeschi write.Some of Warren’s more ambitious regulatory efforts could get knocked down in the courts.But the Evercore pair note that Warren made her biggest mark on policy before arriving in the Senate in 2013 — by standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.MONEY ON THE HILL

Warren.The industry has come in for some harsh criticism from Democrats — particularly from Warren, who has called the firms “vampires” that are “looting” the economy and pitched a plan one economist said would ”be the end of private equity as we know it.” Now the sector is fighting back, ramping up a campaign to convince voters and policymakers that the business model supports jobs and economic growth.Lobbyists say they can work with Warren.Politico's Theodoric Meyer: "Even in a Democratic presidential field in which most candidates have sworn off contributions from lobbyists, Warren’s hostility to K Street stands out.But while Warren’s campaign rhetoric has made the influence industry nervous, many lobbyists who’ve worked with the Massachusetts senator’s office say she’s far from antagonistic when it comes to doing business with K Street.It’s a centerpiece of his campaign, positioning himself against the more far-reaching ‘Medicare for All’ plan by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, which would put all Americans in Medicare.”

— Energy investors balk at Warren what-if: Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.)Although banning hydraulic fracturing would have numerous hurdles, industry players have taken it seriously and are considering what a Warren win would mean for them, the Wall Street Journal reports.“Cowen Inc. analyst David Deckelbaum said that ‘coincidentally or not’ since Ms. Warren’s tweet, shares of five exploration and production companies that he studies with significant operations on federal land — including Devon, Concho and Occidental Petroleum Corp. — have underperformed by 5% those of companies he tracks that don’t drill much on federal property,” per the report.During a debate among the Democratic candidates for the 2020 election last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)Though many Democrats are skeptical of U.S. intervention in the Middle East, Warren’s comments were unusually forthright.Warren, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee and is the leading candidate in recent polls, has stated she would pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan before a peace deal is reached.Warren’s campaign tried to clarify the candidate’s remarks in a subsequent statement that said she “was referencing combat troops, not those stationed in the Middle East in noncombat roles.” Spokeswoman Alexis Krieg added that Warren “believes we need to end the endless wars” and wanted to “responsibly remove U.S. troops from combat in the Middle East.”

The explanation belied the complexities of the U.S. presence in the Middle East.AD

AD

It is not clear if Warren’s standard would apply to the 5,200 troops in Iraq who support Iraqi security services but do not engage in direct conflict, the 1,000 troops in Syria who supported the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces or even the 1,800 troops heading to Saudi Arabia to help deter Iran and its proxies.Before Trump and Warren, President Barack Obama had his own ideas about bringing troops home.(Two other polls released today have Biden at 27 percent, leading Warren by six points in one and eight points in the other.)One nugget from CNN’s poll should encourage Biden: "Biden and Sanders do their best in the primary among voters who say they are certain of their vote choice, while Warren voters are much more likely to say they may change their mind.”

[She] said she is 'concerned' about that issue and whether Wall Street institutions will try to assert that liquidity regulations imposed after the financial crisis are too strict and interfering with lending market functions."This has limited the Warren campaign’s options for finding additional sources of revenue without affecting middle-class Americans.AD

Bharat Ramamurti, a longtime Warren aide who served on the Senate Banking Committee, is widely seen as spearheading the single-payer financing plan for the campaign, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.While other candidates have sought ambiguity, Warren has prided herself on the granularity of her ideas.Warren, who opposed single-payer in her 2012 Senate run, said her Medicare-for-all financing plan has been “months and months” in the making.AD

Several ideas have surfaced as Warren faces the high-stakes decision.Pollin refused to discuss any details related to his conversations with Warren’s campaign.Under this idea, Warren would propose raising revenue for a Medicare-for-all fund from a premium charge that would go to the government rather than a private insurance company.“That would neutralize the word ‘tax’ because it would remind people that a tax is a synonym for a premium, and then at that point you are quibbling over words.”

AD

Warren’s team has also received recommendations to adopt a “progressive consumption tax” to help fund the proposal, according to a person with knowledge of the suggestion and spoke on the condition of anonymity.A fourth idea that has been suggested is for Warren to sell her Medicare-for-all plan as a tax cut, by comparing how much families save by having their health-care costs lowered, according to another independent economic adviser to the Warren campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.AD

It is unclear if any of these proposals is likely to ultimately be proposed by Warren’s campaign.AD

Warren has risen in the polls over the past several months but has faced attacks from her rivals over her position on Medicare-for-all.Warren told a local television anchor during her 2012 Senate campaign that she does not support single-payer, according to remarks recently reported by Politico.At one presidential debate, Warren said she is “with Bernie” on the issue.Warren’s more centrist rivals have attacked her for not acknowledging single-payer would lead to middle-class tax hikes, with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., calling her position on the question “extremely evasive.”

But the public appetite for dramatic action on health care may be strong.And that may mean voters are willing to accept the trade-offs of a Medicare-for-all model, should Warren be able to convince them it will ultimately help their bottom line.The result is that both Biden and Warren are leading Trump among women overall in these battlegrounds by 56-37 and 54-36 respectively.AD

One interesting point about this is that Biden doesn’t do appreciably better than Warren does among these subgroups of men, which is a bit of a surprise.AD

AD

Before we try to answer that question, we’ll note that the difference between Biden and Warren in the two polls was represented across a range of demographic groups.Quinnipiac’s “very liberal” respondents gave Warren a massive edge.You’ll notice that the Warren result in each poll — 28 percent in Quinnipiac and 19 in CNN’s — is less significant than it might seem.The bottom of the Quinnipiac bar is lower than the top of the CNN bar, meaning that perhaps Warren’s real support, so to speak, was around 24 percent and, therefore, within each poll’s margin of error.Our average (which includes both the Quinnipiac and CNN polls) has Warren performing about as well as Quinnipiac’s poll but Biden somewhere in the middle of the two new results.Quinnipiac also shows a downturn for Warren, matching RCP, but CNN’s support for Warren is closer to the average value.Beyond that, MarketWatch reports, “Sanders proposes a variety of progressive tax changes, including imposing a marginal tax rate of up to 70% on those making above $10 million, taxing earned and unearned income at the same rates, limiting tax deductions for filers in the top tax bracket, establishing a tax on extreme wealth and making the estate tax more progressive, including a 77% top rate on an inheritance above $1 billion.”

AD

AD

The tricky part here is that Warren has promised that “costs” for the middle class will not go up and she has already put out a wealth tax to pay for all her other programs (e.g.The analysis shows that 71 percent of households with private insurance today would pay more in new taxes than they would save through the elimination of premiums and cost sharing.” And remember, Warren has already ruled out applying those taxes to middle-class Americans if it means their total cost goes up.Now, Warren prides herself on a plan “for everything” and for paying for everything, so I look forward to seeing her math.If single-payer didn’t work in Vermont and if foreign countries’ health plans are less generous and/or require some co-pays, Warren has her work cut out for her.or region-specific (Sen.

The cat is out of the bag.Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)Several Democratic candidates cite national security explicitly, including Warren, who has a position paper specifically on the issue.Here’s some unsolicited advice for all from someone — that would be me — who likes both Sanders and Warren: Stop this argument, now.Sanders calls for a “political revolution,” while Warren refers to herself as a “capitalist.” Sanders possesses a talent for pitching transformative policy in a simple way.Warren offers a sophisticated understanding of how the regulatory process has been manipulated by powerful interests, and she has an ability to explain that fact compellingly to a degree almost unheard of in a major national candidate.But when it comes to Warren, there is something else at work.Warren got her start as a teacher, and that influences how she convinces others to this day.As Warren told New York magazine’s Rebecca Traister, teaching is “fundamentally about figuring out where the student is and how far I can bring them from where they are.” In other words, she reels people in slowly, step by persuasive step.While many appear to lazily assume the current Warren and Sanders supporters are interchangeable, that’s just not so.Polls show Warren’s support skews older, whiter, female and more highly educated.In other words, is not a given that Sanders and Warren voters will magically accrue to the other if one or the other drops out now.Both Warren and Sanders appear capable of leading a movement for change.Families on the front lines of the climate crisis need action now.”

E&E News: Senate climate vote seen as Democrats’ road map

USA Today: Tom Steyer has been pushing impeachment for years.Below I describe the big climate ideas from the top three candidates in the polls: Former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)Warren, who has released smaller plans rather than one climate policy, has endorsed scientists’ and the Green New Deal’s targets.Warren has committed to regulating and limiting it.They have also promised to commit money to deploying technologies: Warren at $1.5 trillion and Biden at $1.3 trillion.[34] In an article supporting passage of such a law, retired chief justice Warren E. Burger wrote:

Americans also have a right to defend their homes, and we need not challenge that.Most of the Democrats insisted that dirty industries could be forced to innovate, even when they kicked and screamed; both Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)“They developed the catalytic converter and, lo and behold, they cut emissions,” Warren said of car companies.“Like, if you don’t gulp it down immediately it starts to bend, and then, you know the little thing catches it, and you know, we’ve got to kind of perfect that one a little bit more.”

Later, Warren rejected the premise.Sanders had agreed with a questioner who wanted to allow U.S. aid to flow again to family planning and abortion services; an RNC statement accused him of endorsing “population control, including unlimited abortions.” Warren had favored personal choices to avoid climate-unfriendly products; the RNC accused her of wanting “the government to control which lightbulbs you use, which straws you use, and limit your cheeseburger consumption.”

Climate activists got the fight they wanted but were perpetually in danger of losing the accompanying fight over culture.In September, a tighter framing of the question finds something increasingly familiar in this primary: A combined but divided vote for the left-wing candidates (Elizabeth Warren and Sanders) that's larger than the vote for the “moderate lane” candidates, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg.In this poll, Sanders leads with 34 percent in the city of Milwaukee, with Biden trailing at 31 percent and Warren far behind at 6 percent.This isn’t even clear, because he’s less populist than Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.Mr. Sanders has gone the farthest, urging Democrats to support a “full fracking ban” — a call that Ms. Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also embraced.Warren telling moderator Chris Cuomo, whose soapy, cheap demeanor is perfect for the end-of-days, “Oh, come on, give me a break!” when he pressed her on whether the government should really be in the business of regulating Big Lightbulb.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)These are the college-educated voters, mostly white, who wish they had a professor like Warren back in the day.They don’t worry that Trump will bully Warren.For Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is spending gobs of time in South Carolina and assiduously courting Biden’s middle-aged church lady, the key will be siphoning off Biden voters and picking off voters queasy about Sanders or Warren but who think Biden is just “blah.” She perhaps stands to gain the most if Biden falters.He’s going for the voters who like rational, low-key government and cannot wrap their heads around the idea of someone as progressive as Sanders or Warren beating Trump.Both liked Sen. Elizabeth Warren and were curious about Sen. Kamala Harris.Most significantly, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts explicitly adopted parts of Inslee's lengthy climate plan as her own on the eve of the debate, including a 10-year plan to eliminate heat-trapping emissions from power plants, vehicles and buildings, as well as an additional $1 trillion in spending to make that move.“He said, 'Have at them,' " Warren said of Inslee's plans.Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)AD

“Oh, come on,” replied Warren, who’s running in the Democratic presidential primary.And I’m going to help, and I’m going to support.”

Fossil fuel companies probably aren’t exactly disappointed that the discussion over the Green New Deal has centered on nonsensical claims that hamburgers will be banned, but, contrary to what Warren claims, companies aren’t really driving it, either.“It is difficult to drink out of a paper straw.”

“Do you think that the government should be in the business of telling you what kind of lightbulb you could have?” Cuomo asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).“Oh, come on, give me a break,” Warren said, attempting to stomp out the whole government-in-my-pantry discussion sometime during Hour 5.Warren urged people not to be distracted by smaller debates:

Sen. Elizabeth Warren says conversations around regulating lightbulbs, banning plastic straws and cutting down on red meat are what the fossil fuel industry wants people focused on as a way to distract from their impact on climate change.That time is far better spent trying to get Warren and Biden to engage with each other on economic issues, or to see Klobuchar spar with Bernie Sanders over whether far-left idealism or liberal pragmatism is the future of the party.For many voters tired of the same old politicians (and I do mean old — at 70, Warren is the youngest of the top three), these may be the most interesting candidates.Elizabeth Warren — 2.While Buttigieg’s pitch is a direct criticism of President Trump, it also comes as several rivals with liberal records, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)Or if you put Elizabeth Warren in a white evangelical Christian home in rural Tennessee?If they’re looking for change — which really won’t be much quieter than what we have now — then it’s Elizabeth Warren,” said Howard Cunningham, a New Hampshire delegate.Warren, who has struggled with a notion in the minds of many voters that she won’t be able to beat President Trump, tried to harness the affection that voters are showering on her and use that as an argument that she should lead the party.Anybody in here want to win in 2020?” Warren asked.You built this country,” Biden said, offering a riff similar to one that Warren first gave during her 2012 Senate campaign.AD

AD

He has echoed that message on the trail in recent weeks, refining his vague “Win the Era” slogan to an argument meant to more firmly position him as a next-generation change agent, with center-left policy views like Biden and an urgency to shake up the system more reminiscent of Warren and Sanders, the liberal disrupters in the race.Another 225 people squeezed into a ballroom at the Hotel Ottumwa in Ottumwa, a popular destination for Democratic hopefuls lately where Warren attracted about the same sized crowd during a visit in May.AD

But he is playing catch-up to rivals like Warren, who has had staffers deeply embedded in many communities for months in an attempt to forge their own personal connections.“If we really want to win, we have to present a different kind of message.”

With the exception of Warren and Sanders, who are competitive with Biden in New Hampshire, most of the Democratic field is waiting for Biden's voters to migrate away from him and discover their options.“We have to win the presidency, yes, but to do the big things that we need to do when it comes to climate and health care and gun safety, we also need to win the Senate.”

On Saturday, Warren and Sanders sometimes appeared to be running in a different primary altogether.“The last poll, I believe, had us up by 12 points.”

CBS's massive survey of early states has found tight contests in three of the first four voting states, with only South Carolina dominated by one candidate: That's Joe Biden, who laps the field in support from black voters.The result is more evidence of a three-candidate pileup, with Warren and Sanders both running ahead of Biden on issues.Elizabeth Warren.“We have a country that is working great for the wealthy and leaving everybody else behind,” Warren said."We have a country where our economy, our democracy, our government are working for those with money and not so much for anyone else.”

“So I grew up out in Oklahoma in a paycheck-to-paycheck family,” Warren continued.Warren certainly can rouse the crowd, telling people, “This is our moment to dream big and fight hard!” But she also tells a story and has a conversation with her audience.Warren didn’t mention Trump’s name.AD

Perhaps in a preview of the debate this Thursday, Warren cautioned the crowd, “There is a lot at stake, and people are scared.We win when we call out what is broken, when we show how to fix it, and when we build a grass-roots movement to get it done.”

Warren did not directly answer the question, a tactic she continues to employ, saying the real solution is an economy where Americans are doing better.“We need fewer families to need to turn to the bankruptcy system,” Warren said, pointing to health-care costs as a major factor.Warren was tapped by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) to come to Washington to help keep watch over the distribution of bailout money, ultimately becoming a resource for the Obama team rather than an adversary.“At that point, it’s clear that Elizabeth Warren really knows what she’s talking about regarding what happened and that her vision of the appropriate guardrails needed was a smart one,” Bernstein said.“I think they had a lot of shared perspective in terms of focusing on getting the economy back on track.”

Still, some Warren allies play down Biden’s role in winning passage of the Dodd-Frank law, the sweeping bank overhaul measure that established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) championed by Warren.AD

“Biden was simply not part of the conversation” surrounding the passage of Dodd-Frank, the oversight of the bank bailout and the creation of the CFPB, said one Warren ally who worked closely with her at the time and spoke on the condition of anonymity because their current employer is neutral in the presidential race.AD

By that point — Dodd-Frank passed in 2010 — some saw early signs of Warren’s interest in higher office.pressed Obama to appoint Warren as head of the CFPB, adding that she would probably run for Senate if she wasn’t nominated.Facing forceful opposition from Republican senators, Obama ultimately declined to nominate her — a blow to Warren, but one that set her on course for the Senate.“You gave me hell,” Biden joked to Warren, referring to their previous skirmishes.Whether they agree on every solution is different, but they are trying to address the same issues.”

In August 2015, as Biden was considering his own presidential bid, he invited Warren to lunch at the U.S.Warren had a different reaction.Warren called Reid, the Senate minority leader at the time, to tell him she planned to oppose the bill and push other Democrats to join her, according to the former Senate aide.(APPLAUSE)

Elizabeth Warren’s crusade against Silicon Valley has not dented her popularity among employees of major tech companies, according to the latest campaign fundraising filings.And yet Warren has raised nearly $160,000 from employees of one of her top rhetorical targets – Google – since the start of her presidential campaign, more than any other presidential candidate, according to an analysis of campaign finance filings for individual candidate committees for the first nine months of 2019.Warren came in second among software engineers, with $660,000 raised from 1,400 people, followed by Andrew Yang ($370,000 from 850 donors), a long shot candidate who has appealed to techies with an issue portfolio focusing on automation, data privacy and a universal basic income.Pete Buttigieg, a midwestern mayor who has staked out a more centrist position, followed Warren with about $125,000 from 192 Googlers.Facebook was the biggest exception to the Sanders/Warren juggernaut, with Buttigieg raking in nearly $38,000 from 53 employees, followed by $28,000 from 41 employees for California senator Kamala Harris.Zuckerberg has shown particular antipathy toward Warren, saying in leaked remarks that her election would “suck” for the company.In this edition: The risks of an anti-fracking litmus test, Elizabeth Warren endorses two “Justice Democrats,” and a two-year election in North Carolina comes to an end.Warren has tweeted that she would sign “an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands,” as well as “ban fracking — everywhere.” And while his official campaign climate plan does not call for an end to fracking, Biden said in the New Castle town hall and the second Democratic debate that he would phase out fossil fuels.On Monday, that cause got a boost from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D- Mass.“The people of Texas's 28th District are ready for systematic change and deserve a Democrat that will be on the side of working people, not the side of big money and obstructionist Republicans,” Warren said in endorsing Cisneros over Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas.But Warren's intervention drew a more intense response from the Cuellar and Lipinski camps.“Elizabeth Warren and our opponent share an agenda that would kill over 108,000 jobs in our region.Will you join me?”

Colin Strother, Cuellar's strategist, explained that the “108,000 jobs” figure was an estimate of how many jobs in Cuellar's South Texas district relied on natural gas; Warren, he said, was intervening in a place she couldn't pretend to understand, a far more conservative place than Massachusetts.“People come from all over the world to hunt quail, hogs and deer here.”

Strother also took a shot at Warren's popularity in Texas, saying she'd had “months to catch on” but hadn't, comparing her past claims of Native American heritage to Cisneros's emphasis on being an immigration lawyer.(Polling has found Warren to be competitive against President Trump in Texas, though marginally less popular than Joe Biden.)And isn't it fascinating that she’s not endorsing Warren in kind.Warren is not going to win this district.Voters had a chance to pick the socialist in 2016 and 3 to 1 they went against that.”

In a statement, Lipinski was a little lighter on Warren, worrying that she had “moved from independent fact-based thinking to ideological orthodoxy” by endorsing against him.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), whose 2018 win was Justice Democrats' greatest success so far, said she was encouraged to see Warren agreeing with activists who didn't consider incumbents to be untouchable.“I think we as Democrats need to be pro-democracy in a principled way, not just not just when it's convenient.”

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has warned consultants working with challengers that they won't get other contracts, was silent on Warren.Just 69 percent of likely primary voters say they view Warren favorably, relatively low for an incumbent, but Warren long has faced skepticism that she could win the primary or the general election; a Boston Globe editorial in December 2018 urged her not to run, warning that she would be too “divisive.”

2020

Bernie Sanders.Elizabeth Warren.It saw direct confrontation between candidates who had not previously squared off, like Pete Buttigieg and Tulsi Gabbard, or Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar, or Beto O’Rourke and Elizabeth Warren.He was more effective than Warren at defending the Medicare-for-all plan they both support (but which, he’s quick to note, he wrote), replying to concerns about its realism, “I’m tired of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel.— Dylan Matthews

If there was any lingering doubt that Warren has ascended to frontrunner status, this debate put it to rest.Warren was certainly treated like the frontrunner of the debate, judging by all the attacks she took.From the get-go, more moderate candidates including Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg jabbed at Warren, trying to pin her on whether she’d raise taxes in paying for Medicare-for-all.There were also a couple weird moments with Tulsi Gabbard, who challenged the Massachusetts senator to adopt her pro-Assad and “anti-regime change war” stance in Syria, and confronted Warren on her commander-in-chief bona fides before the moderators cut to commercial.The attacks shifting from Biden to Warren was a telling realignment — and signals a new political reality.That leaves a huge opening for a center-left candidate who opposes Medicare-for-all and avoids clear class conflict language (and gets the big donor support that comes with that) to take Biden’s place and emerge as the primary alternative to Warren (and, to a lesser degree, Bernie Sanders).He attacked Warren on Medicare-for-all.Seeming-frontrunner Warren, who talked about the issue the most, described America’s trade agreements as job-killing giveaways to greedy, unpatriotic corporations:

Ultimately, Warren is betting that few Americans will be overly distraught at the prospect that titans like Bezos, Gates or the Walton family could have fewer billions at their disposal.Warren’s campaign declined to comment on whether her wealth tax would reduce the underlying fortunes of the very rich, as some economists say.AD

“The wealthiest people need to pay their fair share so every person gets a chance to build a future, too,” said Saloni Sharma, a Warren spokeswoman.In her public comments, Warren is careful to say that the wealth tax is not intended punish the rich.“Understand, this isn’t punitive — that’s not the point,” Warren said last month at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire.Put a little back in so everybody else has a chance to make it.”

AD

In their new paper, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley argue that under Warren’s plan the great fortunes would not be taken away, but would simply grow more slowly.“Because it’s progressive, Warren’s wealth tax would slow wealth growth much more for the top 15 than for the very-rich-but-not-multi-billionaires,” Zucman said in an email.Some economists say that is not as straightforward as Warren can make it seem.For example, Warren frequently explains the tax by saying it is similar to a property tax, but one that is also intended to include “the yachts, the diamonds and the Rembrandts,” as she puts it.That means that each year, the wealthy taxpayer could have their assets chipped away by Warren’s levy, he said.Besides, no other campaign is doing quite what Warren is doing out here in the rural reaches.We need people in every precinct advocating for Elizabeth Warren.”

-- Warren claims her tax plan only asks the super-rich for “two cents.” But how much of a hit would billionaires and their peers really take if she implemented a 2 percent annual wealth tax on people with more than $50 million of assets?Annie Linskey reports: “The 15 largest fortunes in the country would be, on average, half their current size if the tax had been in place since 1982, according to new figures published by a pair of economists who helped Warren write her wealth tax proposal.One thing is clear: it’s getting harder to save enough for a decent retirement,” Warren wrote in a post on the website Medium on Thursday.“As a result, Social Security has become the main source of retirement income for most seniors.”

Warren’s proposal would increase benefits by $200 a month for Social Security recipients and extend the program’s solvency by two decades through increased contribution requirements on the top two percent of earners.Ahead of Thursday’s Democratic presidential debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren rolled out an ambitous new plan to address one of the nation’s most intractable problems — the future of Social Security.Advertisement

Warren proposed to pay for the plan by boosting the Social Security contributions — effectively a tax increase — of those making more than $250,000 a year.Warren argues that skyrocketing income inequality in recent decades has resulted in lower income workers paying a higher share of their wages into Social Security than wealthy Americans.Warren’s plan would impose a new 14.8 percent payroll tax on wages over $250,000, to be split evenly between employers and employees.Warren also wants to close loopholes that exempt certain types of income from being counted by the government for Social Security tax purposes.In addition to increasing benefits by $200 a month, Warren’s plan would try to close a gap in benefits between men and women and guarantee a larger minimum benefit for very low wage workers.To do this, Warren would add a Social Security credit for people who take time off work for unpaid caregiving, which she argues would help women and low-income people who are more likely to leave the workforce to care for children or aging relatives.“In part because of work and pay discrimination and time out of the workforce to provide care for children and elderly relatives, women receive an average monthly Social Security benefit that’s only 78% of the average monthly benefit for men,” Warren wrote.Advertisement

Warren’s plan would also allow public sector workers to receive full Social Security benefits by repealing provisions that ban some retirees from collecting both Social Security and a public pension.It will be the first time Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)THE TICKER

Thursday was the first time this year that Biden and Warren shared a debate stage, and there was considerable anticipation about what might happen.In the most recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, there was a clear gap between Biden and Warren and Sanders.Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) navigated their way through the evening, with Booker showing humor and humanity and Klobuchar stating more clearly than ever her belief that the policies of Warren and Sanders threaten to make it more difficult to defeat Trump or translate from proposal to legislation.On that, it’s 24 percent for Biden, 20 percent for Warren and 16 percent for Sanders.Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).AD

As Bloomberg News’s Shawn Donnan notes, the trade war has forced a lot of Americans to appreciate the ways in which manufacturing is positively associated with trade: “If China is often viewed as the bogeyman that stole America’s factories, the current reality is that many U.S.-based manufacturers’ fortunes are more linked to China, whether as a market or as a supplier, than Trump or his hawks are prepared to admit.” Why in the hell Warren thinks it is a good idea to echo one of Trump’s worst policy ideas is beyond me.He suggests that Warren is embracing an idea akin to the argument I made in “All Politics Is Global” and one that Newman has made in his scholarly work as well: that the United States can use its market power to set regulatory standards consistent with domestic policy preferences.As Warren puts it in her trade plan, the United States has “enormous leverage because America is the world’s most attractive market.” Newman suggests that “it is time for US foreign economic policy-makers to think seriously about policy objectives and then put our market power to good use.”

AD

This is both Newman’s and Warren’s theory of the case, one that I made back in 2007 as well.There is no good reason Trump is prosecuting a multi-front trade war and even less good reason for Warren to continue to prosecute Trump’s forever trade wars.As Newman well knows, the United States needs to build more state capacity to do this kind of thing properly — a fact that goes unmentioned in Warren’s policy framework.AD

Let me close with a simple policy proposal that should suss out whether Warren is a protectionist in the Trumpian mold (as I fear) or someone who genuinely just wants better trade deals (as Tucker, Newman and a lot of Warren fans insist).AD

If Warren is serious about trade and regulation, she should announce that her first two trade moves would be to lift most of Trump’s tariffs and to seriously negotiate a transatlantic trade and investment partnership.If Warren cannot get behind a transatlantic trade negotiation, then she is not serious about her plan.If Warren makes more positive-sounding noises on this, I promise to look at her policies anew.AD

From the scene of the latest mega-rally.DEMS IN DISARRAY

Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks to delegates during the 2019 Massachusetts Democratic Party Convention on Saturday in Springfield, Mass.But on Monday, the party endorsed Elizabeth Warren after a mixed voting process that included an online ballot for party members and an online vote for 50 members of the WFP's national committee.“More than 80 percent of voters listed Warren and Sanders as their top two picks.”

At first, Warren's majority was the story; the WFP's instant-runoff system, in which the second choices of members would be ranked and added up, didn't even come into play.Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa tweeted that he'd “heard the board got a signal from big donors that those donors would only fund a WFP [independent expenditure] if it was for Warren,” an allegation the WFP denied.The Working Families Party has waited decades for that future, but the party may have just written itself out of it.”

While the WFP has remained tight-lipped about the process, people familiar with the vote point to a few factors that helped Warren.Second, Warren allies, like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, repeatedly urged members to look for the WFP ballot — it cost nothing to sign up to vote — while Sanders allies did less.But Biden's support in those demographics tops out at 32 percent, and while he does best with New York City voters, Warren wins suburban voters and union households — demographics that also stuck with Clinton in the 2016 primary.But this gets to the reason many Democrats are looking at Warren’s strength in early states, as other candidates fade or run low on cash: Increasingly, she’s the most popular second choice of Democratic primary voters, and Joe Biden, while holding a lead, has not been picking up those voters.And the Charlotte Observer condemned both parties in an editorial, arguing that “the court should wrest the maps from the hands of lawmakers and either give the task to a special master or, if there’s time before 2020, allow lawmakers to pursue an independent commission.”

The Campaign

BATTLE OF THE PROGRESSIVE STARS: In the fight to be the left's standard-bearer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)“We ultimately believe that Sen. Warren will be the nominee,” Maurice Mitchell, the group's national director, told Power Up.And it happened on a particularly strong day for Warren: She rallied a huge crowd of 20,000 people in Washington Square Park in New York City and unveiled her plan to address corruption in Washington by limiting “the influence of federal lawmakers and lobbyists while also expanding protections for workers,” per my colleague Amy Wang.It's working and it's working with a lot of different audiences — her campaign is attracting a lot of folks who are part of the progressive wing, a lot of folks who have not been political observers but are now fighting for something they believe in.”

During her speech last night, Warren compared herself to a crusader for worker's rights: Frances Perkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's labor secretary and the first female member of the U.S.“The speech also highlighted Warren’s theory of change,” according to Time Magazine's Charlotte Alter: “While the women of the trade unions kept pushing from the outside, Frances pushed from the inside,” Warren said.(They got 23K rsvps, an aide says, and stopped counting attendees at 20K once Warren began speaking.)#Bernie2020 — Misty Rebik (@mistyrebik) September 16, 2019

WFP endorsement is also a reflection of the left's strategic maneuvering against Biden: The former Obama veep often touts his record as a “Union man.” But Mitchell, who was previously an organizing leader for Black Lives Matter, said that the group's endorsement of Warren “is a bit of a myth buster” that Biden is the labor union candidate.“There's got to be some respect for the working people, if they want their vote.” Biden allies, however, are challenging the notion that Warren's agenda is better for working class families.They cited Warren's plan to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her Medicare-for-all proposal.During the debates last week, Warren repeatedly dodged questions about whether she will raise taxes on middle class families to pay for the program.The end of Warren's selfie line after last night's huge NYC rally:

11:38pm - @ewarren is done and the last picture has been taken.It has been almost four hours since the end of Warren’s speech.“Grab some trash and let’s GO!” shouts a Warren staffer.Biden declined to participate in the following climate forum, on MSNBC, as did Warren and three other major Democratic candidates.But Warren began by recalling the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers — almost all women — in just 18 minutes, only a block from where she was standing.It wasn’t just the bosses who locked them in the factory to prevent theft who were to blame for the fire and the deaths, Warren said; it was a corrupt political establishment, doing the bidding of wealthy business owners, who created the conditions that led to the tragedy.“Business owners got richer, politicians got more powerful, and working people paid the price,” Warren said.AD

AD

From the Triangle fire, Warren argued that our inability to make any positive change on matters ranging from climate change, income inequality, gun control and health-care reform is the result of the corrupt capture of our government by the obscenely wealthy to keep and increase their money and power, the rest of us be damned.Warren then turned to the female-dominated reform movement of the Gilded Age.“Frances pushed from the inside,” Warren said.Big structural change.” It took Perkins and all the women — so many of the reformers were women — who marched with her, over and over again, to slowly but surely reform the system and American lives for the better, Warren said.To make change, she argued, requires the cooperation of both the activists who challenge the power and the bridge figures, like Perkins — and Warren, or so her argument goes.Will it all translate into primary votes for Warren?If the rally showed the enthusiasm of Warren supporters — she spent hours after the event taking selfies with more than 4,000 people, her campaign said — it showed signs of Warren’s continuing struggles, too.Yes, she would like to vote for a woman, and yes, she likes Warren’s plans, but there’s something more ephemeral, too.“I feel more hopeful with Warren,” Straub said.“There’s something about Elizabeth Warren,” said Fiona Murray, 50, a Manhattan musician, who called her “inspiring.”

Perhaps that hope and inspiration is because Warren projects a peppy, can-do attitude.Warren once did a turn as a personal finance guru, writing a book that offered advice to economically strapped Americans.He recently faced scrutiny for inappropriate touching of women, but was thought to deal with the criticism well EPA 3/22 Elizabeth Warren The Massachusetts Senator has formally launched her bid for president in 2020.He recently faced scrutiny for inappropriate touching of women, but was thought to deal with the criticism well EPA 3/22 Elizabeth Warren The Massachusetts Senator has formally launched her bid for president in 2020.2020 WATCH:

Elizabeth Warren hailed the political power of female-led organizing in a speech Monday night that invoked the deadly 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire to argue that outrage can spark positive change — and to make the case for her own presidential ambitions."Warren has long faced doubts from some Democratic leaders and voters who wonder if she would be able to defeat President Trump, because of her outspoken liberal message and voters’ possible reluctance to embrace a woman as president.Monday’s speech, and the big crowd it attracted, was in part an attempt to rebut such doubts by arguing that liberal women have won big change before... At one point in her speech Monday, when Warren said the rich and powerful have 'gobbled up opportunity itself' but that 'we have the power to fix that,' the crowd interrupted with chants of 'Warren!Warren!'"“After backing Bernie Sanders in 2016, the Working Families Party on Monday voted to endorse Sen.

But right now, there is definitely a difference in Warren’s and Biden’s support: Warren is indeed winning among college-educated voters and self-identified liberals, while Biden relies heavily on non-college-educated voters, moderates and African Americans.None other than late-night host Stephen Colbert made it painfully clear that Warren is ducking.Warren’s brand is truth-telling about the rich and powerful, but you simply cannot get the rich and big corporations to pay for all of it.AD

Warren of all people, who prides herself on talking policy and treating voters like grown-ups, should be capable of spelling it out.As a political matter, Warren should get out ahead of this and put out the numbers herself before she is badgered in the next debate, or before her opponents start making it a feature of their criticisms of her.Biden, Sanders, and Warren are all in their way formidable contenders who bring lots of assets and political skills to the table.A September 18 Survey USA poll confirmed that Biden does best, followed by Sanders followed by Warren, followed by Harris.But then why do Warren and Harris do better than O’Rourke and Buttigieg?Look beyond the top three

If Warren becomes the Democratic nominee and beats Trump she will become, on Inauguration Day, the oldest person ever sworn in as president of the United States.Warren was frequently feuding with members of Obama’s economic team and has embraced a number of electorally dicey positions like providing government health benefits to undocumented immigrants.But Biden’s strong standing in the polls, the fact that Warren and Sanders combined have only about a third of the estimated vote, and the extent to which a healthy share of Sanders supporters self-identify as moderate suggests that this isn’t the view of most Democrats.However, it’s Buttigieg (81 percent positive) and Warren (84 percent positive) who seem to have made the best impression in a state known for “Iowa nice.”

Needless to say, the potential for Buttigieg and Klobuchar (for whom the Focus poll has shown better numbers than other polls) to soar to the top tier in the primary race remains.Despite Warren’s strong showing, “Support for a centrist candidate remains.And it’s worth noting that no one has gotten more practice in town halls than Warren, who has done more than 100 of them.But the observation about Buttigieg’s appeal does seem germane to a certain Kennedyesque feature of his campaign, and its most self-conscious aspect: his youth, in comparison, certainly, to the candidates currently at the top of the heap — 76-year-old Biden, 70-year-old Elizabeth Warren, 78-year-old Bernie Sanders.(“Thirty-five percent of Democratic primary voters say they’re ‘enthusiastic’ about Warren (which is up 9 points since June), another 35 percent are ‘comfortable’ with her and just 6 percent are ‘very uncomfortable.’ ... Bernie Sanders’ numbers are 25 percent enthusiastic, 37 percent comfortable and 12 percent very uncomfortable.”) Warren’s biggest concern may be if he remains in the race all the way to the convention, preventing her from putting together all the “very liberal” votes that she will need to beat Biden.AD

AD

Warren ignored the media, stuck to her small-donor/selfie model of campaigning and fundraising and got better and better on the stump.Then finally this week, the Democrats — who have long tried to ignore Trump’s bigger-is-better ethos — offered a tangible response of their own in the form of Elizabeth Warren’s Monday evening rally in New York City’s Washington Square Park, where the senator from Massachusetts showed that she, too, could match the spectacle of Trump, right down to the large cheering throngs.“Yeah, the lines keep getting longer,” Warren told reporters in New York on Tuesday, when asked about the four-hour wait for photos with her that capped her Monday rally, which was attended by more than 20,000 people.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday en route to California, Trump rejected the significance of Warren’s Monday night masses — and with no evidence rebutted her crowd count — saying that “anybody” can attract crowds “standing in the middle of Manhattan in the most densely populated area of the country.”

“I get these crowds in areas that nobody’s ever seen crowds before,” Trump continued.Certainly if I went to Manhattan, if I went there — number one, she didn’t have 20,000 people, and number two, I think anybody would get a good crowd there.”

Nonetheless, the multitudes who gathered after a light rain to hear Warren’s plan to fix what she describes as systematic corruption — and to cheer her rebuke of Trump as “corruption in the flesh” — provided clear evidence that Warren, even in a Democratic primary, can compete on the same terms as a president who revels in crowd size above almost all else.“Big, structural change in Washington Square Park with @ewarren,” tweeted Warren communications director Kristen Orthman, captioning a photo of the park’s marble arch overflowing with Warren supporters — so many specks of frozen fervor — and glowing incandescent in the moonlight.The missive captured Warren’s pitch of major government and corporate overhaul but also seemed a clear allusion to her crowd size, which New York City’s park service initially expected to number between 8,000 and 10,000 people before more than doubling those early estimates.'Hours and hours'

Warren’s crowds show “that not only does she have broad reach — she has broad enthusiasm,” said Rebecca Katz, a liberal strategist who hasn’t endorsed a candidate in the presidential primary.To defeat Trump in the general election, she said, Democrats will need to nominate someone who generates the same excitement — pointing to the long line of Warren supporters who waited until nearly midnight for photos of her as one indication of her appeal.“There’s a lot of talk about raising money and electability, but there’s nothing nearly as important to winning in 2020 as voter enthusiasm.”

To Warren supporters, too, the overwhelming crowd size was meaningful.“It’s so democratizing for a major presidential candidate to stand and wait for all the people who obviously want to see her,” gushed Devon Racinelli, 25, who was last in one of two lines that formed for photos with Warren on Monday night.The size of the crowd also inspired some to view a Warren candidacy as truly viable.In some ways, both Trump and Warren are making similar appeals to fiery populism, but with very different approaches.Warren’s supporters chant “Two cents!” — a shorthand for her proposed annual wealth tax on those with fortunes over $50 million — while Trump’s crowds cheer “Build the wall!” in reference to his promised border barrier.Those who attend Warren events also tend to file in shortly before she starts speaking and then stay hours afterward for a photo.“Everyone is obsessed with finding the most ‘electable’ candidate, but no one really knows what that means,” said Zach Simonson, the chair of the Wapello County Democrats in Iowa who was impressed with Warren’s New York event.“Everyone was late to appreciate the seriousness of his candidacy, but once he started winning places, it became apparent that people weren’t just turning out because he put on a great show, but there was real support there.”

Conant added that, like Trump, Warren is drawing her biggest crowds not in early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire but in Democratic strongholds like St. Paul, Minn., and Manhattan.If you’re going to go to the trouble to show up at an event, you’re probably going to vote, and you’re more likely to donate or talk to your neighbors about voting, too.”

Trump allies say that while Warren’s supporters may have provided an impressive showing this week, the events by her and other Democrats still pale in comparison to the overflow crowds the president regularly addresses.“There’s no movement of this magnitude in modern political history.”

He added, “It’s no great feat for a leftist to attract people in Manhattan or Seattle and it probably took Warren’s campaign weeks of planning to do even that.”

Still, one Republican operative in frequent touch with the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment, noted that for all the dismissiveness, Trump himself did pay attention to Warren’s event.Markey has already received the endorsement of fellow Massachusetts Sen.

But the broader unfolding critique against Warren attempts to raise deeper questions about how she presents herself.Warren’s team has refused to be swayed by such taunts.Warren, a former statewide high school debate champion, has ably defused confrontation in the first three debates, repeatedly returning to her central message, which is that she is a fighter ready to confront political and economic elites who are responsible for middle-class struggles.AD

“We will continue to run the campaign we have from the beginning — identifying what is broken, talking about our plans to fix it, and building a grass-roots movement to make it happen,” Warren communications director Kristen Orthman said in response to the attacks.His campaign previewed the last debate by boasting that he was the only candidate who had released 20 years of tax returns — an oblique reference to Warren, who has released 11 years of returns, not including years when she did the bulk of her corporate legal work.Warren has argued that the corporate work she did while serving as a law professor — for clients such as Dow Chemical and Travelers Insurance — was focused on helping “victims hurt by bankrupt companies,” including asbestos claimants and women with breast implants that could rupture.The decision to go after Warren more directly carries clear risks for her rivals.But Warren’s rivals also feel there is a potentially greater cost to letting Warren continue her campaign without more scrutiny, after showing herself to be the only candidate in the race who has been gaining strength for much of the year.“She hasn’t been tested in the same way.”

John McCain of Arizona’s 2008 campaign manager and left the Republican Party because of Trump, said that Warren’s vulnerability on this score will be tested if she makes it to the general election.AD

While liberals dismiss the president’s “Pocahontas” nickname for Warren as a racist slur, Schmidt said that many voters probably will hear in it a reminder of the allegation that Warren tried to game the system in academia, although those involved in her hirings say it did not play a role.“Any candidate that gets into a quagmire around honesty issues with Trump is going to be a defeated candidate.”

So far, Warren has not had to worry about attacks from the other leading candidate in the race pushing for dramatic policy change.But there are some staff-level tensions below the surface, as Sanders advisers seek to draw electability comparisons with Warren.An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll on Tuesday showed Warren slightly edging Sanders and Biden among Latinos, and polling higher than Sanders among whites without a college degree.He plans to hold a rally Sunday in Norman, Okla., Warren’s birthplace, and one of the few states that will vote in the early spring that she has yet to visit as part of her campaign.AD

And that brings me to the wild card: Warren.As I’ve noted, the fact that Warren hasn’t released a health-care plan yet is bizarre, since she’s released plans on pretty much everything else, from child care to corporate board restructuring to keeping leaves out of your gutters.Warren says she supports Medicare-for-all and frequently criticizes insurance companies, but I can’t help but suspect that the delay in her producing a written plan has something to do with those polls showing voluntary public options to be more popular.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is generally out of the margin of error (he leads by nearly seven points in the RCP averages) while Warren, Harris and Pete Buttigieg lead by single digits.Given all that, Warren’s plea not to be “scared” gets to the nub of the problem.However, it’s probably not a good idea for Warren to talk about voters being “scared.” That’s a little like the “don’t think about pink elephants.” Voters (not her devoted base but others she needs to win over) are scared, and loss aversion tells us that when people are scared, they will overweigh losses relative to gains.Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).His national average in RealClearPolitics polls is 16.1 percent, and he’s been neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)“The U.S. military has spent more than $184,000 at President Trump’s golf resort in Scotland since he took office, far more than previously known, according to documents released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee.”

"It's valid for Warren to want to refocus the issue on total costs rather than just taxes,” The Post’s Aaron Blake writes."This is why Warren supporters hate this question.They view it as an unfair attempt to give Republicans a talking point that ‘Elizabeth Warren is going to raise middle-class taxes!’ when, in fact, people’s total costs would go down.” Aaron adds it’s important to note studies show that while most people would pay less in such a system, it’s not necessarily consistent for all people.Warren's responses are opening her up to criticism from Democratic rivals.South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said this on CNN: “Senator Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we’ve seen that repeatedly.”
