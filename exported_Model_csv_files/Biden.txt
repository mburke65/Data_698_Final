Biden, the top-polling 2020 Democratic presidential candidate who beats Trump in head-to-head matchups in battleground states and nationwide, said Saturday that if the president did that, it’s only because “he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.”

Biden also challenged Trump to release a transcript of his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.Biden found himself at the center of a massive political scandal that includes unfounded accusations spread by Trump and his allies that Biden used his influence as vice president to help his son with a business deal.AD

Trump and his allies reportedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Biden’s efforts in 2016 to convince Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who at the time was also investigating a natural gas company that employed Hunter.Biden said he knew nothing of his son’s business deal and was acting on behalf of the United States, which saw the prosecutor as ineffective at stamping out corruption.AD

The Biden campaign sent a lengthy memo to reporters Saturday listing quotes from various news outlets, including the Kyiv Post in Ukraine, discrediting Trump’s attack.The memo seems part of a larger Biden campaign effort to get ahead of the story and keep history from repeating itself — if Trump keeps peddling the story, it could dog his campaign just as Hillary Clinton’s emails dogged hers.AD

Biden, campaigning at the Polk County, Iowa, Steak Fry, wouldn’t say whether Trump deserves to be impeached over his alleged conversations with Zelensky, but said the House should investigate.“This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power, to get on the phone with a foreign power who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me, if that’s what happened, that’s what appears to have happened,” Biden told reporters.AD

Trump has neither confirmed or denied that he spoke to Zelensky about Biden, saying only that his conversations with the foreign leader were appropriate and calling these latest allegations another witch hunt.AD

AD

Trump on Friday repeated his denial that he has done anything untoward in his conversations with world leaders, but he refused to address whether he had raised the issue of a dormant investigation of a company that previously employed the Democratic presidential contender’s son, Hunter Biden.The revelation that Trump pushed Zelensky to pursue the probe of a company with links to Biden, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, helps to explain why a U.S. intelligence official who apparently learned about the call felt compelled to file a whistleblower action against the president.“But my understanding of what has taken place is, this is just a different version of Russia collusion — Russiagate 2.0.”

Biden addressed the issue of his son’s business dealings in Ukraine on Friday after emerging from a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.“Wait a second,” Biden said, raising his hands to silence reporters.And so I have no comment except the president should start to, uh, be president.”

AD

Biden later issued a statement calling for the release of the transcript of Trump’s call with Zelensky and saying, “If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has been unusually active — meeting overseas with Ukrainian officials and working through surrogates — to push government investigators to reopen a probe of a gas company that had hired Hunter Biden to serve as a board member and adviser while his father was U.S. vice president.In a volatile television appearance on Thursday, Giuliani initially denied that he had demanded that Ukraine dig deeper into the probe involving Biden before reversing himself and admitting he had done so.What neither government said publicly at the time was that Trump went even further — specifically pressing Ukraine’s president to reopen a corruption investigation involving former vice president Joe Biden’s son, according to two people familiar with the call, which is now the subject of an explosive whistleblower complaint.One was a probe of a Ukrainian gas tycoon who had Biden’s son Hunter on his board.Asked Friday if he had discussed Biden on his call with Zelensky in July, Trump told reporters, “It doesn’t matter what I discussed,” adding: “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden.”

AD

National security experts said Trump’s pressure on Ukraine was highly inappropriate.AD

Giuliani said Trump did not threaten to withhold U.S. funds from Ukraine if the country did not investigate Biden and Democrats.AD

Meanwhile, throughout the spring and summer, Giuliani was pressing the Ukrainian government behind the scenes, gathering information about Biden and briefing Trump on his findings, he said in several interviews with The Washington Post.AD

Giuliani has pushed Ukrainian officials to renew an investigation into the activities of Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas producer while his father handled U.S.-Ukraine policy.In particular, Giuliani has alleged Biden advocated for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who at one point had overseen an anti-corruption probe of the gas producer’s owner.AD

Yuri Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News in May that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.But Giuliani has said there is more to uncover, adding that his goal is to make sure Biden didn’t become president without having to answer for the issues in Ukraine.“The president’s counsel is entitled to develop evidence.”

Biden has denied any wrongdoing.Asked by reporters on the trip if he brought up Biden with his meeting with Zelensky, Pence said he did not.Earlier this month, House Democrats launched an investigation into whether Trump sought to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden in exchange for receiving U.S. foreign aid.with only 18 days left in the fiscal year,” Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said during an appropriations committee hearing last week, asking: “Why the delay?”

Privately, Democrats are wondering whether the Trump administration was trying to use that money as leverage over the Ukrainian president, hopeful it would spur an investigation of Biden, who is a leading Democratic candidate for president.Biden on Friday suggested there could be a connection.They have also alleged that Obama and Biden tried to leverage U.S. aid in their dealings with Ukraine.House Republican leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Friday: “I just watched our former vice president, in his own words, say he influenced Ukraine to fire somebody based upon aid that America was providing.” McCarthy was referring to comments Biden made at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018, bragging that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, not military aid, unless Ukrainian leaders promptly fired the country’s top prosecutor.In letters to the White House and State Department, top Democrats earlier this month demanded records related to what they say are Trump and Giuliani’s efforts “to coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity” — one to help Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is in prison for illegal lobbying and financial fraud, and a second to target the son of former vice president Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump.“If I’m not worried about it, he’s not worried about it.”

AD

House Democrats are looking into whether Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure that government outside of formal diplomatic channels to effectively help the Trump reelection effort by investigating Hunter Biden about his time on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company.President Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden ’s son, urging Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, on a probe, according to people familiar with the matter.“He told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know” whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said.The Trump lawyer has suggested Mr. Biden as vice president worked to shield from investigation a Ukrainian gas company with ties to his son, Hunter Biden.A Ukrainian official earlier this year said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son.AD

Given that Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani have already gone to great lengths to pressure Ukraine to launch an investigation that would damage Joe Biden, the most likely general-election opponent of Trump, speculation has naturally centered on the idea that the whistleblower complaint might concern this effort.But we already know three House committees are investigating what appear to be extensive efforts by Trump and Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government into launching investigations designed to dig up dirt on Biden.AD

AD

The ostensible reason for those efforts is a complicated allegation that Biden improperly pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was looking into a company on whose board Biden’s son sat.In fact, there were extensive efforts by many parties to oust the prosecutor for other reasons, and the current prosecutor has said neither Biden did anything wrong.As Viola Gienger put it in a must-read explainer: “With the drama over assistance to Ukraine unfolding alongside Trump’s and Giuliani’s months-long drumbeat for an investigation into Biden’s role there, the clear impression is that the United States is extorting a partner country for political gain.”

Giuliani helpfully tweeted this:

A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.Maybe if Obama did that the Biden Family wouldn’t have bilked millions from Ukraine and billions from China; being covered up by a Corrupt Media.AD

We don’t know that an effort to get Ukraine to dig dirt on Biden is the subject of the whistleblower complaint.continues to rise nationally and as Harris — and other candidates — struggle to dent the strength of former vice president Joe Biden in the polls.But Biden holds a persistent lead in the state, where he benefits from the loyalty of many black voters.An Iowa poll released this week, conducted by longtime Harris pollster David Binder for Focus on Rural America, found Harris at five percent in the state, trailing not only Biden, Warren and Sanders but also South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.AD

Asked on Thursday about that drop in polls, Adams said the campaign never believed the earlier polling spike would last, referring to it as “a sugar high.”

But the unspoken challenge — for Harris as well as other Democrats — is Biden’s durability, as Harris advisers and allies acknowledge privately.Despite attacks from his rivals, multiple gaffes and questions about his age and record, Biden has maintained his spot atop virtually all state and national polls.But so far, she been unable to dislodge or put a visible dent in Biden’s prospects in Iowa, South Carolina or elsewhere.“I don’t know what their plan is to maintain that [durability],” Adams said of Biden.AD

In the last debate, Harris often looked directly at the camera and challenged President Trump rather than her Democratic rivals, something her advisers say reflects her argument that the former California attorney general is the best candidate to “prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump.”

Harris has also touted — and spent her Iowa advertising dollars explaining — a “3 a.m. agenda,” her plan to address the issues “that keep Americans up at night.” She’s sought to position herself, between Biden on the one hand and the liberal Warren and Sanders on the other, as a “problem-solving” candidate who favors big change but will take practical steps to achieve it.But I think that going back is not usually how Democrats conducted campaigns,” she said in a reference to Biden.@ChrisCuomo: "So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"@RudyGiuliani: "Of course I did"

Giuliani spent the first half of the interview repeating the claim that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, which at the time was also investigating a natural gas company where Biden’s son Hunter was on the board.Biden threatened to withhold loan money from the country over it.There’s been no evidence found that Biden was trying to help out his son.AD

“You never asked anything about Hunter Biden?You never asked anything about Joe Biden and the prosecutor?” Cuomo asked again.“So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden,” Cuomo said.Giuliani then tried to distinguish between asking Ukraine about Biden and asking about “allegations related to my client which tangentially involve Joe Biden and a massive bribery scheme.”

AD

As the two men verbally sparred, Giuliani said, “It’s sad to watch what happened to you.And I’m proud of it!”

Later, Cuomo told Giuliani: “This president got the benefit of something you built up for decades — your credibility.”

When Cuomo directed the conversation back to Trump, Giuliani tried to discredit the whistleblower, saying without any evidence that the person “could be a Democrat holdover trying to destroy Donald Trump.”

He offered a line of defense if Trump did offer aid to Ukraine in exchange for the country investigating Clinton and Biden, claiming it would be “perfectly appropriate.”

“The reality is the president of the United States has every right to say to another leader of a foreign country, ‘you got to straighten up before we give you a lot of money,’ ” Giuliani said.Maybe if Obama did that the Biden Family wouldn’t have bilked millions from Ukraine and billions from China; being covered up by a Corrupt Media.In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden that he bribed the president of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son.You've also covered up the fact that Biden and his son took $1.5 billion out of China.And because it’s Joe Biden, and he’s a protected Democrat, you don’t cover it.CUOMO: That's what Joe Biden is.AD

Campaigning in Iowa on Saturday, Biden, the top polling 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, called on Trump to release a transcript of his call with Zelensky.Let the House see it and see what he did,” Biden told reporters, according to video of the exchange posted by CNN.Biden said he’d never spoken to his son about his business overseas and accused Trump of “doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum and is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to smear.”

Biden’s efforts to get the top Ukrainian prosecutor removed was related to the United States’ belief that he wasn’t weeding out corruption in the country.No evidence has been found that Biden was trying to help his son.AD

After Trump tweeted complaining that the media wouldn’t cover the Biden story, he tweeted a video montage showing the media covering the Biden story.Subsequent reporting found that during the call Trump pressured Volodymyr to look into Biden’s son.Then, Giuliani followed up with a more specific request that the country examine both the Ukrainian natural gas company who had Biden’s son Hunter on his board as well as whether Democrats had colluded with Ukraine to get information about former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.AD

“Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone “bust” on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden.Trump’s comments echo a defense first laid out Thursday night by his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who argued that the president could ask a foreign leader anything he wanted and that the real story was related to Biden’s pressuring the Ukrainian government in 2016 to fire its top prosecutor who at the time happened to be investigating a company in which Biden’s son, Hunter, had a stake.The challenge of taking advantage of this political moment without becoming ensnared was evident by how Biden responded to the news Friday afternoon.Not one single one,” Biden told reporters in Iowa on Friday afternoon, referring to the allegations related to his son, after initially ignoring shouted questions.But two hours later, Biden’s campaign released a written statement that was far more robust.AD

AD

“This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,” Biden said in the statement.“It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation — a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia — pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.”

The heightened scrutiny of Trump’s interactions with the Ukrainian leader, and efforts by congressional Democrats to investigate it, thrust the 2020 campaign into uncertain terrain — for Trump and Biden, who leads the polls in a crowded Democratic primary field.When Biden first entered the presidential race, it triggered a burst of attention on Hunter Biden’s foreign business ties and made-for-tabloid lifestyle.AD

AD

The Biden campaign had hoped it had dispatched with some of those questions.While the hearings would focus on Trump’s behavior, House Republicans would also amplify questions over Biden’s actions while he was in office.Several Democratic presidential candidates on Friday condemned Trump without mentioning Biden.called it “behavior you’d expect from an incompetent mobster.”

AD

But the news also comes at a time when some of Biden’s Democratic rivals are growing increasingly desperate to gain traction, and shedding some of their unwillingness to attack him forcefully.And while some may rally behind Biden for what they view as an unfair — and potentially illegal — targeting of a fellow Democrat, it could lead others to question whether he is best fit to counter Trump.“It’s going to be problematic for Biden to have to answer those questions about himself.”

“Whether it’s true or not, the fact that you have to deal with it is problematic.“They want to create the narrative, ‘I can win, I can take on Trump, don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good in terms of ideological fights.’ This is the stuff they don’t want to be talking about.”

AD

Biden allies, meanwhile, hope that elevating the case surrounding Hunter Biden will dispel the notion that he did anything wrong.It also serves as a vivid example of how worried Trump is about Biden’s prospects in a general election.On Friday night, Biden sent out a fundraising email saying, “Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family.”

AD

Trump’s campaign has spent months focused on Biden’s family, attempting to cast the former senator and vice president as a lifelong politician whose family has been personally enriched off his powerful positions.Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has suggested that Biden improperly used his influence to get Ukraine to dismiss its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016.The prosecutor general’s office had opened an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a national gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had a position starting in April 2014.AD

Biden traveled to Ukraine in March 2016 and said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Shokin was removed.AD

“We found no evidence to support the idea that Joe Biden advocated with his son’s interests in mind,” PolitiFact wrote in May.“It’s not even clear that the company was actively under investigation or that a change in prosecutors benefited it.”

One of the reasons Biden took a long time to decide whether to get into the presidential race was over considerations of the attacks on his family that not only come under the bright lights of a national campaign but also from the bullying tactics that Trump has employed.AD

Biden’s campaign earlier this year declined to say whether it had done a full vetting of Hunter, which campaigns sometimes do to prevent surprises.During Biden’s announcement speech in Philadelphia, most of Biden’s immediate family appeared onstage with him.“ ‘Mommy and daddy had a divorce and they’re going to really go after that,’ ” Biden recounted hearing from one of his grandchildren.“My generic point is they know how tough it’s going to be.”

Biden was asked last month about the appropriateness of Giuliani’s efforts, and reports that the State Department was cooperating with his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate his son.“I’m not worried about it,” Biden responded.And appropriateness has never been the measure they’ve started with.”

When asked about concerns of a quid pro quo, Biden demurred.“I’m concerned as well, too, of what Joe Biden—”

AD

A reporter interjected to point out that the whistleblower had gone through the appropriate channels at his agency by reporting it to the inspector general for the intelligence community.Instead he pivoted to Biden and the accusation that as vice president he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor because he was ineffective at weeding out corruption.At the time, the prosecutor was also investigating a natural gas company that Biden’s son Hunter Biden was on the board of.“It’s interesting to me, from other things I’ve heard about what Joe Biden and his son, why would he want that individual fired,” McCarthy said.“So there’s a lot of concerns I have.”

No evidence has been found that Biden’s dealings with Ukraine during the Obama administration had anything to do with his son.That effort, led by Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, theorizes that Biden acted inappropriately in 2016 when he called for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor at the risk of Ukraine losing substantial foreign aid.The prosecutor may have been investigating a company that had Biden’s son Hunter as a board member, but the prosecutor was also a target of widespread criticism for failing to adequately crack down on public corruption.The Bidens have repeatedly insisted that the then-vice president’s demand of Ukraine wasn’t linked to Hunter Biden’s work.According to Zelensky’s office, that call included Trump’s expressing confidence that “the new Ukrainian government” — Zelensky was sworn in in late May — “will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.”

“Corruption” is precisely how Giuliani referred to his Biden investigation on CNN on Thursday night.“He had every right to say to the Ukrainian president, ‘We have two outstanding allegations of massive corruption, and you should investigate it,’ ” Giuliani said when asked by host Chris Cuomo whether Trump had mentioned Biden to Zelensky.AD

AD

The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that during Trump’s call with Zelensky, Trump had been more specific than Giuliani suggests, pressuring the Ukrainian president to target Hunter Biden specifically.AD

AD

Trump himself mentioned the Biden allegations in a Fox News interview in May.“Look at Joe Biden,” he said.Can you imagine if I did that?”

As The Post has reported, this is an inaccurate representation of what Biden did.Oh, I think I’d want to hear it.”

That comment prompted a public rebuke from the chair of the Federal Election Commission, who said that what Trump suggested was illegal, and “not a novel concept.” Trump later revised his comment to say that while “of course, you have to look at it,” he would then “give it to the FBI or report it to the attorney general or somebody like that.”

AD

The conversation with Zelensky was July 25, well after Trump expressed concern about Biden’s actions and after he acknowledged that he was receptive to looking at material provided by foreign countries.Unusually, The Post’s editorial board wrote Sept. 5 that it had been “reliably told” that the withholding of aid was meant “to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.”

AD

There are a lot of moving parts here, and it’s not confirmed that the whistleblower complaint specifically deals with Trump having discussed the Biden allegations with Ukraine’s president.But the following order of events is correct:

Giuliani’s intent to go to Ukraine to talk to Zelensky about Biden is reported.Trump talks to Zelensky, pressuring him to investigate Hunter Biden.Trump and his fixer Giuliani, it has been widely reported, have been pressuring Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden based on a groundless theory that as vice president he was helping his son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.(Biden was accused of getting a prosecutor investigating his son’s company fired.In fact, “The investigation into Burisma, Hunter Biden’s employer, had ground to a halt long before the prosecutor was sacked.https://t.co/8yXFiFRlQm — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019

All of this raises the question as to whether the multiple actions amounted to a “promise” by Trump to release aid in exchange for Ukraine’s help investigating Biden.Former prosecutor Renato Mariotti tweeted, “If Trump promised foreign aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating Biden’s son, that is obviously corrupt and should meet any definition of a ‘high crime’ for impeachment.”

AD

AD

Meanwhile, Giuliani made a wild appearance on CNN.Amid the accusations and insults, he acknowledged that “of course” he asked Ukraine to look into Biden.In that conversation, he pressed the Ukrainian leader to reopen an investigation into a company that at one time had Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden, on its board.Giuliani further pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue the investigation involving Biden’s son, as well as one about alleged Democratic involvement with Ukrainians affecting Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman who is in prison.And with statements and weekend tweets, he has redoubled efforts to draw attention away from himself and shift it to Biden and Biden’s son.“Someone ought to look into Joe Biden,” he said Friday.“It doesn’t matter what I discussed, but I will say this — somebody ought to look into Joe Biden,” Trump said Friday in the Oval Office, swatting away questions about whether he had improperly attempted to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the former vice president.AD

Giuliani has long been trying to draw attention to Biden’s involvement, as vice president, in pressuring Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, who was viewed as ineffective at ferreting out corruption but was also, at the time, investigating a natural-gas company on whose board Biden’s son Hunter sat.AD

In a combative and disjointed interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo on Thursday evening, Giuliani contradicted himself in rapid succession, first saying he had never asked Ukraine to investigate Biden, before shouting that he had, in fact, pushed for such an investigation.Lewandowski: “There was no briefing provided by anybody from the Obama-Biden administration, members of the intelligence community or the FBI to our campaign that I — when I was present or during my tenure as the campaign manager.”

AD

Gaetz: “Man, that’s just baffling to me.We have to protect it, and yet when the Obama-Biden administration knew that there might be nefarious efforts to interfere or co-opt or in any way disturb our democracy, they didn’t say anything to you.Now, as you sit here today, having watched these facts unfold, do you have any, any rationale as to why maybe the Clapper-Brennan-Comey-Obama-Biden team didn’t want to give the Trump campaign a fair defensive briefing about the threats that we were facing?”

Lewandowski: “It’s actually unfathomable to me that they didn’t contact the major political nominee for president of the United States and inform them of potential threats against the election process in 2016.”

Trump’s repeated request of Zelensky that Ukraine investigate the Bidens would form one portion of a potential quid pro quo, but our reporting indicates Trump didn’t mention foreign aid on the call.AD

The other big one — and apparently the more significant one when it comes to what we see today — is the situation involving the Bidens.As The Post’s Michael Kranish and David L. Stern detailed in July, Hunter Biden took a well-paying job on the board of Ukraine’s largest private gas company, Burisma Holdings, late in the Obama administration.Shokin was removed amid pressure from then-Vice President Biden and other Western leaders, who alleged that he wasn’t pursuing corruption cases seriously enough.How substantial are the allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden?The contention from Trump, Giuliani, et al., is that Biden was taking an action to benefit his son’s company.Shokin himself alleged to The Post “that the activities of Burisma, the involvement of his son, Hunter Biden, and the [prosecutor general’s office] investigators on his tail, are the only, I emphasize, the only motives for organizing my resignation.”

AD

But Shokin’s contention is dubious, and it’s not clear that he had actually been scrutinizing Burisma at the time; U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said the probe had long been dormant.Ukraine’s current prosecutor general told Bloomberg he had no evidence of anything illegal or corrupt by either Joe or Hunter Biden.And just because Trump pushed for investigating the Bidens and withheld money doesn’t mean there is a provable quid pro quo.He has low approval ratings and trails most Democrats he potentially faces in 2020, including by double digits in the case of Biden.First of all, we need to get more details on exactly what went down — and how explicit or implicit any official actions by Trump might have been tied to Ukraine investigating the Bidens.Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said, “Understanding exactly what he said would be very helpful I think to determine whether the allegations, which are quite serious, are allegations that will have consequence.” Other Republicans and Trump Cabinet secretaries have suggested Trump’s allegations concerning the Bidens merit investigation, without weighing in on whether Trump’s specific pursuit was appropriate.You have seen news reports and the president’s personal lawyer confirm that the president has pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a political opponent of the president.Is it your understanding that Ukrainian aid was being held up to apply pressure to Ukraine to investigate actions relating to Biden or his son?Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has publicly urged the Ukrainians to pursue investigations that he has admitted would benefit Trump, and one in particular that could damage what appears to be Trump’s most threatening potential 2020 Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.In May, Giuliani canceled a controversial planned trip to Ukraine that he had admitted was intended to apply pressure on its government to investigate Biden’s son Hunter Biden and his work for a Ukrainian gas company that had previously been of interest to investigators in the country.Whether because of those details or because he knows what happened, Giuliani appeared on CNN on Thursday night and defended Trump as if there were some kind of a quid pro quo involving foreign aid and investigating the Bidens.“It is perfectly appropriate for [Trump] to ask a foreign government to investigate this massive crime that was made by a former vice president.”

AD

He tweeted the same sentiment shortly thereafter, despite the allegations involving the Bidens being highly speculative and far from proved.Maybe if Obama did that the Biden Family wouldn’t have bilked millions from Ukraine and billions from China; being covered up by a Corrupt Media.But during a CNN appearance Thursday night, Giuliani admitted that he spoke with Ukrainian officials about reopening an investigation Republicans think will make former vice president Joe Biden look bad.Biden leads in polls of the Democratic presidential candidates.Late Friday, The Post reported that Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden’s son in a call between the two leaders that is at the center of the complaint, according to two people familiar with the matter.… The Democrats’ investigation was launched earlier this month, before revelations that an intelligence official had lodged a complaint with the inspector general.”

-- Giuliani contradicted himself when asked whether he pressed the Ukrainian government to look into former vice president Joe Biden.And I’m proud of it,” Giuliani said, channeling his inner Nathan Jessup from “A Few Good Men.”

-- Perhaps more revealing, though, was when Cuomo asked Giuliani if Trump told the new Ukrainian president what he wanted done with investigations into Biden and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Maybe if Obama did that the Biden Family wouldn’t have bilked millions from Ukraine and billions from China; being covered up by a Corrupt Media.-- The Post’s Editorial Board reported on Sept. 5 that it had been “reliably told” that Trump was holding back military assistance for Ukraine (to defend itself against the revanchist Russia) in an attempt to force Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of Biden: “The strong-arming of Mr. Zelensky was openly reported to the New York Times last month by … Giuliani, who said he had met in Madrid with a close associate of the Ukrainian leader and urged that the new government restart an investigation of Mr. Biden and his son.Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, while Joe Biden, as vice president, urged the dismissal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor, who investigated the firm.” (The Post’s Fact Checker team scrutinized claims by Trump and Giuliani about Biden’s son and Ukraine in May.)— Michael McFaul (@McFaul) September 20, 2019

-- Joe Biden won endorsements from African American lawmakers and a former governor of Florida.From the AP: “The backing from Reps. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Charlie Crist of Florida reflects Biden’s play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary.This came before a Wall Street Journal report that in a single July conversation President Trump urged the Ukrainian leader to find dirt on his opponent Joe Biden.first, because it would involve the extortion of a foreign leader for personal and political gain; second, because it would involve the solicitation of a foreign government’s involvement in a U.S. election; and third, because it would involve the solicitation of a foreign government’s investigation of a political opponent in a fashion that grossly violates the civil liberties of a U.S. person, namely Biden’s son.”

Republicans — any member of Congress and any Cabinet member — must be asked in any media or congressional appearance whether the “threat of withholding congressionally authorized funds to — in the Post’s words — ‘extort’ a foreign leader into investigating a domestic political opponent and his family” is impeachable.AD

President Trump's attorney says he had spoken with a Ukrainian official about Joe Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who investigated Biden's son.The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post reported Trump pressed Ukraine’s leader to investigate former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter, who has ties to a Ukrainian energy company.We also know this: As he admitted Thursday night on CNN, the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has been trying to persuade the Ukrainian government to investigate, among other things, one of Trump’s potential Democratic opponents, former vice president Joe Biden, and Biden’s son Hunter about the latter’s involvement with a Ukrainian gas company.The whistleblower is “a punk, a punk who’s snitching out the president’s phone calls to a foreign leader,” said Fox News correspondent Geraldo Rivera on Friday’s episode of “Fox & Friends,” adding that the person is one of “these, you know, deep state people.”

AD

AD

The phone call at the center of the extraordinary complaint involved Trump’s pressing the leader of Ukraine to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, two people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post this week.Trump has been reluctant, and he pressed Zelensky about Biden in a July phone conversation that is the subject of an extraordinary intelligence community whistleblower complaint.The second matter raised by Giuliani involved a probe of the Ukrainian gas tycoon who put Hunter Biden on the board of his company Burisma.In 2016, then-Vice President Biden demanded the ouster of Ukraine’s top law enforcement official, Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.AD

Trump and Giuliani have accused the elder Biden of pushing for Shokin’s dismissal to protect Hunter Biden from an investigation into Burisma.“The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,” Trump wrote Saturday on Twitter.Biden said Saturday that he had never spoken with his son about his business in Ukraine and accused Trump of “doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum.”The September survey is the first by the Register in the 2020 cycle not to put Biden in the lead in the first-in-the-nation contest, which will take place in February.A Monmouth University poll released last month suggested the addition of an option to participate over the phone, rather than attending an hours-long meeting in the biting cold, would have expanded support for Biden.In this edition: A wild Iowa weekend, the Trump administration's Biden gambit, and the end of the de Blasio dream.Even before the release of the Des Moines Register's Selzer & Co. poll, which put Warren at 22 percent support to Joe Biden's 20 percent, the senator from Massachusetts had reshaped the Democratic primary.On Aug. 20, Biden's campaign joined in.“The satellite caucuses will create one additional county in each Congressional District.”

The new system will (unless it changes again) work quasi-absentee votes into the caucus count; it won’t create a separate, online pool of votes for a “virtual caucus.” The few polls conducted of that “virtual” contest found Joe Biden, who’s more popular with moderates than liberals, doing very well.“Young black voters to their Biden-supporting parents: ‘Is this your king?’ “ by Astead W.

After the first reports that the president might have pressured Ukraine's president to get dirt on his son, Joe Biden told reporters that Trump should “start to be the president” and stop abusing his powers.The next day, at the steak fry, Biden took a question from a Fox News reporter — how many times had he talked to Hunter Biden about his “overseas business” dealings?Biden said he’d never talked to him about it, then let rip.“I know Trump deserves to be investigated,” Biden.You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate him, if that’s what happened?” After accusing the president of “abuse of power” and saying he’d “beat him like a drum,” Biden was asked whether the president should be impeached: “Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached, but I’m not making that judgment right now.”

Both the Friday and Saturday exchanges with reporters came from the same premise: Biden, campaigning to restore the pre-Trump norms of good government, was saying that Trump was breaking those norms to smear him.Other candidates might get into the mix with the president, but Biden has positioned himself as a back-to-normalcy candidate: “America is coming back like it used to be,” like he said when he launched.On Sunday, Trump said without evidence that “Biden and his son” were adding to “the corruption already in the Ukraine,” then taunted Biden for saying he had not spoken to his son: “Of course you spoke to your son!” Later, on talk shows, the president’s surrogates inside and outside the administration, who have brushed aside questions about actions of the president’s kin, advanced the completely unproved accusations of Biden family corruption.“If it's the case that there was something going on with the president or his family that caused a conflict of interest and Vice President Biden behaved in a way that was inconsistent with the way leaders ought to operate, I think the American people deserve to know that,” said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.“I think the bigger story here is really what went on with Biden and his son?” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on “Meet the Press” on Sunday.Yet the facts are his son said they had spoken.” And Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney, went even further, going on Fox News to call Hunter Biden a “recovering drug addict” and stoke speculation that his deals in Ukraine were subjects for the former vice president to answer.Clinton was hamstrung by the impression that she could not be trusted, and both she and Trump lurched into Election Day with most voters saying that they found neither of them to be “honest and trustworthy.”

Biden, after a lifetime in politics, does not have a similar image.Democrats were largely united around Hillary Clinton when Trump made his 2016 attacks; they are not united behind Biden.Biden hadn't called for impeachment, only investigation.Attacking Biden could backfire and rally Democrats around him.And there are other reasons so many candidates in the doldrums see a potential comeback if the race keeps shuffling and if Joe Biden — the only top candidate not running from the left — loses more support.(NBC-WSJ, 900 registered voters)

There is no evidence that Biden played any role in election interference efforts by foreign governments in 2016.Since the spring, Rudolph W.

In meetings overseas with Ukrainian officials, Giuliani has pushed for reopening an investigation of Burisma Holdings, the gas company that hired Hunter Biden in 2014 to serve as a board member and adviser while his father was U.S. vice president.In 2016, then-Vice President Biden traveled to Ukraine to push for the country to sack its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.On that trip, Biden said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Shokin was removed.Biden’s push was part of a broader international effort to fight corruption in Ukraine, and Shokin had been accused of ignoring major corruption.Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called for the Justice Department to play a role in the matter, arguing that it should “look at the Biden-Ukraine connection, like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,” in a reference to Mueller’s Russia probe.“What relationships, if any, did the Biden world have to the Ukraine?“We’ve been very weak.”

House Democrats already are probing whether Trump and Giuliani withheld U.S. assistance to the Ukrainian government until it agreed to investigate possible corruption involving Biden and his son Hunter.Giuliani said new scrutiny of Trump’s communications with Zelensky is welcome because it draws attention to Biden and his family’s involvement in Ukraine.“I’m just doing my job as a poor, simple, little defense lawyer who’s defending his client.”

“That is clearly wrong and clearly an abuse of power,” added Burns, who is informally advising Biden on foreign policy.However, with the allegations (and virtual public confession) that Trump went to a foreign power, Ukraine, to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden, his most likely opponent, and may even have extorted Ukraine using taxpayer money, the calculus may change, dramatically so.From factually specific news reports (e.g., confirming Trump asked the Ukrainian president eight times to find dirt on Biden), we know the proof and the witnesses are out there.In New Hampshire, where Sanders defeated Clinton by 22 points but is now in close competition with Warren and Biden, Sanders recently changed state directors.Ours is.”

Trump suggested Sunday that he mentioned Biden and his son Hunter in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Many have surmised that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Bidens by threatening to withhold U.S. military and financial aid.One energy company, Burisma, hired several well-connected Democrats, including Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, who became a board member in 2014.The younger Biden didn’t provide direct support to politicians.AD

Trump on Sunday acknowledged raising the Bidens with Zelensky.“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters.Hunter Biden is no longer on the Burisma payroll.The tweets came after a full day of attacks against the Democratic presidential nominee by Trump administration officials and allies who demanded investigations of Biden and his son Hunter despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing, as The Washington Post’s Seung Min Kim and Felicia Sonmez reported.Trump repeated those claims on Sunday night, again without any evidence, writing, “Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son’s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine.”

President Trump is under fire for having repeatedly raised Joe Biden, a possible opponent in the 2020 presidential race, in a July conversation with Ukraine’s president at a time when the struggling nation expected to receive military aid for its nascent war against Russia on its eastern border.The Trump White House appears to be counting on that confusion to offer a fog of claims and allegations to make it appear as if Biden had done something wrong.On top of that, Trump is arguing that because Biden said he withheld aid from Ukraine in the name of battling corruption, there’s nothing wrong with Trump withholding aid from the same country in the name of fighting corruption (i.e., Biden was involved in supposedly corrupt dealings and should be investigated).“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters.In fact, Biden’s case has gotten stronger with time.Trump has claimed that Biden in 2015 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating a Ukrainian gas producer, Burisma Holdings, that had added Biden’s son Hunter to its board.But it turns out that the investigation had already been shelved when Biden acted and may have even involved a side company, not Burisma.The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and “Joe Biden’s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,” said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms.Moreover, Yuri Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.Biden lied about talking to his son

Biden told reporters that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings.“Of course you spoke to your son.”

In July, in a profile of Hunter Biden in the New Yorker, Hunter described one brief exchange with his father on the issue.In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma.Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board.We will leave it to readers to decide, but it’s a thin reed on which to hang the label of “lie.” In any case, Biden never said he spoke to his son, as Trump claimed he did.AD

Biden was ‘disgraceful’ when he bragged about holding back the funds

Trump is referring to a 2018 appearance by Biden before the Council on Foreign Relations.Here’s what Biden said:

AD

“I remember going over, convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees.And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

Biden is certainly being self-congratulatory here.But, as noted, Biden’s action was coordinated with other major players in the region and celebrated at the time because Shokin was widely seen as a failure.Bloomberg reported that “the U.S. plan to push for Shokin’s dismissal didn’t initially come from Biden, but rather filtered up from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.” In the same month Biden traveled to Ukraine, Bloomberg also reported, “hundreds of Ukrainians demonstrated outside President Petro Poroshenko’s office demanding Shokin’s resignation, and he was dismissed.”

AD

“This decision creates an opportunity to make a fresh start in the prosecutor general’s office.The statement decried the “lack of tangible results of investigations into serious cases.”

AD

It’s unclear when exactly this conversation took place but it appears to have been during a visit by Biden to Ukraine in December, 2015, when he spoke to the Parliament and decried the “cancer of corruption” in the country.Shokin was removed from office in mid-March and Biden and Poroshenko announced on April 15 the loan guarantee would go forward; the agreement between the United States and Ukraine was signed on June 3.Biden’s account to the Council on Foreign Relations appears to squeeze months of negotiations into a few hours.The big news this weekend was that Warren had overtaken Biden (albeit still within the margin of error) in the new poll.The good news for her is she seems to be doing that, at least in Iowa, where she’s tied with Biden at 22 percent with electability-first voters.Is Joe Biden’s electability edge ironclad?AD

But just as we should challenge our assumptions about Warren’s electability deficit, we should challenge them about Biden’s electability edge.Part of that is because Biden is the most well-known candidate in the race who is also easiest to see in the role of a president — in large part because he was right next to one for eight years.Biden’s previous presidential runs haven’t gone well, and there have already been plenty of stumbles early in his 2020 campaign.Is Biden’s black support sustainable?A big reason Biden continues to lead in national polling — even as he doesn’t do as well in Iowa and New Hampshire — is black voters.AD

As Philip Bump has written, black voters may not be the silver bullet for Biden that they were for Clinton.He dismissed as “speculation” reporting by The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal that Trump pressed his counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden.(“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters.)And Mnuchin said it was “inappropriate” that Biden’s son, Hunter, “did very significant business dealings in Ukraine” while his father was in office, laying out a standard that the Trump family is currently violating, as CNN's “State of the Union” host Jake Tapper pointed out during their interview.Not to be outdone, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared at another G.M.Trump used his meetings with heads of state to flay Biden, celebrate his personal attorney’s altercations and tend to his media feuds.For instance, he argued during a sit-down with the Polish president that if Biden were a Republican, the news media would have him in “the electric chair by right now.”

Trump’s head-turning visit to the United Nations came as scrutiny of his conversation with Zelensky intensifies in Washington.He again admitted that he raised the Biden allegations in his call with Zelensky.Echoing language he used to dismiss the Russia investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the former special counsel, Trump called the Ukraine development another “Democratic witch hunt,” and said any problematic dealings with Ukraine were done by Biden.AD

“The one who’s got the problem is Biden,” Trump said.Trump denied that he explicitly withheld $250 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless its government launched a probe into the Biden family.Despite the peril the Ukrainian episode presents for his presidency, Trump seemed to revel in the opportunity to kick up dust around Biden, who has led Trump in virtually every public poll for several months.Trump is attempting to sully one of Biden’s calling cards in the 2020 campaign: His pledge to honor the rule of law and to restore moral integrity and ethics to the Oval Office.Trump is trying to portray Biden as corrupt and deny him this signature issue.Within Trump’s orbit, some argue that the Ukraine news cycle will ultimately benefit the president — if he and his allies can redirect the public’s attention to what they claim is unethical behavior by Biden and his son Hunter.AD

“We know that Hunter Biden had a sweetheart gig in Ukraine and that Joe Biden has bragged about trying to fire Ukraine’s top prosecutor looking into corruption,” Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a written statement.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.In private talking points that the Republican National Committee sent out to surrogates Monday morning, the committee reiterates Trump’s claim that his conversations with Zelensky were “totally appropriate” — and then offers a half-dozen unflattering claims about Biden and Ukraine.But the president tweeted about Ukraine and Biden on his way into that event, calling those who question his conduct “stone cold Crooked” and questioning the patriotism of the “so-called whistleblower.’”

Trump kept up the theme when he met with Polish President Andrzej Duda.“Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, all right?” Trump added.If that ever happened — if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now.But the scandal around Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden — and his administration’s seemingly illegal coverup of the whistleblower complaint, which is said to involve that pressure — throws the untenable nature of that endgame into even sharper relief.Trump has now openly allowed that his call with the Ukrainian president was about how “we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

The fact that Trump appears to have withheld military aid to Ukraine while demanding that it investigate his most likely general election opponent — even as his administration is violating the law by withholding an “urgent” and “credible” whistleblower complaint from Congress that appears to involve this matter — has combined to exert a new level of pressure on top Democrats.Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has admitted that Trump has signed off on his ongoing pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden, saying: “I don’t do anything that involves my client without speaking to my client.”

AD

You don’t need an explicit quid pro quo for this to be extraordinarily serious.Trump appeared to confirm Sunday as he spoke with reporters that he mentioned Joe and Hunter Biden in the phone call with Zelensky — though he insisted he has done nothing improper.Trump has repeatedly raised the specter of impropriety on the part of Biden, whose son Hunter was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that Trump pushed Zelensky to investigate, according to people familiar with the matter.In fact, Biden’s case has gotten stronger with time.[President] Trump has claimed that Biden in 2016 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating a Ukrainian gas producer, Burisma Holdings, that had added Biden’s son Hunter to its board.But it turns out that the investigation had already been shelved when Biden acted and may have even involved a side company, not Burisma.The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and “Joe Biden’s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,” said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms.Moreover, Yuri Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.Reporting suggests that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden multiple times in a phone call in July, a demand that apparently was part of a still-secret whistleblower complaint targeting Trump’s administration.He then went on a brief, angry riff about the media and about Biden and his son Hunter Biden.“And they know about corruption, and they probably know that Joe Biden and his son are corrupt.Joe Biden and his son are corrupt.Trump’s assertion that Biden is corrupt stems from his misrepresentation or misunderstanding of a request Biden made publicly as vice president.In late 2015, Ukraine was under pressure to take a firmer stand against corruption, and Biden joined other international actors in advocating change.But, as the New York Times reported at the time, “the credibility of the vice president’s anticorruption message may have been undermined” by Hunter Biden’s relationship with a Ukrainian energy company.That company, Trump and his allies insist, was under investigation by the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, and they accuse Biden of advocating Shokin’s firing to protect Hunter Biden.Trump is insistent on the point, though, and tries to blur the line between what Biden did and what Trump did.Trump is framing Biden’s pressure on Ukraine in a way that makes it appear to mirror what he himself is accused of.Talking to reporters while sitting next to Polish President Andrzej Duda, Trump escalated his attacks on Biden.“If that ever happened — if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now,” Trump claimed.AD

In fact, Trump has tried to claim that his conversation with Zelensky was an echo of exactly what Biden actually did.AD

This is actually what Biden’s focus was.The prosecutor was fired and a new one put into place — who himself eventually investigated the company for which Hunter Biden had done work.AD

Trump claims that Biden made that demand to protect his son, an assertion of corruption for which there’s no evidence.Trump is making that claim, meanwhile, to paper over what’s been reported: that the demand Trump made in his phone call was less about “talking corruption” than trying to gin up some statement from Ukraine that what Biden did was actually corrupt.Trump says Biden did what Trump is accused of doing; Trump claims innocence by saying he only did what the best available evidence suggests Biden had actually done.With that in the rearview mirror, Trump then reportedly embarked on an effort to do something remarkably similar to one of the worst-case allegations in the Russia probe: seek electoral assistance from a foreign nation in the form of dirt on Biden, now a presidential candidate.Sure, there’s the Biden angle and everything else.“President Trump suggested Sunday that he mentioned former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter in a phone call with the leader of Ukraine, as Democrats ramp up their calls for accountability amid swirling questions about whether Trump sought to use his influence to seek reelection help from a foreign country.”

In private, do the super-progressive candidates confess that a public option is the only feasible approach?“Two-thirds of all voters — 67 percent — and 78 percent of Democrats back an optional program that would allow those under 65 to buy into Medicare just like one can currently buy in to private insurance.”

His team might confess that this is just the thing to light a fire under former vice president Joe Biden.Biden, of course, leads the field in the Democratic primary to face Trump in next year’s general election.The investigation Trump wanted to see was meant to focus on Biden’s push in late 2015 to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor who’d earned the ire of U.S. and international officials for turning a blind eye to corruption.Trump and his allies claim without evidence that Biden advocated for the prosecutor’s firing because the prosecutor may have been investigating a company on whose board Hunter Biden sat.Joe Biden is the real wrongdoer

Biden has been the most common target of Trump’s defenders and of Trump himself.AD

“They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal.” @PeterSchweizer The problem is, “Trump” did nothing wrong!On Sunday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” Pompeo, a stalwart defender of his boss, suggested that the situation was indeed not complicated: Biden did something wrong.AD

“If there was election interference that took place by the vice president, I think the American people deserve to know,” Pompeo said, referring to Biden — and echoing the questions that have lingered around Trump’s 2016 victory since before his presidency began.“We know there was interference in the 2016 election and if it’s the case that there was something going on with the President or his family that caused a conflict of interest and Vice President Biden behaved in a way that was inconsistent with the way leaders ought to operate, I think the American people deserve to know that.”

Axios noted how Trump’s most fervent media defender, Fox News, positioned the story Sunday, compared with MSNBC.MSNBC noted how Trump was trying to shift questions onto Biden — and Fox embraced that precise shift.The suggestion Nunes made wasn’t only that Biden was culpable but, indeed, that he was already paying a political cost for being so deeply mired in this controversy.AD

AD

“These stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,” Nunes said.And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign.I really do... his lead is basically down to zero.”

The allegation that Biden did something wrong in December 2015 didn’t originate with an effort by Hillary Clinton to keep Biden out of the race, given that he announced he wasn’t running that year in October 2015.The central problem with the Biden-did-wrong theory is a dearth of evidence that Biden did anything wrong.While it’s easy to see how Biden’s demands about the Ukrainian prosecutor could be spun as an effort to aid his son, there has been no evidence to emerge that Hunter Biden’s role was the motivation for that firing, that Biden acted alone in making the demand, that he knew of an investigation or that an investigation into the company even existed.Hunter Biden is the real wrongdoer

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin marched boldly into a minefield while talking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday.AD

“What I do find inappropriate is the fact that Vice President Biden at the time’s son did very significant business dealings in Ukraine,” Mnuchin said of the controversy.“So it is okay for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump Jr. to do business all over the world, it’s okay for Ivanka Trump to have copyrights approved all over the world while President Trump is president, but while Vice President Joe Biden was vice president, his son shouldn’t have been able to do business dealings?”

AD

Mnuchin stumbled.“Again, I think there is a significant difference in what you’re saying, okay, or what I was saying between Biden and his son’s relationship with the Ukraine oligarch,” Mnuchin said, “and potential business dealings that the Trump Organization has had which predated his presidency.”

That can be a subtle distinction.AD

AD

Trump Jr., meanwhile, expressed his own support for the idea that Hunter Biden had acted inappropriately, favoriting a tweet criticizing Hunter Biden’s having apparently profited from his father’s name.And, as above, there’s no evidence that Hunter Biden’s role prompted Biden’s demands.“I like Joe Biden.The prosecutor was looking at things in the Ukraine, and he got fired, and there’s all kind of allegations about the Ukraine dumping information into the legal system and political system in 2016 about Manafort and others, you know, Hunter Biden, what kind of situation did he have financially?He later tweeted “breaking news” to that effect, spinning things back to Biden once again.JAKE TAPPER: If the president did, in fact, in that phone call push the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden and Joe Biden eight times, as The Wall Street Journal reported, is it an impeachable offense, in your view?“No, I didn’t,” Trump said when asked whether he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he would obtain $250 million in stalled U.S. aid only if he agreed to investigate the Bidens.Slamming the former vice president for doing what he said was a “very, very bad thing,” Trump added: “I didn’t do it … when you see the call [transcript], you’re going to be very surprised.”

Trump’s comments came a day after he appeared to confirm that he mentioned Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in the call with Zelensky.They argued that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, “now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.”

Since spring, Giuliani has pushed the Ukrainians to investigate a gas tycoon who had Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma Holdings starting in 2014.According to the New York Times, Hunter Biden was paid as much as $50,000 some months for his work.The organization accused Trump and Giuliani of illegally soliciting a political contribution from Zelensky and Ukranian officials by allegedly urging them to investigate Biden.He made no mention of Trump’s alleged actions but argued that the Senate Intelligence Committee should be allowed to deal with the matter “in a secure setting with adequate protections in a bipartisan fashion.”

Trump has repeatedly raised the specter of impropriety on the part of Biden and his son, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that Trump pushed Zelensky to investigate, according to people familiar with the matter.Questioned by reporters during a one-on-one meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda earlier Monday, Trump insisted that he “put no pressure on them whatsoever,” as public scrutiny continued to mount on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky during which Trump purportedly pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens.And he escalated his attacks on Biden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.“If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair right now,” Trump said.One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption, so it’s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.”

Trump said that he is not worried about impeachment and that “the one who’s got the problem is Biden.”

“What Biden did is a disgrace,” Trump said.In 2016, then-Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Ukraine to push for the firing of its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.On that trip, Biden said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Shokin was removed.AD

Biden’s push was part of a broader international effort to fight corruption in Ukraine, and Shokin had been accused of ignoring major misconduct.AD

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who met with Zelensky in Ukraine in early September, said Monday that the Ukrainian president directly expressed concern that military aid was being cut off to his country by Trump as “a consequence” of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens.This, again, is an issue of solemn obligation.”

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Monday that the actions by Biden merit more scrutiny but also urged Trump to release more details about his call with Zelensky.In an exchange with reporters outside the White House on Sunday before departing for events in Texas and Ohio, Trump appeared to suggest that he did speak about Biden with Zelensky.“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump said.“And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

At The White House

THE LATEST ON UKRAINE: President Trump admitted yesterday that he mentioned former vice president Joe Biden during a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Refresher: The Post first reported last week that Trump pressured Zelensky on the call to investigate a gas company with ties to Hunter Biden — the subject of a whistleblower’s complaint.“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters.“And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

Later on in the day, Trump told reporters in Houston that he'd “have the right” to mention Biden's name with Zelensky and that he'd “love” to release a transcript of the call: “I’m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son … Joe’s got a lot of problems.But what he said was a terrible thing,” suggesting Biden had lied about communications with his son about Ukraine.”

“I’m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son … Joe’s got a lot of problems.But what he said was a terrible thing,” suggesting Biden had lied about communications with his son about Ukraine.” Reminder: There is no evidence that Biden committed any wrongdoing.Full-court press: Trump's admission came hours after senior members of his administration pulled off a full-court press on the Sunday shows, arguing they supported investigating whether Biden may have participated in “corrupt” behavior.… If there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know,” Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I would say these are confidential discussions between two foreign leaders but I think the bigger issue is Biden came out this weekend saying he never had any discussions with his son.His son came out and said he had had business discussions with his father so I think that the real issue is not what the president said, but what, indeed, did Biden’s son do,” Mnuchin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

You are reading the Power Up newsletter.THE BIG IDEA: House Democrats sound increasingly inclined to move toward impeaching President Trump after he appeared to confirm Sunday that he mentioned Joe Biden and his son Hunter during a summer phone call with the new leader of Ukraine.“Critical for the facts to come out.”

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, during a single call, the president urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “about eight times” to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on a probe that could hamper Biden’s 2020 campaign.On Sunday morning, Trump appeared to say that he brought up Biden with Zelensky.“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House.After Mnuchin criticized Hunter Biden for doing business in Ukraine, he got mealy-mouthed when CNN’s Jake Tapper asked if that means he thinks it’s not okay for Don Jr. and Eric Trump to do business all over the world and for Ivanka Trump to get copyrights approved by foreign governments.“The president and his close allies also escalated their attacks on Biden on Sunday, demanding probes into the former vice president and his son’s work in Ukraine, though no evidence has surfaced that Biden acted inappropriately and Trump’s allies did not provide any,” Seung Min Kim and Felicia Sonmez report.Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called for the Justice Department to play a role in the matter, arguing that it should ‘look at the Biden-Ukraine connection, like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,’ in a reference to Mueller’s Russia probe.… On Sunday, Giuliani attacked Joe Biden in deeply personal terms by referencing Hunter Biden’s struggles with addiction.‘The kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict,’ Giuliani said on ‘Fox News Sunday.’” (Our fact checker team this morning challenges the latest claims by Trump and his team about Biden and Ukraine.)… Twenty-two percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers say Warren is their first choice for president, compared with 20% for Biden and 11% for [Bernie Sanders].“ Biden has fallen from 32% last December to 20% today.Biden also faces questions about his fitness for the job.Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “On Thursday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told Detroit autoworkers they should be rewarded for making concessions ‘when this company was in some bad straits.’ On Sunday, Biden spoke to a local union in Kansas City, Kan., and [Warren] picketed with workers in Detroit.“This is a head-shaking moment for me, that Republicans don’t give a damn about the national security of this country and are willing to let the president get away with this fundamental corruption.”

AD

He added: “If that’s the direction they take — attacking the whistleblower, trying to cover up this corruption — it’s a really, really sad day for the country.”

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) mainly kept his focus on Biden, but he also suggested that Trump should release more details about his call with Zelensky.“And, of course, transparency is always the best policy so long as we don’t endanger national security.”

Later, in an exchange with reporters, Grassley declined to say whether he believes it is appropriate that Trump brought up Biden in his phone call with Zelensky.AD

AD

“You know, what you’re asking me, you could ask me the same question about — was it appropriate what Biden did?You ought to ask the same at the same time,” Grassley said, echoing Trump’s attacks against Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that Trump pushed Zelensky to investigate.“And I very much appreciate the fact that the chairman has decided that the entire committee should be briefed, not just the chairman and vice chairman.”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, said he believes Trump was wrong to have raised Biden in his call with Zelensky.But he dismissed calls for the president’s impeachment and said that so far no evidence has emerged of a quid pro quo offer by Trump of military aid in exchange for investigating Biden.“He simply raised the issue of Biden, and I don’t believe he should have done it,” Rubio said.But the Ukrainians’ need for U.S. support was ongoing, as Trump well knew when he dispatched Rudolph W. Giuliani to pressure them to dig up dirt on Joe Biden’s son.He can make wild, unfounded accusations about Biden or anyone else, and those accusations will be repeated and spread, with factual corrections left for the 12th paragraph or a fact-check most people won’t read.Trump, according to two people familiar with the matter, repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, in relation to work he did for a company in that country.AD

Trump has flirted publicly with releasing a transcript of his call with Zelensky, and he has seemed to confirm reporting that they talked about the investigation of Biden’s son.AD

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” the president said Sunday.David Kris, a former Justice Department national security official and co-founder of the Culper Partners consulting firm, said that while case law on the issue was murky, the Justice Department would be on “terribly weak ground” if Trump was pressing his counterpart on Biden.In a time of “overt racism,” she presented herself “as only the second black woman elected to the United States Senate and as a serious and top-tier candidate for the president of the United States.”

Because the law defines bribery as the giving or taking of a thing of value for the purpose of influencing an official’s actions, “the issue would be whether the promise to investigate [Biden’s son] Hunter Biden was a thing of value that was offered and accepted,” Grewal said.“Some people will say it’s an intangible with no obvious value, and others will say it’s evidently a thing of value to kneecap your opponent.”

Trump’s apparent acknowledgment Sunday that he discussed Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine with the Ukrainian president has spurred a new wave of allegations that Trump crossed a line in that phone call.Trump’s first day at the U.N. General Assembly was overshadowed by the burgeoning controversy over the president’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his family.AD

AD

There’s also this: On Sunday, without admitting that he tried to encourage Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, Trump acknowledged discussing the former vice president and his son Hunter during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the context of “the corruption already in the Ukraine.” It was classic Trump.In the wake of reporting that Trump encouraged the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — the leading contender to face Trump in next year’s presidential race — there has been renewed energy on the left to move forward with an impeachment vote.No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!On that call, Trump allegedly asked Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president and possible 2020 opponent Joe Biden, according to an intelligence official turned whistleblower who reported the call to the intelligence community inspector general.The lawyer, Andrew Bakaj, wrote that his client had reported an “urgent concern” to the intelligence community inspector general on Aug. 12, “through the established procedures promulgated by law.”

AD

AD

Trump has suggested he did bring up Biden during the call, but he has dismissed allegations of anything untoward.There was no pressure applied, nothing.”

Trump repeated his contention that Joe Biden is the one who should be investigated.The president and his allies have accused Biden of pressuring Ukraine in 2016 to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to benefit his son.AD

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.At the time that then-Vice President Joe Biden sought the ouster of the top Ukrainian prosecutor, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.“The only way they can try is through impeachment.”

Nearly every poll has Biden defeating Trump nationwide and in battleground states.So, it’s okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it’s not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?AD

AD

And then there is Joe Biden.According to the New York Times, “Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden … who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.” The Post reports that it is “unclear how seriously Shokin — who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall — was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out.” But what is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: “I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours.He got fired.”

This weekend, Biden told reporters, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.” That is flatly untrue.Hunter admitted in an interview with the New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’” Moreover, the New Yorker reports that, “In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma.Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden.” That same month, the New York Times published an article about how Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine undermined the vice president’s anti-corruption message, which quoted a Biden spokesman saying it had no impact.So, Biden was fully aware of his son’s involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016.Federal ethics regulations require “all employees to recuse themselves from participating in an official matter if their impartiality would be questioned.” Biden violated these rules.AD

AD

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, “It’s time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president.” Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president.It will keep the story of Biden’s conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election.Millions of Americans will learn the word “Burisma.” Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides such as Hochstein to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.Hunter Biden had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas.And the focus will not just be on Ukraine but also how, as The Post reported, “for more than two decades, [Hunter’s] professional work often tracked with his father’s life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China.” Trump will use an investigation to paint Joe Biden as a creature of the Washington swamp who used his official position to enrich his son.While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need.The irony is the Democrats’ investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump.Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani have mounted a sustained public campaign for Ukraine to investigate a convoluted story in which Biden, as vice president, supposedly pressed for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating a company on whose board Biden’s son sat.The emerging spin from Trump’s propagandists is that Trump didn’t “pressure” Zelensky to dig dirt on Biden and that there was no explicit quid pro quo involving the military aid.AD

May 19: Trump goes on Fox News and rails about Biden and Ukraine, falsely claiming that Biden improperly pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was supposedly “after” his son.Trump himself will later admit he brought up Biden and “corruption” in Ukraine.AD

Late July: A few days after that call, Giuliani meets with an aide to Zelensky, and demands an investigation into Biden.Murphy has since characterized their conversation by saying that Zelensky was concerned about the cutoff of aid, and that he heard from Ukrainian officials who worried about whether it was a “consequence” of failing to probe Biden.AD

Sept. 19: Giuliani first denies to CNN that he is pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, before reversing and confirming as much.Sept. 22: Trump confirms he brought up Biden and corruption in the call with Zelensky, but top administration officials deny Trump “pressured” him to investigate Biden.So here’s what we know: As the timeline shows, Trump was thinking hard about Biden and Ukraine well in advance of ordering the aid frozen.Both Trump and Giuliani have openly flaunted their own efforts to get Ukraine to dig dirt on Biden.“Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.”...

Pelosi’s change of heart comes after days of consulting allies and follows reports that Trump may have pressured a foreign leader to investigate former vice president and potential 2020 campaign rival Joe Biden and his family.Even though Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have each admitted to discussing the Biden investigation with the Ukraine, few Republican lawmakers have even expressed concern over Trump’s behavior.— Former vice president Joe Biden, in remarks at a town hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Sept. 20, 2019

A confused reader passed along a tweet with a clip of these remarks.What was Biden talking about?Yet Biden suggests the plan would raise deductibles.AD

Biden’s staff acknowledges that he misspoke, repeatedly, in this passage:

Biden has rejected a single-payer approach and advocated building on the Affordable Care Act, the law expanding health-care access passed during the Obama administration.Biden, by contrast, only focuses on the cost of tax increase (apparently because polling has found that it’s a way to undercut support for Medicare-for-all).In the debate, Biden argued that a three-person family earning $60,000 a year will face more than $5,000 in taxes — the 4 percent premium tax ($1,240 after the standard deduction) and the 7.5 percent tax paid by employers ($4,500), on the widely accepted economic theory that payroll taxes paid by employers are passed onto employees.AD

“Vice President Biden’s priority as president will be to make sure every single American has access to affordable, quality health insurance in the quickest, most cost-effective way possible,” Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said.It’s a classic political gambit to focus on only half the equation, and we will keep an eye on how Biden frames this in the future to see if he merits Pinocchios.She stays focused instead on an overall reduction in costs, clearly not wanting to engage in a debate on Biden’s playing field.AD

As he arrived at the United Nations on Tuesday, Trump was engulfed by questions about why he withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for the small Eastern European democracy at least a week before a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump is said to have raised the idea of launching a probe into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.They wrote that if the latest allegations involving Ukraine are true, “we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.”

The Post then published this story confirming that the president personally ordered almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine — which Congress had appropriated — to be withheld, just a week before he had his now-infamous phone call in which he urged the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son.Biden’s the one who ought to be investigated!, some say.Because that was Trump’s initial explanation for why he pressured the Ukrainian president to look into Biden.But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, the campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis.AD

The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her.But that’s life when you’re dealing with Donald Trump.”

Biden has been buffeted in recent weeks by a flood of claims on social media seeking to weaponize his debate misstatements and other verbal miscues.The assertion that Biden behaved corruptly when it came to Ukraine marked a significant escalation by Trump and his allies to elevate what are unsubstantiated claims into a dangerous threat to the 76-year-old’s candidacy.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.AD

Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.AD

Trump has suggested that Biden improperly used his influence as vice president, and the president appeared to confirm on Sunday that he raised the matter in a July phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Trump took his attacks even further on Monday — without proof — after Biden told Trump to release the transcript of his calls with Ukraine.AD

“Joe Biden and his son are corrupt.He added: “If that ever happened — if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now.”

AD

While Clinton initially ignored escalating conspiracy theories, Biden’s campaign has mobilized its research team, attempting to find ways to combat false charges and return the focus to Trump.They point to polls repeatedly showing Biden defeating Trump and say he has rattled the incumbent president.“In an outrageous and unprecedented act of corruption — and at the expense of our national security priorities — Donald Trump pressured a foreign country to smear the Democratic candidate he’s most afraid of facing next November,” said Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesman.For the sake of our democracy, it is also incumbent on the press to finally internalize the lessons of 2016 and dispense with the uncritical repetition of wholesale lies simply because Donald Trump says them.”

AD

Biden, at a fundraiser in Iowa on Saturday, said the president’s behavior was troubling.“The more he thinks he’s likely to lose, the more erratic he becomes and the more things he does that are worrisome,” Biden said.AD

Over the weekend, the Biden campaign and Trump released dueling videos on Twitter that underscored the social media imbalance Democrats are fighting.Trump’s video was viewed about 2.7 million times — nearly five times more than Biden’s video.George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who was sentenced to prison last year for lying to the FBI, sent a tweet Friday night spreading another unfounded allegation against Biden — and it got more retweets than the video posted at the top of Biden’s official Twitter account.Conservative social media influencers Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known as Diamond and Silk, weighed in on Friday evening, with their post gaining thousands of shares hours before Biden’s campaign had put out anything more than a plain statement on the platform addressing Trump’s phone call.said Saturday as he trailed Biden into the grounds of the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines.They’d blame her a little bit even though they thought Trump was being unfair.”

Biden in June issued a promise not to use false or purloined information and called on other candidates to do the same.From staunch Biden allies to rivals for the Democratic nomination, there wasn’t a clear sense of how to maneuver tactically to quiet Trump’s megaphone or come up with a counternarrative.Speaking to reporters in New York on Monday, Trump denied that he had offered military aid to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky only if the country launched a probe into Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Trump told his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before the call in which Trump is said to have pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, according to three senior administration officials.“President Trump made it clear that we’ve got to see reforms.”

AD

“He mentioned Vice President Biden and his son in the context of us wanting to see honest government,” Pence continued.“That’s exactly what the American taxpayer would expect.”

Echoing Trump’s comment hours earlier, Pence insisted “there was no quid pro quo” regarding an investigation of the Bidens and military aid.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.AD

Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases — at one point, threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees.Biden, who spoke for several minutes and left without taking questions, said that if Trump doesn’t comply with Congress, it will be forced to begin impeachment hearings.“But a tragedy of his own making.”

Biden’s remarks — his most extensive on the topic since news emerged last week that a whistleblower raised alarm about Trump’s request for an investigation into Biden — came on an extraordinary day of developments.Soon after Biden spoke, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, effectively moving beyond Biden’s demands.Biden’s remarks stopped short of asking for impeachment proceedings to begin now — a position that many of his Democratic presidential rivals arrived at months ago — and were largely consistent with his past statements.AD

AD

The latest moves stemmed from a decision by a whistleblower within the intelligence community to file a complaint alleging that Trump had asked for an investigation of the Bidens during a July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Trump, who had put a hold on military aid for Ukraine about a week before the call, allegedly brought up Biden’s role in pressing for the firing of a top prosecutor in Ukraine in 2016.Biden’s son Hunter sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been investigated by the prosecutor.Biden’s effort to get the prosecutor removed, however, was related to the Obama administration’s belief that the prosecutor was ineffective at rooting out corruption in Ukraine.The tentative nature of Biden’s remarks underscored the difficulty in predicting how the coming national maelstrom will affect his candidacy.AD

AD

The moment brings significant opportunities for Biden to showcase that he is Trump’s primary foil, and his allies hope it will cause the party to rally behind him even amid a fractious Democratic primary process.But it also creates the potential for political turmoil, with a daily onslaught of accusations — many of them unfounded and dismissed by fact-checkers — as Trump and his allies seek to focus as much on Biden as Democrats do on the president.Many Democrats already are worried about reliving the way Hillary Clinton was attacked in 2016, and fear that Biden’s campaign could stumble in much the same way hers did while facing Trump’s aggressive tactics.Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens would be at the center of any impeachment proceedings.And while there has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the Bidens’ part, a months-long investigation by Congress would bring about frequent reminders that Biden’s son was earning money from a Ukrainian gas company while his father, as vice president, was overseeing diplomatic efforts in the country.AD

AD

The impeachment proceedings are also ones in which several of Biden’s primary rivals — the list includes six senators and two representatives — could take part.Biden previously called on Trump to release a transcript of his conversation with the Ukrainian president, which Trump said he would do Wednesday.On Tuesday, Biden also called on Trump to release a copy of the formal complaint made by the whistleblower, which congressional overseers have been blocked from receiving.Biden is mostly alone in the 2020 Democratic presidential field in not calling for the House to begin an immediate impeachment inquiry.Referring to Trump’s targeting of Biden, she added, “If that’s not an impeachable offense, I don’t know what is.”

AD

Biden spoke only obliquely Tuesday about the fact that he was Trump’s target, and he never mentioned his son specifically.“I knew, when I decided to run, this president would attack me and anyone else who he thought would be a threat to his winning again,” Biden said.And know that, even though every reputable publication that has looked at the charge that has been made against me, and they found them baseless and untrue and without merit, that’s not about to stop him.”

AD

Although Biden’s rhetoric escalated, his position was largely the same as it has been for months.During a June 4 event in New Hampshire, Biden was asked by an 11-year-old girl if he supported impeaching Trump.“If the president does not soon start to cooperate with the legitimate investigations of the Congress, then in fact the Congress has no option but to begin an impeachment inquiry,” Biden said.Recent national polling has shown Trump trailing former vice president Joe Biden and several other Democrats, while polling in several battleground states has not presented a much brighter picture for the president.AD

The list of Democrats calling for Trump’s impeachment has been bolstered in recent days by revelations that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son in a phone call that took place shortly after Trump had temporarily suspended military aid to the country.Democrats have accused Trump of trying to pressure a foreign power to hurt Biden, now a leading Democratic presidential contender.AD

In surveys of registered voters since the start of August, Trump has trailed Biden by 14 percentage points in a Fox News poll, by 15 points in a Washington Post-ABC poll, by 12 points in an Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP poll and by 16 points in a Quinnipiac University poll.Trump trailed Biden by 10 points, a statistically significant edge.Biden led Trump by 9 points; Sanders had a slight 4-point edge, while Warren and Harris were tied with Trump.The official emphatically denied that there was any link between blocking the aid and pressing Zelensky into investigating the Bidens, stating: “It had nothing to do with a quid pro quo.”

But on Capitol Hill, Democrats were calling for an investigation of what they viewed as potential “extortion,” as Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking Democrat, put it Monday.Zelensky’s “entire” administration was concerned “that the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens,” Murphy said, citing his interactions with numerous Ukrainian officials during an early September trip there.AD

AD

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases — at one point, threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees.Atkinson informed the House and Senate intelligence committees of the complaint’s existence Sept. 9 — the same day three House committees launched an investigation to determine whether Trump and his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had improperly pushed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.Correction: This story was updated to clarify that, during his visit to Ukraine earlier this month, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) learned of concerns from several officials in President Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration that U.S. aid was being withheld because of the Ukrainian government’s unwillingness to investigate the Bidens.Zelensky, however, did not specifically draw a connection to the Bidens when he met with Murphy.We then learned that Trump was said to have pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the family of former vice president Joe Biden, whose son served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.The Wall Street Journal reported Trump brought up Biden and his son eight times in the call with Zelensky.AD

AD

After we learned all that, Trump didn’t deny he brought up Biden in the call, though he maintains he did nothing wrong.On Monday, he said he did not make military aid conditional on Ukraine investigating Biden and his family.And now we learned through The Washington Post on Monday night that Trump stopped military aid to Ukraine (aid even Republicans in Congress wanted to go to the country) a week before he made the call and apparently talked about Biden.He told The Post’s congressional team Monday: “He simply raised the issue of Biden, and I don’t believe he should have done it.), a former Trump critic who recently got Trump's endorsement in a primary, simply said: “I'm not doing any interviews right now.”

Others are trying to focus on what Biden may or may have not done, but the facts to allege wrongdoing just don’t seem to be there.After the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had mentioned Biden multiple times in the call, Trump admitted that Biden was a subject of the call.One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption, so it’s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.” That does not explain why Giuliani was there pressing Ukraine to investigate Biden, nor does it account for the report from the Wall Street Journal that in a single call Trump eight times pressed the Ukrainians to work with Giuliani on finding dirt on Biden.AD

AD

On Sunday, Trump was more specific about Biden: “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

The answer to the question as to whether Trump tried to enlist Ukraine to help his reelection campaign is partially answered by Giuliani’s presence in the story line.(“Since spring, Giuliani has pushed the Ukrainians to investigate a gas tycoon who had Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma Holdings starting in 2014.According to the New York Times, Hunter Biden was paid as much as $50,000 some months for his work,” The Post reported.)To investigate this conduct, the House needs some or all of the following: The transcript of the call (which one can think of as the White House tapes in the Watergate scandal), the whistleblower complaint that legally must be forwarded to Congress, and any other witnesses to the conduct pertaining to aid for dirt on Biden.None of this requires investigation of a quid pro quo, although evidence should quickly establish whether aid was withheld explicitly to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden.They're scared to death that we have the momentum to move to Medicare-for-all.”

The insurance industry ads make good foils, but Sanders is just as happy to criticize Biden.“If Joe Biden or anybody else wants to use the Republican Party and the health-care industry talking points, I guess they can.“You know, I think when I raised the issue during the last debate, that we spend twice as much, Biden's response was, 'This is America.'“Democrats are stuck in a doom loop of premature polling,” by Matthew Yglesias

May 1: The New York Times publishes a story tying Joe Biden’s pressure campaign in Ukraine to Shokin having investigated Burisma, portraying it as a potential liability in his 2020 campaign.Around the same time, former Ukrainian prosecutor Kostiantyn H. Kulyk tells the Times that Yovanovitch had thwarted his efforts to deliver damaging information about the Bidens to the FBI, by denying his visa request.May 7: Bloomberg casts doubt on the Times’s report, citing Ukrainian officials who say the Burisma investigation had long been dormant when Joe Biden applied pressure on Ukraine’s government.Explain to me why Biden shouldn’t be investigated if his son got millions from a Russian loving crooked Ukrainian oligarch while He was VP and point man for Ukraine.In the same time frame, officials tell the whistleblower that Ukrainian leaders believe “that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to ‘play ball’ on the issues that had been publicly aired by Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani.”

May 16: Lutsenko says there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.May 19: In an interview with Fox News, Trump explicitly references Biden’s efforts in Ukraine.“Biden, he calls them and says ‘Don’t you dare persecute, if you don’t fire this prosecutor’ — The prosecutor was after his son,” Trump says.Can you imagine if I did that?”

Again, the Burisma probe was dormant at the time, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials, and there was no evidence it focused on any actions by the Bidens.June 21: Giuliani tweets that Zelensky is “still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden bribery of Pres Poroshenko.”

July 22: Shokin alleges to The Post that he was removed over the Biden issue.“I will answer that the activities of Burisma, the involvement of his son, Hunter Biden, and the [prosecutor general’s office] investigators on his tail, are the only — I emphasize, the only — motives for organizing my resignation,” he says.One investigation involves CrowdStrike, an Internet security company that probed the Democratic National Committee hack in 2016, and the other involves the Bidens.He later adds: “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ...(According to the New York Times, the meeting involves Giuliani’s encouraging Zelensky’s government to investigate Hunter Biden.)Sept. 2: Pence says he didn’t discuss Biden with Zelensky, but that he did suggest that aid was conditioned on rooting out corruption.Sept. 5: The Post editorial board writes that it had been “reliably told” that Trump was “attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.”

Sept. 8: Taylor texts to Volker and Sondland, saying, “The nightmare is they give the interview and don’t get the security assistance.But he also suggests it would be okay if Trump withheld aid in exchange for Ukraine investigating the Bidens.“It is perfectly appropriate for [Trump] to ask a foreign government to investigate this massive crime that was made by a former vice president.”

Also Tuesday, Biden made a public statement.We have a president who believes he is above the law,” Biden said.We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of “inherent contempt” and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”

They are referring to allegations Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to reopen an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of corruption by Joe Biden and his son.But Trump seems impervious to the growing political firestorm — indeed, he appeared to be stoking it yesterday with incendiary comments targeting Biden at the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York.The latest: “President Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials,” per our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig.But Zelensky spoke with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) during an early September visit to Ukraine and “'directly' expressed concerns at their meeting that 'the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence' of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens,” per our colleagues.Trump took his attacks on Biden and the press to a whole new level:

“If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair right now,” Trump told reporters on Monday from a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly.https://t.co/pWD7xmVLQO — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 23, 2019

You are reading the Power Up newsletter.It’s not a “win” for Biden’s competitors if they allow Trump to pretend this is about Biden; it is in their collective interest to make certain the focus is solely where it belongs, on Trump.AD

It shouldn’t go unnoticed that Biden is holding his own in the polls and looked tough, aggressive and properly indignant about Trump’s effort to escape blame.Biden might wind up earning some sympathy, but more important gaining some fire and focus in going toe-to-toe with Trump on this issue.The Post and other outlets have reported that Trump tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden — and that Trump’s decision to delay aid to Ukraine may have been related to that push.AD

In response, Trump’s defenders went into overdrive suggesting that Biden, his son Hunter, the media or the whistleblower who filed a complaint apparently related to Trump’s Ukraine efforts were more guilty than Trump himself.AD

For example: Trump’s withholding the money from Ukraine wasn’t about pressuring Zelensky to probe Biden but, instead, about “corruption.”

“It’s very important to talk about corruption,” Trump said on Monday.He added: “Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

A search of Factba.se, a website that compiles all of Trump’s tweets and remarks, suggests that Trump had never talked about corruption in Ukraine before this week — with the exception of highlighting a New York Times reporter’s tweet about Biden back in May.Joe Biden was pressuring the Ukrainian government to root out corruption in their own country and bring about democratic reforms.”

Democrats who oppose single-payer begin to speak up.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who spoke directly with the Ukrainians, can provide a sworn statement substantiating the Ukrainians’ concern that Trump was pressuring them to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son.(That is precisely what Biden, according to The Post’s report, intends to ask Congress to do.)Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist for AGF Investments, dismissed the possibility of market fallout from the firestorm in Washington over reports Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — and the renewed impeachment talk it has touched off.The latest Des Moines Register poll showed the senator leading in Iowa for the first time, edging ahead of Biden, 22 percent to 20 percent, though still within the survey’s 4 percent margin of error.Biden is backed by 31 percent, Warren pulled in 25 percent, and Sanders, at 14 percent, was the only other candidates with more than single-digit support.His scorched earth assault on Biden comes as the former vice president is slipping into second place in the fight to win the nomination.Right now, polls suggest that Democrats are favored in 2020, including with Joe Biden leading by as much as double digits nationally and in key states.YouGov asked Tuesday, “If President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, would you support or oppose impeachment?” In that case, 55 percent supported impeachment -- including 44 percent “strongly" -- while just 36 percent opposed it.AD

AD

Trump just announced that he will be releasing a full transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president, which will supposedly show that he didn’t pressure him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden at all.If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”

Stevens’s announcement follows a new Washington Post report that Trump ordered his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which the president is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden’s son.… Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) mainly kept his focus on Biden, but he also suggested that Trump should release more details about his call with Zelensky.… Later, in an exchange with reporters, Grassley declined to say whether he believes it is appropriate that Trump brought up Biden in his phone call with Zelensky.Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, said he believes Trump was wrong to have raised Biden in his call with Zelensky.But he dismissed calls for the president’s impeachment and said that so far no evidence has emerged of a quid pro quo offer by Trump of military aid in exchange for investigating Biden.‘He simply raised the issue of Biden, and I don’t believe he should have done it,’ Rubio said.“Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?”

Trump is basically begging for impeachment, so just give it to him already.“Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?” Conservative Jonah Goldberg writes in the Los Angeles Times: “The most noxious part of Ukraine-Biden whistleblower affair is Team Trump thinks we’re all idiots.”

-- In Trump’s attacks on Biden, Democrats see a worrisome reprise of 2016.Matt Viser and Isaac Stanley-Becker report: “Biden’s campaign released videos last weekend to supporters and memos to reporters attempting to debunk the unsubstantiated claims Trump is promoting about Biden, his son Hunter and Ukraine’s freshly minted celebrity president.… But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, the campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis.The skirmish illustrated how ill-equipped Democrats, busy battling one another in the fight for the nomination, are to compete with Trump’s online megaphone, which includes not just his own Twitter feed and that of the Republican National Committee’s leadership, but also a regiment of conservative talking heads and highly active Internet trolls who have closed ranks around the president.”

-- To wit: Trump kept his focus on Biden at the U.N. on Monday.Sitting next to the Polish president, he claimed to reporters that, if Biden was a Republican, the media would have him in “the electric chair by right now.” Anne Gearan, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker report: “‘The one who’s got the problem is Biden,’ Trump said.“I’m not doing any interviews right now” - he notes that he’s on senate intel committee “so we have our own briefings on these topics...and we haven’t gotten them all yet.” — Elizabeth Landers (@ElizLanders) September 23, 2019

Biden encouraged the release of the Ukraine call transcript:

So release the transcript of the call then.https://t.co/pWD7xmVLQO — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 23, 2019

But a former Obama speechwriter was skeptical about Trump’s motives if he releases the Ukraine call transcript:

This is a trap.That’s what’s so outrageous about Trump’s alleged push to get dirt on his potential 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, in a July 25 phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Trump claimed he wanted to pressure “Europe and other nations to contribute to Ukraine.” Trump had suggested Sunday that in the July call he had urged Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son’s work for a Ukrainian gas company.Forget the political jousting between Trump and Biden, and consider the Ukrainian soldier in the field fighting to save his country.It would go something like this:

AD

AD

“Trump and his private attorney called on a foreign government to dig up dirt on a political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden.But over seven days, the revelations that the president sought the help of Zelensky to investigate Biden infuriated Democrats, particularly lawmakers with national security credentials.“And in light of the damning allegations the president has admitted to, the time is now.”

Biden on Tuesday called for Congress to begin impeachment of Trump if the White House continues to stonewall congressional investigations, including questions regarding reports that Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.Democrats say there’s been a significant shift in the tenor of the discussion following reports that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his family.“It’s just another day at the office.”

But Trump was dogged by difficult questions pertaining to a phone call with the Ukrainian president in which he allegedly brought up investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Democratic Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said the transcript “reads like a classic mob shakedown.” White House officials said that the document does not show the president seeking an investigation of Biden’s son in exchange for providing aid to Ukraine, and that accusations the president offered a quid pro quo to undermine a political rival are untrue.AD

Trump had denied the suggestion that he linked the disbursement of U.S. military aid to Ukraine’s willingness to investigate Biden’s son, saying Tuesday that he withheld the aid over a concern that European countries were not contributing enough to help support Ukraine.Even before the transcript was released, Trump admitted that he asked Zelensky to probe Biden’s son, who has connections to a business that was under investigation, but he denied exerting any pressure on him.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.He argued that he only contacted Ukrainian officials at the request of the State Department, called for investigations of “corrupt” Democrats, and repeatedly alleged that former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter had done wrong in Ukraine.The allegation about the Bidens, which Trump has also voiced, has not been backed up by any official evidence thus far, The Post’s Fact Checker reported.Biden Family sale of office to Ukraine was not the only one or the most egregious.The saga began unfolding last week when The Post reported that a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Biden.AD

For most of the roughly 13-minute interview, Giuliani sought to shift the focus from himself back to Democrats and Biden.Giuliani argued that Democrats have been “covering up for what will turn out to be massive corruption in the Obama administration,” highlighting allegations that then-Vice President Biden had pressed the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor who had been investigating a natural gas firm that employed Hunter Biden.According to The Post’s Fact Checker, that investigation was shelved before Biden’s attempts to oust the prosecutor.Additionally, Hunter Biden, who sat on the company’s board for five years, was never accused of wrongdoing during the investigation.I don’t know, only Donald Trump is not entitled to a defense in America.”

As he pointed fingers at Democrats and a “crooked press corps,” Giuliani also spouted claims, without evidence, that the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and an FBI agent assigned to investigate the Hunter Biden corruption allegations were both part of a conspiracy organized by liberal billionaire George Soros — talking so much that his voice became hoarse.Hahn had just accused Giuliani of “making things up” about the Bidens, and the lawyer was raring to go.AD

AD

As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump’s potential rival in the 2020 race, former vice president Joe Biden, and Biden’s son Hunter.AD

AD

But Trump admitted this week that he had done some of what his own advisers feared, using the call to raise the issue of Biden with Zelensky.The former New York mayor appears to have seen Zelensky, a political neophyte elected president of Ukraine in April and sworn in in May, as a potential ally on two political fronts: punishing those Giuliani suspected of playing a role in exposing the Ukraine-related corruption of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and delivering political ammunition against Biden.Within days of her ouster on May 9, Giuliani seemed determined to seize an unsanctioned diplomatic role for himself, announcing plans to travel to Ukraine to push for investigations that would “be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.”

AD

Giuliani canceled the trip amid an ensuing backlash over his purpose but later met with one of Zelensky’s senior aides in Madrid and pressed the issue of Ukraine’s helping against Biden.In a May 19 interview on Fox News, Trump recited repeatedly disproved allegations that then-Vice President Biden had coerced Ukraine to drop an investigation into the owner of an energy company, Burisma, for which Biden’s son Hunter was a board member.Though Hunter Biden had served on the Burisma board for five years — a questionable decision given his father’s influential position — he was never accused of any wrongdoing by Ukrainian authorities.The probe had been shelved before any action by the vice president, and the elder Biden’s efforts involved removing a prosecutor widely criticized by the West as failing to tackle corruption.Nevertheless, Trump is alleged to have used his July 25 call with Zelensky to get Ukraine to revive this dormant inquiry and widen it to include possible wrongdoing by Biden.Although the question of a linkage or leverage never came up in the formal NSC discussions, participants began to believe that Trump was “withholding the aid until [Ukraine] gave him something on Biden or Manafort.”

It was in this stretch, in July, that some officials began to question the wisdom of a Trump call with Zelensky.But, mindful of Giuliani’s agitation and influence, some worried that even if Trump were coached before the call, the president would not be able to resist pressing Zelensky for dirt on Biden.AD

The contents of Trump’s call were released by the White House on Wednesday, showing that Trump repeatedly pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations that might yield political dirt against Trump’s adversaries, including former vice president Joe Biden.Republicans defended the president and lobbed counteraccusations at Biden.Giuliani had separately pressed Ukrainian officials for a Biden inquiry.As the half-hour conversation went on, Trump’s requests of Zelensky shifted to a different topic: investigating the Bidens.“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said, according to the memo.“Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it.When you have a wonderful meeting or a wonderful phone conversation.”

Trump denied any wrongdoing and suggested the Biden family deserved to be investigated for possible corruption, making unsubstantiated allegations they’ve taken millions of dollars out of China.Kupec also said Trump had never spoken with Barr “about having Ukraine investigate anything related to former vice president Biden or his son,” nor had Barr talked about “anything related to Ukraine” with Giuliani.The president’s decision followed reports that he pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden, considered a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in 2020, and his son, Hunter Biden.Trump has acknowledged publicly that he asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that came under scrutiny by authorities there.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.The complaint involves Trump’s phone call with Zelensky, in which Trump has admitted asking Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, one of Trump’s potential 2020 rivals, and Biden’s son Hunter Biden.AD

AD

So far, the Trump administration has stonewalled Congress’s requests for the full complaint, and Trump has denied there was any quid pro quo between his request to investigate Biden and the military aid.The issue emerged again, on July 25, when Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate CrowdStrike during a call in which he also belittled special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and urged investigation of the son of former vice president Joseph Biden.What was said on the call is not precisely known — though Trump has said he will release the transcript — but Trump has acknowledged he raised former vice president Joe Biden, currently leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination.AD

AD

Trump originally said he halted the aid because of worries about corruption — suggesting also that “corruption” by Biden was a concern — but at the United Nations, he changed his story.“I’m leading in the polls; they have no idea how they stop me.”

Just about every poll has Trump trailing many of his Democratic rivals, in particular Biden.Biden led Trump by 15 percentage points in a Fox News poll, 8 points in a SurveyUSA poll, and 15 points in a Post-ABC News poll.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who spoke with Zelensky during an early September visit to Ukraine, said the Ukrainian president “directly” expressed concerns at their meeting that “the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence” of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens, The Post reported.But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden.What Joe Biden did for his son, that’s something they should be looking at.”

AD

Here, Trump continues his misleading effort to suggest that Biden somehow was involved in corruption.In fact, Biden’s case has gotten stronger with time.Trump repeatedly has falsely claimed that Biden in 2015 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating Ukraine’s largest private gas company, Burisma, which had added Biden’s son, Hunter, to its board.AD

But it turns out that the investigation had already been shelved when Biden acted and may have even involved a side company, not Burisma.Hunter Biden, who served on the board for five years, was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and “Joe Biden’s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,” said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms.“And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.”

Shokin was ousted three months after Biden’s visit.“The United States and other Western nations had for months called for the ousting of Mr. Shokin, who was widely criticized for turning a blind eye to corrupt practices and for defending the interests of a venal and entrenched elite.”

Moreover, Yuri Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.By continuing to claim that Biden “did” something for his son, Trump persists in spreading a false narrative about a diplomatic maneuver hailed at the time as a step toward reducing corruption in Ukraine.The Pinocchio Test

In the space of minutes, the president told falsehoods about aid to Ukraine, his standing in the polls, the history of impeachment, impressions of his phone call and of course the role that Biden played in trying to root out corruption in Ukraine.Crucially, the call details show Trump explicitly pressing Zelensky to talk to Giuliani and Barr about Trump’s desire to see Ukraine investigate Biden, his most likely general-election opponent.AD

“If you could speak to [Giuliani], that would be great,” Trump tells Zelensky, before saying that “a lot of people” want to find out about the situation involving Joe Biden and the Ukraine, and asking Zelensky to “look into it.”

AD

That’s a reference to the convoluted fabrication that Trump, Giuliani and right-wing media have pushed involving Biden, his most likely general-election opponent, and his son.AD

Giuliani viewed Zelensky as a potential ally who could be enlisted, among other things, to provide dirt on Biden.That effort hit its climax when Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden, as the call details show.He told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump didn’t bring up Biden, that the Ukrainian president did.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, after saying he had not read the transcript, said this when I asked if it’s OK that Trump talked Bidens with Ukraine: “Who brought it up?— Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 25, 2019

Here is the first time Biden is brought up in the call.It’s by Trump:

TRUMP: ”The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

AD

AD

McCarthy’s factually incorrect answer syncs up with talking points that the White House sent around to Republican lawmakers (and accidentally, Democrats).The White House is trying to point out that Trump didn’t mention Biden until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky brought up that he talked with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.The Post reports that officials sidelined in all this by Giuliani worried that with Trump’s personal lawyer in charge, the president “would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump’s potential rival in the 2020 race, former vice president Joe Biden, and Biden’s son Hunter.”

That’s exactly what happened.Grassley’s statement gets at another defense that some Republicans are offering: Trump didn’t do anything wrong by bringing up Biden because he was asking Ukraine to root out corruption.How is Biden related to corruption in Ukraine at all?When Biden was vice president in 2016, he pressured Ukraine’s then-president to fire its top prosecutor over allegations that prosecutor wasn’t doing enough to root out corruption.At the time Biden’s son Hunter was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.Trump alleged the prosecutor that Joe Biden wanted gone was investigating the energy company, but at the time that particular investigation had been shelved, reports The Post’s Fact Checker.Biden was pushing for a change that other Western counties also wanted.In other words, there’s no evidence Biden was doing anything egregious with his power.And he asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden.AD

AD

PORTMAN: “Would it have been better had he not brought up Biden’s name?First, note that in his phone call with Zelensky, Trump repeatedly said that he wanted Barr involved in the effort to dig up dirt to use against Joe Biden.They then moved on to the subject of Biden, and Trump said that “I will ask [Rudolph W. Giuliani] to call you along with the Attorney General.”

AD

AD

Trump went on: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.”

And then again: “I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to [have] Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.” And then one more time: “I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.”

As Rep. Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a news conference Wednesday, Trump invoking Barr “adds another layer of depravity to this conversation,” because it made clear that the U.S. government and Trump’s personal attorney would be working together to force Ukraine to aid Trump’s reelection bid.We know that Giuliani pressured Ukraine to open an investigation that might produce some dirt on Biden and his son.His father, former vice president Joe Biden, had traveled to China at the time to meet with that country’s leaders while he was in office.Schweizer wrote in a summary of the 2018 book that 10 days after the Bidens arrived in China, “Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government’s Bank of China.”

AD

Trump on Wednesday put it this way: “When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two.I think it’s a horrible thing.”

AD

Trump made his comments on the day that the White House released a transcript of his conversation in which he urged the president of Ukraine to look into Hunter Biden’s work as a board member of a gas company in that country, a job that was given when Joe Biden was vice president and dealing with Ukraine policy.House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, while Trump has tried to keep the focus on what he calls corrupt acts by the Bidens.Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013.Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities.AD

Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount.However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client’s role has been misconstrued.He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.AD

Moreover, Mesires said, it was not until October 2017 that Hunter Biden acquired a financial stake in BHR.Hunter Biden bought a 10 percent equity interest that was worth $430,000 in July, Mesires said.“To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,” Meseris said in a statement Wednesday.“The characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese, or suggesting that Mr. Biden has earned millions of dollars from the firm is a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden’s role with BHR.”

.AD

AD

But the news of Trump’s private request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden — first revealed in news reports, then confirmed in a declassified summary of the call released by the White House — threatened to completely overshadow a global summit of more than 150 leaders.Over three days in New York, Trump seemed to confirm all of the traits McGrath and 121 others had flagged in calling Trump “fundamentally dishonest” and “a distinct threat to civil liberty in the United States” with a foreign policy “unmoored in principle.”

AD

AD

Trump repeatedly trashed Biden, suggesting it was the former vice president who had inappropriately pressured Ukrainian officials to help his son’s business dealings — despite evidence to the contrary.AD

He has aligned with brutal North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who has sent Trump a series of flattering personal letters, over the U.S. intelligence community and military — and said he agreed with North Korean state media’s characterization of Biden in May as a “fool of low IQ.” Two weeks ago, Trump sided with Kim again over their mutual distaste for former White House national security adviser John Bolton.The president’s fixation on Biden is now at the heart of a historic impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats, who accuse Trump of using the power and leverage of the U.S. government to pressure Ukraine into investigating his potential rival.AD

In a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump seemed to push for Ukraine’s government to develop evidence against Biden and son Hunter, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House on Wednesday.Trump said during the call that he would get U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr to work with the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens, which set off a whistleblower complaint and events that could culminate in an impeachment trial.AD

The reinvigorated impeachment push this week is already leading the president to further focus on Joe Biden, as Trump and his supporters seek to shift attention from potential White House misconduct to whether the former vice president abused his position to help Hunter when he served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company during the Obama administration, charges that have little grounding in fact.On Wednesday, Trump said he was willing to release the whistleblower complaint against him so long as information was also released about Biden’s dealings with Ukraine and China.AD

“[I] also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China,” Trump said during a news conference at the United Nations in New York, without offering any evidence to back up this charge.I think they should have transparency for that.”

AD

Trump’s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states.Campaign aides previously had been wary of singling out any of the Democratic presidential candidates, opting instead to lump the group of more than 20 contenders together under the banner of “socialism.”

AD

That began to change early this summer, as Trump’s focus on Biden hardened and the president began taking aim at the former vice president more often and more energetically than any other candidate.Trump’s attacks intensified as internal and public polling showed Biden as the president’s most competitive challenger, with large leads in states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.AD

Although several top Democratic candidates have avoided Trump in an attempt to focus on their own visions for the country, Biden has framed his campaign as a wholesale rebuttal to Trump from the very start.Biden has also targeted areas of the country Trump won in 2016 and has made proving to Democrats that he could win back states in the Upper Midwest a centerpiece of his campaign.AD

“For someone who claims to be a ‘dealmaker,’ Donald Trump has certainly given Joe Biden a lot of rent-free real estate in his own head,” said Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, listing ways Trump has fixated on Biden, including stirring “an unprecedented crisis by pressuring a foreign country to foment a universally debunked conspiracy theory.”

When Biden formally joined the race in April — launched with a criticism of Trump’s response to racist violence in Charlottesville in 2017 — Trump greeted him with a tweet.But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!”

AD

In the months since, Trump has widened his attacks on Biden, criticizing him over China, trade, Iran, North Korea, his work with segregationists, his support for the 1994 crime bill and his mental acuity.The attacks intensified after internal polling data that leaked from Trump’s campaign showed Biden ahead of Trump by significant margins in states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida.AD

Trump dismissed the polls as “fake,” but his focus on Biden has persisted.White House officials have also increasingly found ways to criticize Biden, sometimes bringing up the former vice president unprompted to contrast his record with Trump’s.AD

Last week, Trump’s campaign released a video that edited together clips of Biden’s verbal gaffes and television pundits — and Democratic campaign rival Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) — questioning the former vice president’s age and mental abilities.Although some Republican strategists have warned that focusing so much on Biden this early in the campaign would only elevate him in a crowded field, Trump has followed his instincts to meddle in the Democratic primary and sought to tear down the leading candidates.AD

Some Trump aides said the president targets Biden because the former vice president is a visible force and an easy target.AD

“Biden is the front-runner, and with his 40-plus years in politics, there’s a lot of material,” said Kelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC.Biden’s penchant for gaffes and his previous failed attempts at running for president also make him a ripe target for Trump, said Bryan Lanza, an adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign and transition efforts.“Biden’s an easy punching bag in presidential politics because he’s a three-time loser,” he said.He was in office when the deterioration of the middle class began.”

The attempt to cast Biden as the ultimate insider within a corrupt system has continued as Trump has pushed for investigations into Biden’s dealings with Ukraine.In a statement Wednesday, Parscale made the link explicit, accusing “the Bidens, the Clintons, and other career politicians” of abusing their power.Just weeks after Biden officially entered the race, Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani was attempting to contact top officials in the Ukrainian government to discuss investigating Biden.Giuliani had started to make the case publicly and to Trump that Biden had been involved in a corrupt scheme to help his son by forcing out Ukraine’s top prosecutor in 2016.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.AD

In the past, Biden’s campaign has relished the fights with Trump, contending that it elevates him in the Democratic field to showcase what a general election would look like.I wonder why the hell he’s doing that,” Biden, practically giddy, said during his first trip to Iowa.I’m going to be the object of his attention for a while, folks.”

For much of his career, Biden has been seen as a politician with strong bipartisan relationships, the one who was asked to eulogize his Republican colleagues at their funerals, the one who attempted to see the good in his political opponents.But now the full apparatus of the Republican Party is crashing down on him, attempting to reshape his reputation in the eyes of a country that Biden’s campaign says already knows him and likes him.Although Trump and his allies have cast him over the past few months as a bumbling and stumbling old man — calling him “a dummy” or “the weakest mentally” — they are now trying to paint Biden as a corrupt figure who can’t control his own son.Biden has been less personal in his characterizations of Trump but has pointed to him as a historically bad figure who is an “existential threat” to everything America stands for.❌ No quid pro quo

In the instanalysis on Fox News, host Bret Baier said, “I don’t see eight times Joe Biden being mentioned.said, “I didn’t see Joe Biden’s name mentioned in there eight times."The not-a-transcript confirms as much: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said to Zelensky.“Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it.CNBC’s Eamon Javers reports that Zelensky himself has already offered “support for President Trump by suggesting that nobody on the American side pressured him to open an investigation” into the Bidens.There are zero facts suggesting former vice president Joe Biden did anything wrong.“Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son.But Biden calling for [Ukrainian Vcitor] Shokin’s firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin’s performance.” U.S. policy was to remove Shokin, who hindered anti-corruption efforts.In turn, Democratic presidential candidates — including former vice president Joe Biden, former congressman Beto O’Rourke (Tex.“Folks, Trump is afraid of facing Joe next fall, and he keeps lashing out,” read a Biden campaign text to supporters Tuesday.“Use this link to chip in now to defend Joe Biden,” it continued, carrying a link to his campaign donation page.It was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

AD

But that’s not true.After Zelensky notes that a staff member had spoken with Giuliani, Trump raises the false allegation that Biden pushed to have a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to aid his son Hunter Biden.While Zelensky promises to move forward on investigations and make “sure to restore the honesty” to Ukraine’s government, Trump mentions only specific issues: the DNC hacking, the Bidens.Asked later that day whether he had mentioned Biden on the call, Trump demurred.If there’s corruption and we’re paying lots of money to a country, we don’t want a country that we’re giving massive aid to to be corrupting our system.”

AD

He did mention Biden, of course.Although he didn’t explicitly suggest that further aid to Ukraine was contingent on Ukraine digging into Biden’s alleged actions, his suggestion that doing so wouldn’t have been problematic does cast the transcript in another light.“That foreign country knows that if they don’t do it, there are likely to be consequences.”

AD

Murphy also said that, in his conversations with Zelensky’s team, he got the impression that aid withheld by Trump’s team “to Ukraine … was a consequence for their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens.”

On Wednesday morning, before the rough transcript was published, Giuliani appeared on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends.” He claimed that Trump would have been “derelict in his duty” had he not mentioned “corruption” to Zelensky.Giuliani was asked whether Trump mentioned Biden, a subject that Giuliani has been focused on for months and that came up when he met with an aide to Zelensky in Spain in May.“Could be possible the president of the Ukraine brought it up.”

AD

Here’s how “it” — the Biden allegations — came up.Then he continued on, talking about the Shokin firing, praising Giuliani — and asking Zelensky to look into Biden.Sometimes you just have to muck around.”

As the information wars heat up over the possible impeachment of President Trump for soliciting foreign help to investigate the Biden family, more acute than ever is the question of who, if anyone, controls information about the second son of the former vice president.XOR’easter, who says he has no connection to the Biden campaign, says his sole motive is protecting the truth.Hunter Biden served nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, which was investigated by Ukrainian prosecutors.AD

Joe Biden later pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who, in the judgment of the United States and other Western countries, was not sufficiently pursuing corruption in Ukraine.The task of elucidating these details on Hunter Biden’s Wikipedia page — a political and epistemic minefield — has been shouldered by the physicist-editor.He set to work revising the information about Hunter Biden on Friday night after seeing an image of the page on Twitter.Then he contacted an administrator and urged him to keep an eye on the Hunter Biden page in case it became a magnet for trolling.Eliminating details about Biden’s relationships, one user wrote, “Cut it out with this tabloid stuff.” The information was later restored by another anonymous user, who deemed the detail a “non-salacious reference to his relationship with his sister-in-law.” (Hunter Biden at one point was romantically involved with his late brother Beau’s widow.)AD

In the rough transcript of the July 25 call, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr to investigate the conduct of Biden and offered to meet with the foreign leader at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry.AD

Sen. Patrick J.

Three Senate GOP aides said Wednesday that their bosses were unhappy with the White House’s decision and the sense that Republican lawmakers were being forced into the difficult position of defending Trump while contending with what many Democrats see as a problematic transcript.During a closed-door Senate Republican lunch Tuesday, both Burr and Johnson underscored their own position in conversation with colleagues, who asked them whether their respective committees would launch investigations of Biden.AD

Burr said Wednesday said he had no interest in investigating the Biden-Ukraine angle.Johnson said his committee has been conducting “information gathering and oversight” related to the 2016 campaign probe, which might now involve Hunter Biden.Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said, “Biden is the one who threatened Ukraine’s aid, not Trump, and that has to be investigated.”

The tensions between Senate Republicans who view the whistleblower complaint strictly as an intelligence matter and those who see it as part of a political “witch hunt” of Trump by Democrats are almost certain to continue, lawmakers and aides said, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) having to navigate those dynamics and hold his members together amid the tumult.Giuliani had separately pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate the conduct of former vice president Joe Biden.AD

Among the talking points distributed by the White House is the claim that there was no quid pro quo and that “what the President actually talked about was entirely proper.”

The White House argues that Trump “did not mention Rudy Giuliani or Vice President Biden until after President Zelenskyy had raised Giuliani first.” But the email glosses over the fact that Trump did mention Biden of his own accord.For as much as Trump complained that the rest of his agenda is ignored in favor of what he labeled “a hoax,” he animated it with further unsubstantiated claims Wednesday that Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, had improperly profited from his father’s government role with business dealings in Ukraine and China.AD

Democrats said the transcript reveals a brazen effort by Trump to jump-start corruption investigations he hoped could hurt Biden, and to link Zelensky’s compliance with U.S. military aid Trump had put on hold.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.AD

As Trump this week first acknowledged that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden, then admitted he withheld the aid, while giving various explanations for that decision, a barrage of moderates moved toward impeachment.Biden says he’ll call for impeachment if Trump doesn’t cooperate with investigations

Analysis: The full Trump-Ukraine timeline — as of now["] Then comes the money shot: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

Zelensky promises that the next “prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate” and says “he or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.” Trump says he’ll have Giuliani and AG Barr call and says “I’m sure you will figure it out.” His closing remarks in that paragraph are chilling: “Your economy is going to get better and better I predict.As the call ends, Trump’s exit line is that he’ll “tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.”

The upshot is that the call begins with Ukraine’s president expressing the urgency of getting more United States military equipment “for defense purposes” and our president transitions immediately to saying he’d “like [Zelensky] to do us a favor though,” by which he makes clear that he is requesting help to Giuliani and Barr in going after Biden.First, we got the story of the intelligence community whistleblower, which led to the story of Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president, and as it became clear that Trump had pressured a foreign leader, possibly using withheld military aid as an inducement, to look for dirt on Joe Biden to help Trump’s reelection, the idea that an impeachment inquiry wasn’t warranted became impossible to sustain.(“An initial Justice Department statement on Barr’s role issued at the same moment the call notes were made public seemed only to rule out the attorney general being asked to work with Ukraine on such a probe, but a subsequent clarification broadened the denial to cover any presidential request to Barr to launch an inquiry into Biden.”) Even if this is true, the Justice Department found there was nothing wrong with Trump’s conduct.Most importantly, it is essential to determine what Vice President Pence knew of Trump’s efforts, whether he advised against this kind of conduct and whether he was involved in the pressure campaign to find dirt on Biden.He was willing to do anything to smear Joe Biden.AD

AD

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that,” Trump said to Zelensky, according to a rough White House transcript of the call.As The Post’s Aaron Blake wrote Tuesday: “Ukraine’s current prosecutor general told Bloomberg he had no evidence of anything illegal or corrupt by either Joe or Hunter Biden.”

This is the kind of Trump hit job with which we are now depressingly familiar.No matter whom you favor for the Democratic presidential nomination, it’s an outrage that Biden is being hurt by reports of Trump’s own lawlessness.The poll was conducted from Thursday through Monday, as details were emerging about Trump’s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump acknowledged he asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.AD

Trump has admitted to discussing his possible Democratic opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.AD

Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.AD

At the same time, an impeachment inquiry that focuses on Trump’s contacts with Ukraine could also complicate Biden’s presidential campaign, since Republicans are likely to use the process to continue to elevate discussion of his family’s business dealings while he held office.But the speaker relented following allegations Trump encouraged the Ukrainian president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son.The Trump factor: Unlike other controversies plaguing the Trump White House, the president himself has suggested he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden multiple times.“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters on Sunday morning.From the mayor: Giuliani responded to the story in a memorable appearance on Fox News last night where he claims that the State Department directed him to contact Ukrainian officials about Biden.Just take a look:

HOW THE 2020 CANDIDATES REACTED: Biden is not quite there yet, but he moved a lot closer toward endorsing an impeachment inquiry, our colleagues Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. report.“If he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said in a brief statement from Wilmington, Del.AD

Repeatedly in the July 25 phone call, Trump pressed Zelensky to launch an investigation into Biden and his son, and to greenlight another inquiry into the origins of the special counsel probe that once dogged Trump’s presidency, according to a rough transcript released by the administration Wednesday.She said that although Trump mentioned Barr in the call, the president had “not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything related to former Vice President Biden or his son,” nor had Barr discussed Ukraine with Giuliani.AD

AD

The criminal divisions’s analysis of Trump’s call essentially started and ended with the decision that a Ukrainian investigation into Biden could not be assigned a specific value.That of course was before anyone knew much at all about the president’s effort to force Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son.Trump’s and Giuliani’s descriptions of what Biden had done as vice president do not square with what actually happened, but as the Democrats have begun to circle, Trump has done everything he can to make this all about his possible challenger instead of himself.Now the Democratic leaders appear more tightly focused on Trump, Ukraine and Biden.This was such a clear violation of our norms, such a clear violation of our national security.”

On Monday night, Sherrill and six other freshmen with credentials in the military, defense or U.S. intelligence published an op-ed in The Washington Post calling for an impeachment inquiry after Trump acknowledged that he pressed Ukrainian leaders to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a leading Democratic rival for the 2020 election.AD

And here was Trump, in a span of a few days, denying foreign aid to an ally in the fight to contain Russia, while demanding Ukraine’s new president investigate 2020 rival Biden.Reporter: President Zelensky, have you felt any pressure from President Trump to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?Reporter: Would you like President Zelensky to do more on Joe Biden and the investigation?Now when Biden’s son walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and he knows nothing, and they’re paying him millions of dollars, that’s corruption.When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China.Reporter: Mr. President, in the phone call you said that he was looking into Joe Biden, that you would ask your prosecutor to look into the matter.AD

Newly released text messages turned over to House investigators by former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker suggest it was broadly understood that the White House was withholding a meeting that Zelensky desired as officials negotiated for Ukraine to pursue investigations that carried potential political benefits for Trump, one of which involved Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Zelensky said, according to the rough transcript, that his new prosecutor general “will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue” — the company for which Hunter Biden worked.The conversation, according to the memo, then became political, with Trump asking Zelensky to work with the U.S. attorney general to investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden.The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ...Trump does suggestively mention the U.S. being ‘very, very good to Ukraine’

Reports had suggested Trump talked with Zelensky about investigating potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden and his son but that there was no explicit quid pro quo — and that Trump didn’t mention that he had been withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine.AD

Trump soon adds: “The other thing: There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Intriguing comments about ousted U.S. ambassador and Ukrainian prosecutor

Viktor Shokin is the prosecutor general who was ousted in 2016 thanks to the efforts of then-Vice President Biden and other Western leaders.The Trump team has argued that this was corrupt because Shokin at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, that employed Biden’s son Biden.(U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said that investigation was dormant when Biden helped force out Shokin.)Over the past week, that call has become central to questions about the extent to which Trump tried to pressure Ukraine’s government to dig up alleged dirt on former vice president Joe Biden.On the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, Trump dismissed Democrats’ move to open an impeachment inquiry against him, denied that he pressured Ukraine’s leader to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and suggested that the White House should release even more records of his communications.Trump has acknowledged publicly that he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son, who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that came under scrutiny by authorities there.● The document showed Trump offering the help of the U.S. attorney general to investigate Biden and promising Zelensky a White House meeting after he said he would conduct such an inquiry.AD

4:30 p.m.: Trump says he wants ‘transparency’ from Biden

In tweets shortly before he was scheduled to address reporters in New York, Trump said he had informed House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and all House Republicans that he “fully” supports “transparency on so-called whistleblower information.” But he added that also wants “transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter, on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China.”

“Additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats that went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat,” Trump said.It was not immediately clear which Democrats Trump was referencing, or what he meant by “political threat.”

Trump has acknowledged publicly that he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son, who served on the board of a Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that came under scrutiny by authorities there.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.4:05 p.m.: Castro defends Biden as ‘an honorable man’

One of Biden’s 2020 Democratic presidential rivals, Julián Castro, offered words of support for the former vice president at an event in Oakland, Calif., on Wednesday afternoon.“Donald Trump is trying to do to Joe Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton; to turn somebody who has given a lifetime of service, and done it honorably, into the victim of false accusations.”

At a Democratic debate this month, Castro had gone on the attack against Biden, accusing him of forgetting the details of his own health-care plan.“Joe Biden is an honorable man,” Castro said.I have disagreements with Vice President Biden that I’ve made clear — on health care, on immigration, on other issues — but I don’t want to see this election decided by Donald Trump’s usual tearing down of other people with false accusations.”

3:35 p.m.: On Wall Street, the fear is Trump’s trade policies, not impeachment

The market reaction to Pelosi’s announcement of an impeachment inquiry into Trump was a giant shrug.“That’s why Republicans look forward to actually reading the material on which the Democrats, from a position of ignorance, are basing their unrestrained accusations.”

3:10 p.m.: Congress ‘must pursue the facts,’ Biden says

Biden reacted to the White House release of a readout of the call between Trump and Zelensky, referring to it as an “abridged version that the White House was willing to issue to the public” and reiterating his call for the full whistleblower complaint about Trump’s conduct on the call be made available to Congress.As the Biden statement came out, Trump was attacking Biden during a media availability at the United Nations with Zelensky, who seemed to be doing his best to stay out of the middle of this U.S. political scandal.Biden, who has called for impeachment if the White House doesn’t cooperate with the House’s investigations, said that Congress “must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable.”

“In the meantime, I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America’s families,” Biden said.The closed-door meeting took place hours after the White House released a rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump pressed Zelensky to work with Attorney General William P. Barr and Giuliani to investigate Biden.1 p.m.: Democratic chairmen says no “quid pro quo” is required for wrongdoing

A joint statement issued Wednesday afternoon by four Democratic committee chairmen sought to push back on Trump’s argument that he had done nothing wrong because his request for Zelensky to investigate the Bidens was not linked to U.S. military aid to Ukraine.Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities.”

Pelosi also accused the Justice Department of “acting in a rogue fashion” and being “complicit in the President’s lawlessness.”

12 p.m.: Trump-Zelensky call shows lengths to which foreign leaders go to flatter Trump

The rough transcript of Trump’s phone call with Zelensky provides evidence of Trump asking the Ukrainian president to investigate the conduct of Biden and his son Hunter.Earlier Wednesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said the rough transcript confirmed “several things.”

“The President, Donald Trump, clearly pressured the Ukrainian president to commence an investigation of the Biden family to dig up political dirt in order to bolster the president’s electoral prospects in 2020,” Jeffries said.The document shows that Trump urged Ukraine’s leader to contact Barr about opening an inquiry tied to Biden.and others stuck largely to talking points that were the same as those they used on Tuesday — keeping the focus on Biden and Pelosi.10 a.m.: Rough transcript shows Trump offering U.S. assistance to Zelensky for Biden investigation

Trump told Zelensky to work with the U.S. attorney general to investigate Biden’s conduct and offered to meet with the leader of Ukraine at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry, according to a newly released rough transcript of the call.During an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends” in which he defended Trump and attacked Biden, Giuliani was asked if he had seen the rough transcript.Presidential scholars and officials from previous White Houses said they could remember nothing like this conversation, unclassified and released by Trump on Wednesday to rebut charges that he in essence offered Zelensky continued U.S. support in exchange for dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.Many Democrats are urging that the inquiry focus solely on the present outcry — Trump’s apparent admission that he urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look for wrongdoing by the son of former vice president Joe Biden while withholding delivery of U.S. foreign aid — and not on other alleged abuses, such as the potential obstruction of justice detailed by Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel, episodes of congressional stonewalling and instances of bigotry.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), a member of Democratic leadership, said the president asking for Ukraine’s help to undermine his 2020 challenger is “a textbook abuse of power.” At a news conference, he said “the transcripts become exhibit A.”

According to the rough transcript, Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the conduct of Joe Biden and offered to meet with the new president at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry.They argue that Trump does not need to have explicitly linked U.S. financial assistance to a Biden investigation for the call to represent a clear-cut abuse of power.Star)

Biden’s comments come as top Democrats have agreed to speed up their impeachment investigation, while some Republican senators are expressing concerns with the contents of the call.But Biden said the ongoing saga, which is largely centered around unfounded allegations that he and his son committed wrongdoings in Ukraine, won’t distract from his campaign to win the Democratic presidential nomination and challenge Trump in 2020.“I am confident in the ability of the House and Senate to deal with this,” Biden said.“My job is to go out and flat beat him.”

AD

The roughly 16-minute interview kicked off Wednesday night with host Jimmy Kimmel jokingly asking Biden if there was “anything going on.”

AD

“Not much at all, just Rudy and Donald,” Biden responded, referencing Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.In recent days, the pair repeated allegations about Biden and his son Hunter that have not been supported by any official evidence thus far, according to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker.“There’s not one single solitary legitimate journalist in the world giving any credibility to this,” Biden said Wednesday, echoing comments he made to reporters on Tuesday in Wilmington, Del.AD

Still, Biden didn’t hesitate to join Kimmel in throwing shade at Trump and Giuliani.On the “outlandish scale,” Biden said Wednesday he would rank the previous 48 hours an “18 out of 10.”

“Hard to believe he was mayor of New York at one time and seemed to be doing an okay job,” Kimmel said of Giuliani.“It’s like his body has been taken over by another being.”

“I didn’t know the president could do that,” Biden quipped.Unlike his fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls, Biden has shied away from full-throated calls to begin the impeachment process, The Post reported.AD

“It’s such a blatant abuse of power,” Biden said.Biden, however, stressed that there is “much more at stake” than Trump “acting so bizarrely.”

“I can’t let this distract me in a way that takes me away from the issues that really are the reason why I’m running,” he said.“We have to restore the soul of this country — who we are, our values.”

For the rest of the interview, Biden focused on his campaign, reiterating how his decision to run was sparked by Charlottesville and the president’s infamous claim that there were “very fine people on both sides” at the violent rally, and what could happen to the U.S. if Trump is reelected.AD

AD

“This division in our country is just so devastating, so devastating for so many people, and it’s ruining our standing around the world,” Biden said.We can’t let that happen.”

Biden also continued to criticize Trump’s policy on health care, the environment and gun control.AD

A spokeswoman for Barr has said that he did not know about the phone call until the whistleblower issue was raised and that he had not spoken with Trump about assisting Ukraine with an investigation of Biden or his son.In the July phone call, Trump repeatedly pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that came under scrutiny by authorities there.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.”

The complaint also describes alleged actions by Giuliani that seemed designed to pressure the Ukrainian government to go after Joe Biden.The whistleblower learned from other U.S. officials that Giuliani’s visit to Madrid on Aug. 2 to meet with a Zelensky aide was “a direct follow-up” to Trump’s July 25 call to the Ukrainian president and request for an investigation of the Bidens, the complaint says.In a heated and occasionally profane interview with The Washington Post, Giuliani denied the allegations and excoriated Democrats and the media for asking questions about him rather than about Hunter Biden.— President Trump, remarks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Sept. 25, 2019

We’ve been writing a lot about Trump’s false claims concerning Ukraine, Joe Biden and Biden’s son, Hunter.AD

We had fact-checked this back in May, but as the Ukraine controversy has heated up, it’s also become a regular staple of Trump’s attacks on Biden.Hunter Biden, as detailed in a New Yorker profile published in July, has had a checkered life and yet has managed to score business deals in countries — in particular Ukraine and China — that might not have materialized without the prominence of his father.AD

Trump, of course, chose to focus on Biden’s son, not his own daughter.He has claimed that Hunter Biden “made millions of dollars from China” and “took money from China — a lot of money.” He also said that Hunter Biden walked out of China with “$1.5 billion in a fund … after one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two.”

So let’s back up a bit.Hunter Biden launched a consulting firm in 2008.At times, Hunter Biden and Archer did deals that did not include Heinz, who apparently was more wary of business arrangements that might attract public attention.AD

Archer and Hunter Biden, for instance, connected with Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund.Hunter Biden originally was on an advisory board for BHR and was not an equity owner in the fund while Joe Biden was vice president.AD

In December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew from Japan to China with Joe Biden on Air Force Two.Hunter Biden was not spotted much, though Schweizer makes a big deal about Hunter following his father into a shop as the vice president buys an ice cream bar.AD

“The vice president raised his Magnum ice cream bar to show the world’s press how personable Joe Biden could be,” Schweizer wrote.“Intentionally or not, Hunter Biden was showing the Chinese that he had guanxi [connections].”

AD

The New Yorker detailed that Schweizer’s claims about the China deal are disputed by the Biden camp.In May, the Fact Checker also reported that Hunter Biden had not received any payments from the deal.Still, the New Yorker said that Hunter Biden’s behavior at one point raised questions among the vice president’s staff about whether he was leveraging access for his benefit.Twelve days after he flew to Beijing, Hunter Biden joined the board of BHR.George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in a July interview with The Washington Post’s Michael Kranish that his client’s role has been misconstrued.He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.AD

AD

“To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,” Mesires told The Fact Checker after Trump’s remarks with Zelensky.“The characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese, or suggesting that Mr. Biden has earned millions of dollars from the firm is a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden’s role with BHR.”

Mesires said that the investment management company “was capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB [Chinese Renminbi], or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion.” Because Biden acquired a 10 percent minority interest, his “capital commitment is approximately $420,000,” Mesires said.The Pinocchio Test

The president says Hunter Biden “walked out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund” and earned “millions” of dollars from the deal.AD

AD

One could argue Hunter Biden has been trading off his father’s name, and certainly arranging a handshake between a business partner and the vice president in China raises eyebrows.But Hunter Biden did not raise money for the fund; instead, he was on a board that advised potential investors.He did not obtain an equity stake until after his father was no longer vice president — and that investment of less than half a million dollars has not yet yielded a payoff for Hunter Biden, according to his attorney.AD

On Wednesday, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched an impeachment inquiry over Trump’s attempts to persuade Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, other House Democrats pushed for more information about Trump’s hotel business.Asked about the revelation that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president for dirt on Joe Biden's son, Abraham called it “the liberal media grasping at straws,” something that would not play in Louisiana.“Biden's Democratic rivals tiptoe around Trump-Ukraine grenade,” by Christopher Cadelago

The various ways Democrats are handling this controversy.ON THE TRAIL

On Wednesday, the president defended his decision to ask Ukraine's new president for dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter.Joe Biden has responded in two ways: calling all of this ridiculous and trying to return the focus to health care.When he has talked about the Republican attempts to investigate Hunter Biden, it has been to talk about how the president's party is afraid of him.“The reason I’m being attacked is most polls show me beating him by 10 to 15 points,” Biden told donors via speakerphone Tuesday night.The attacks on me, they’re going to come and they’re going to go and they’ll soon be forgotten.”

The willingness of Republicans to attack Biden, and justify the president's approach, is raising one of the most important political questions of the primary: Have Democrats figured out what to do when Trump attacks?Some in the party wonder whether angry voters will rally behind Biden, seeing the attacks as evidence that Trump doesn't want to run against him.Some worry that Republicans could weaponize Hunter Biden the way that they once weaponized Hillary Clinton's private email server.“There are some Democrats who have 2016 PTSD,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, one of Biden's first supporters in Congress.But in this case, come on: We're talking about something completely manufactured by a president who just committed the crime of extortion.”

The fight between Trump and Biden is asymmetrical; the president is almost unanimously supported in his party, while Biden's lead in the Democratic primary was slipping even before the Ukraine story.Of the 275 congressional Democrats who are not running for president, just 21 have endorsed Biden.They are not as sure what will happen to Biden.So far, most congressional Democrats and several of Biden's primary rivals have condemned Trump and defended the former vice president.“All Democratic candidates need to stand in solidarity against President Trump’s ad hominem attacks on Vice President Biden,” Khanna said.Pressed on whether the controversy over Hunter Biden and Ukraine made Biden a weaker candidate, Sanders demurred: “You make the judgment.Neither statement had much solidarity with Biden.At a meeting this week of Story County, Iowa, Democrats, opinion of the accusations against Biden — not the substance, but the risk — dovetailed with voters' own candidate preferences.Lisa Heddens, a 55-year-old supervisor, said it was deeply sad to see Biden’s family come under attack.A spot from Joe Biden cryptically referred to politicians who want to “scrap” the Affordable Care Act, and one from Michael Bennet warned that ending private insurance “makes no sense.”

Tom Steyer, “Village.” The investor-turned-politico's latest ad emphasizes the need for Democrats to flip the Senate, name-checking two Republicans on the ballot next year (Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham) and one who isn't (Chuck Grassley).Sanders narrowly leads with Latinos, with 28 percent support to 26 percent for Biden and 14 for Warren; Biden leads with black voters, with 32 percent to Warren's 24 percent, Harris's 18 percent and Sanders's 11 percent.The “excitement” margin among those voters for Biden is just seven points; by a 12-point margin, those voters say they would not be excited about a Sanders nomination.Joe Biden.Warren appeared on 61 percent ballots to 50 percent for Sanders, 34 percent for Kamala Harris, 32 percent for Joe Biden, 21 percent for Pete Buttigieg, and 12 percent for a true dark horse: Trump.Still to be determined: whether unions with more conservative membership, such as the building trades, will follow more left-wing unions, or will find Biden's campaign more compelling.AD

The coming weeks will test whether Trump’s familiar blame-the-accuser-and-counterattack playbook — while floating dark conspiracies to divert attention — will be successful in the face of mounting evidence that he asked Ukraine to dig up dirt on potential 2020 Democratic opponent Joe Biden.A key element of Trump’s strategy has been to try to shine an uncomfortable light on Biden by making unsubstantiated claims of corruption about the former vice president and his son Hunter.Nearly every set of public remarks Trump has made this week has been heavy on Biden references and insinuations.Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said it was smart for Republicans to “focus on Biden and make the Democrats look ridiculous.”

A legislative pursuit is also in the works: Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told reporters this week that he has “some real legitimate questions” about the Bidens’ connections to Ukraine and is exploring a formal investigation.As you know, the complaint involves a July 25 call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to interfere in a U.S. election by investigating the role that Joe Biden, a likely general-election opponent, played in a fake scandal that Trumpworld invented out of nothing.At this point, the Times reports, Giuliani had already been actively trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden.The details of the call show Trump directing Zelensky to talk not just to Giuliani, but also to Barr, about investigating Biden.Apparently, because Trump did not conclude the July phone conversation by saying, “All right: you will dig up dirt on Biden and I will release the military aid to your country I’m holding up, because that is the exchange we have agreed upon,” that means it was perfectly fine.But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden.”

AD

Which is exactly the problem.The committee’s ranking Republican, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), congratulates Democrats on the “rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president.” He talks about the “Democrat’s mania to overturn the 2016 elections,” and uses the words “hoax,” “fake story,” “hysteria,” “frenzy,” “gambit,” “charade,” and “grotesque spectacle.” He also falsely asserts that former vice president Joe Biden “bragged that he extorted the Ukrainians into firing a prosecutor who happened to be investigating Biden’s own son.” Biden did push to fire a prosecutor who had previously investigated a firm on where his son, Hunter Biden, worked.But Biden and other Western officials said the prosecutor was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.The investigation into the firm was dormant at the time and Hunter Biden had not been accused of wrongdoing, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.“Let’s be very clear — the president did not ask to investigate Joe Biden,” McCarthy says.In the call summary released by the White House, Trump tells Ukraine’s president, “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.” When a reporter points this out, McCarthy stands his ground.“Adam B. Schiff doesn’t talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, and then millions of dollars from China,” Trump says.Hunter Biden did collect significant income from a Ukrainian company, but there is no evidence Joe Biden made money from either country, and Hunter Biden’s lawyer denies that he made any money from a China investment deal he advised.AD

3:35 p.m. Joe Biden’s presidential campaign releases a statement quoting the former vice president’s appearance the night before on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Biden said then that Trump’s efforts were “18 out of 10” on the outlandish scale.Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, says Biden deserves indirect credit for Trump’s dealings with Ukraine.“It is all borne from his deep, fully substantiated fear that Joe Biden will beat him in November 2020,” she says.She calls Trump a “lawless president.” She calls the situation “outrageous.” She calls the White House “a racket.” She says there was a “coverup.” After a clip of Trump talking plays, she adds, “He sounds like a criminal.”

As another friend and respected colleague comes out in favor of Warren, I recognize the black folk they keep polling who support Biden.Fewer — 56 percent — said they would feel the same about Biden winning the nomination.AD

Warren is less well known than Biden.Only 9 percent of those surveyed haven’t heard of Biden, who served in Congress for three decades before becoming the vice president to America’s first black president.Joe Biden did it, too.While the rest of this article focuses on recently emerging defenses, it’s worth lifting up one of the central ongoing claims made by Trump and his team: Former vice president Joe Biden was the one who acted inappropriately.The assertion here is that Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor in December 2015 because the prosecutor was investigating a company who had hired Biden’s son Hunter as a board member.Biden even bragged about withholding aid to Ukraine in early 2018 at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations.It’s not clear there was an investigation at that point into the company for which Hunter Biden worked, much less one targeting Hunter Biden.There’s been no evidence to emerge tying Joe Biden’s request to a defense of Hunter.What’s interesting here is that Trump is accusing Biden of doing what he himself stands accused of doing: withholding aid or perhaps an in-person meeting until Zelensky signed on to an investigation of Biden.What Biden did, by all accounts, is what Trump claims he himself did: took an action to push back on corruption.“… So, it’s okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it’s not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?”

Thiessen’s argument was quickly lifted up as an example of Democratic hypocrisy.It’s not investigate Trump vs. investigate Hunter Biden, as Thiessen has it.He wanted dirt on Biden.The beneficiary of tearing down Biden — Trump — is quite different than the beneficiaries of a robust Mueller probe.Trump was asking for a probe of the Bidens.One that attracted a great deal of attention was Trump’s responding to Zelensky’s mention of possibly seeking military aid by saying, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” Another was his subsequent mention of Biden:

A former top Ukrainian prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of the dirt-digging effort by Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Thursday he believed that Hunter Biden did not run afoul of any laws in Ukraine.AD

Lutsenko’s comments about Hunter Biden — which echo what he told Bloomberg News in May — were significant, because Trump and his personal attorney Giuliani have sought to stir up suspicions about both Hunter and Joe Biden’s conduct in Ukraine in recent weeks.Giuliani said in a Fox News Channel interview earlier this week that he was “operating at the request of the State Department” when he reached out to Ukrainian officials about investigating Biden.We’re hopeful that we can help him execute and achieve that.”

The Biden campaign responded to the latest revelations in Trump’s alleged efforts to seek incriminating information from Ukraine about the former vice president, claiming that Trump’s alleged actions are “all borne from his deep, fully substantiated fear that Joe Biden will beat him in November 2020.”

“An intelligence community whistleblower said, ‘I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,’” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said in a statement.“I would rather have us stay together united, Republicans and Democrats, speaking for the importance of continuing to fund aid to Ukraine, and I agree with him that even without this language, when we spend money, when we appropriate it, the president is legally obligated to spend it.”

Underlying the discussion was Trump’s decision to hold up security assistance for Ukraine until recently, as revelations emerged about his phone call with the president of Ukraine in which Trump suggested that Biden should be investigated by authorities in that country.The tweet was in response to a whistleblower from the U.S. intelligence community who alleged that Trump had improperly pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son.In another, he wrote: “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!”

Speaking at a fundraiser Wednesday night in Los Angeles, Biden said there was no proof of Trump’s allegation that he and his son Hunter Biden had conflicts of interest while he served as vice president.“This is not about me, and it really isn’t because not a single publication said anything he has ever said about me or my son is true,” Biden said.“Everyone has gone and researched it and said it’s not true.”

Biden suggested that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate him and his son because “70-something polls show that I’ll kick his … toes.” The audience burst into laughter.— Mike DeBonis

6 a.m.: Biden edges closer to calling for impeachment on ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’

Biden edged closer to calling for impeachment on Wednesday night, pointing to a rough transcript of a conversation between Trump and Ukraine’s president as evidence that Trump is likely to have committed “an impeachable offense.”

Biden, who had stopped short of calling for the president to be ousted earlier this week, adjusted his stance after the White House shared the details of a 30-minute phone call Trump made to Zelensky in July.According to the 2,000-word rough transcript, Trump repeatedly suggested that Zelensky investigate Biden, offering help from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of inviting the foreign leader to the White House.“Based on the material that they acknowledged today, it seems to me it’s awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility,” Biden said during an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

Red more here.She said there are “a number of grounds” for it but that the latest news about his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son, is “incredibly troubling.”

She compared Trump’s latest effort to spread negative stories about Biden, who is leading in most polls to be the 2020 Democratic nominee, to what he did to her during their campaign.So this is an effort to sow these falsehoods against Biden.Who is mentioned in the whistleblower complaint, and whom Trump told the Ukrainian president he should work with in the project to get dirt on Joe Biden.Much of the complaint rests on a phone call that Trump had on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he offered U.S. assistance in an investigation of Trump’s political opponents, including the son of former vice president Joe Biden.AD

“He didn’t see anything wrong with the conversation he had with a foreign leader,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), an ally of the president, referring to the call in which Trump offered his Ukrainian counterpart help from the Justice Department in investigating former vice president Joe Biden, a political rival.In the words of one former aide, “It may lead to less structured output from the White House.”

In an effort spearheaded by Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s team is also trying to refocus the discussion on Biden’s son Hunter.Giuliani has urged Republicans to forcefully attack the Bidens, although some White House staffers have been exasperated by Giuliani’s combative television appearances.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the country’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.I do not mean that this could adversely hurt former vice president Joe Biden.Trump’s wrongdoing is so egregious and Biden’s innocence is so widely accepted that the “flip the script” tactic cannot work in this case.Here, Biden does have a challenge.In all three cases, Trump’s own words incriminate him because 1) The “plain reading of the memo makes clear that the quid is funds for defense equipment, and the quo is help from Zelensky in discrediting the Mueller investigation’s findings and Trump’s potential political opponent, Joe Biden” and 2) Merely asking for help from a foreign power to help smear a private American citizen and thereby provide the president with political ammunition is a grotesque violation of the president’s oath.According to ABC News, “'It was clear that [President Donald] Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case,' said Serhiy Leshchenko, an anti-corruption advocate and former member of Ukraine’s Parliament, who now acts as an adviser to Zelensky.AD

The impeachment inquiry could test Pence’s role as a Zelig-type figure who has thus far sidestepped much of the controversy in a White House plagued by infighting, devastating leaks, indictments and intrigue.After Zelensky appears to agree to pursue the investigations Trump wants — including one involving Joe and Hunter Biden — Trump repeatedly says he will connect him with both Giuliani and Barr.It issued an extensive denial on Wednesday, saying Barr had not:

Incredible.— Wayne Anderson (@DigitalSecArch) September 25, 2019

Some of the president’s supporters, meanwhile, jumped on the CrowdStrike comments for another purpose: To undercut Democrats’ impeachment calls by arguing Trump’s real interest was in getting Zelensky to investigate the DNC breach rather than the Biden family’s business connections in Ukraine.This is NOT the same thing as the Biden section.Every article reads like the call was intended to ask them to investigate Biden and that’s just not the case.The director of DOJ’s criminal division swiftly dismissed a criminal referral from the intelligence community’s inspector general that said Trump may have broken campaign finance laws by seeking dirt on Joe Biden.Kupec, Barr’s spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son.Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a ‘prosecutor to a former prosecutor.’ But he has said that he believed something didn’t add up with the 2016 release of the ‘black ledger’ that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened.Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: ‘I’m not going to tell you about that.’”

-- Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens appears to have begun as an attempt to formulate a rationale by which the president could pardon Paul Manafort as part of an effort to undermine Mueller’s investigation, according to previously undisclosed records obtained by the New York Review of Books: “These records indicate that attorneys representing Trump and Manafort respectively had at least nine conversations relating to this effort, beginning in the early days of the Trump administration, and lasting until as recently as May of this year.-- Trump claimed Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an allegation that has been flatly denied by Biden’s lawyer.Michael Kranish reports: “Trump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, ‘Secret Empires,’ that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013.… Trump on Wednesday put it this way: ‘When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two."Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013.Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities.Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount.However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client’s role has been misconstrued.He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.”

-- Trump was fixated on attacking Biden long before his call with Zelensky, per Toluse Olorunnipa and Matt Viser: “He attacked Biden at the White House and at campaign rallies.He attacked Biden on Twitter and on Instagram.He attacked Biden in France and in Japan, during news conferences and official speeches, in phone calls and in interviews, on Air Force One and in the Rose Garden, during morning 'executive time' and in late-night tweet storms.… Trump’s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states.The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.”

-- Biden’s brother James Biden touted his ties to the former vice president’s cancer initiative during an investment pitch to a health-care firm, according to Politico: James Biden “made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden.At the time, James Biden's business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records.Frey, who had a business relationship with James Biden and his associates, had introduced the group to Integrate.James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients, Frey, [told Politico].He added that James Biden directly invoked the former vice president on the call.A spokesman for James Biden disputed Frey's account.”

The White House staffers’ incompetence caught up them.The nation's top intelligence official will be grilled about his handling of the complaint concerning Trump's interactions with Ukraine and his asking its president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son.: “Several Senate Republicans were privately stunned,” our colleague Bob Costa reports, as they “questioned the White House’s judgment after it released a rough transcript of [Trump’s] call with the Ukraine president that showed Trump offering the help of the U.S. attorney general to investigate [Biden].”

Not a good idea: “Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions with The Washington Post that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats,” our colleague writes.And Gardner largely avoided commenting on the topic: “Gardner said Trump's conversations with the president of Ukraine about Joe Biden and his family as well as a whistleblower complaint about the president's conversations with a world leader are a 'serious issue,'" Everett writes.“And, of course, Democrats on this very committee negotiated with people who they thought were Ukrainians in order to obtain nude pictures of Trump.”

Nunes misconstrued the facts in his opening statement — he said that former vice president Joe Biden solicited help from Ukraine, when the facts don’t bear that out.Several months later, after details emerged of a whistleblower complaint regarding Trump’s attempts to enlist Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a critical mass of Democrats has come out in favor of an impeachment inquiry, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced her support for one.Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe tweets: “The massive White House coverup of Trump’s abuse of power vis-a-vis Ukraine & Biden, including evidence of concealment, is now clearly documented.“He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.” (The “company” was the company that employed Hunter Biden.)Lutsenko’s comments about Hunter Biden — which echo what he told Bloomberg News in May — were significant, because Trump and his personal attorney Giuliani have sought to stir up suspicions about both Hunter and former vice president Joe Biden’s conduct in Ukraine in recent weeks.Joe Biden is leading Trump in many opinion polls ahead of the 2020 election.AD

Hunter Biden has denied any wrongdoing, and there is no evidence he was involved in any lawbreaking in his work in Ukraine with the country’s largest private gas company.“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son,” Trump told Zelensky in a July 25 phone call, a rough transcript of which was released Wednesday.Giuliani has alleged that Hunter Biden was involved in corruption during his nearly five years on the board of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company.Burisma’s owner came under scrutiny by Lutsenko’s predecessors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment, but Hunter Biden was never accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.AD

As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Lutsenko’s predecessor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.“Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,” Lutsenko said.AD

Lutsenko had earlier cast doubt on Hunter Biden’s actions in Ukraine, an effort that drew Giuliani’s notice last year.Lutsenko did not fully explain the change of heart in May when he gave an interview to Bloomberg in which he said he believed Hunter Biden had not broken any Ukrainian laws.AD

But Lutsenko said that if U.S. authorities were separately interested in Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements in Ukraine, Ukrainian law enforcement officials would be happy to comply.While it appeared that every one of the hundreds of ads placed by Trump’s campaign since Tuesday used the word “impeachment,” not a single ad placed by Joe Biden, the former vice president, used the word.Biden said this week he would favor impeachment proceedings if the White House tried to thwart congressional oversight activities.But Biden stopped short of mentioning impeachment.“New Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden bribery of Pres Poroshenko,” Giuliani tweeted on June 21, without evidence of the allegations, referring to the former president, Petro Poroshenko, whom Zelensky defeated.AD

Trump told the Ukrainian leader that he should coordinate with Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr in investigating the Democratic National Committee’s email server, which Trump suggested was in Ukraine, and probe the activities of Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.Giuliani’s in-person meetings and secretive sessions form a key component of what the whistleblower saw as “a serious or flagrant problem, abuse or violation of law or Executive Order.”

Giuliani decried any scrutiny of his conduct in a long interview Thursday, saying that more attention was finally being paid to the Biden family.During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election.Giuliani and a Ukrainian American businessman who was working with him, Lev Parnas, said those meetings included a Skype phone call last year with former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, whom Joe Biden had urged be fired.The Ukrainian official voiced his suspicions about investigations into Burisma, the energy company on whose board Hunter Biden sat for five years, and about the summer 2016 appearance in Ukraine of a black ledger tallying payments to Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman, that forced him out of his post.Biden had just helped to push out his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, amid a widespread perception in Ukraine and among its Western backers that he was perpetuating old, corruption-prone habits.He stirred up perceptions that Joe Biden had intervened into Ukraine’s justice system to quash an investigation into the gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board, meeting repeatedly with Giuliani and telling a conservative columnist at the Hill newspaper that he “would be happy” to talk to Barr about the issue.First, in May, he said in an interview with Bloomberg News that “at least as of now,” he didn’t believe that the Bidens had broken any Ukrainian laws.Then on Thursday, he declared to The Post that “on the territory of Ukraine, Hunter Biden did not violate Ukrainian legislation.”

Giuliani was livid.One of Giuliani’s main allegations is that Joe Biden pushed for Shokin’s dismissal because the prosecutor was investigating the owner of the gas company where Hunter Biden was on the board.The lawyer contributed to Biden, they contributed to — the whole thing is — but more importantly, you know what the whistleblower [complaint] is?And then you have Sleepy Joe Biden, who’s dumb as a rock.“Biden’s son.” “Ooh,” Well, then, you know, he says, “Maybe I shouldn’t get involved, you know it’s very political.” I say, “Steve, what happens when you come off a vice-presidential plane, it’s called Air Force Two, your father’s with you, you walk into a room in China and they give you a fund of $1.5 billion, billion; you make hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars off that.He would be somebody you would pay a lot of money to, but not Joe Biden’s son.According to the complaint and a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call, Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, offering assistance from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of a White House sit-down.During his speech, the president again went after Biden, the “crooked” media and the whistleblower’s complaint.Meanwhile, more than 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials signed a statement supporting an impeachment inquiry based on Trump’s pressing Zelensky during their July call to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden.Documents requested from Pompeo include a list of any State Department officials involved in the controversial July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president as well as any correspondence since Trump’s inauguration about investigations that refer to Hunter Biden, Burisma Holdings — the natural gas company the former vice president’s son worked for, among others.So I’d rather defeat the president the old-fashioned way, at the ballot box.”

12:15 p.m.: Ukraine lawmakers seek new probes into allegations at ‘epicenter’ of U.S. political battles

Lawmakers in Ukraine are seeking to launch probes into some of the same allegations at the heart of the Trump administration’s dirt-digging efforts, including possibly reopening inquiries into the Ukrainian natural gas firm with connections to Hunter Biden.A separate probe by Ukraine also has the potential to add fuel to White House efforts to fire up President Trump’s base and lend legitimacy to his demands for Ukrainian prosecutors to look again at corruption allegations against Hunter Biden, despite no evidence of wrongdoing related to his work in Ukraine.Pelosi was referring to the fact that Trump had suspended military aid to Ukraine at the time of the phone conversation with Zelensky, in which he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens.Privately, Pelosi told Democrats upon announcing her support for an impeachment inquiry Tuesday that the probe would move “expeditiously” to capitalize on public outrage over the revelation that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate potential 2020 Democratic rival and former vice president Joe Biden.In interviews this week, Giuliani has rejected any scrutiny of his conduct, saying attention instead should be put on his claims about former vice president Joe Biden and the Democrats.A U.S. intelligence official’s whistleblower complaint released publicly Thursday details efforts by President Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.The prosecutor general also alleged that Joe Biden, then the vice president, had pressured the sitting Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, to close a purported criminal probe of an energy company for which Biden’s son Hunter was a board member.[Former Ukraine prosecutor says Hunter Biden ‘did not violate anything’]

In early July, Trump directly requested that the Office of Budget and Management withhold nearly $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine.On the call, Trump twice brought up that the United States had been “very, very good to Ukraine” before requesting investigations of 2016 election interference and alleged wrongdoings by the Biden family.On Sept. 5, the first mentions of the whistleblower complaint are made public when The Washington Post’s editorial board wrote that it had been “reliably told” that Trump was “attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.”

Hunter Biden: Son of former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden.No evidence suggests Hunter Biden was involved in any lawbreaking.Trump commonly assigns his political enemies nicknames that sound like 1920s-era cartoon characters — “Sleepy Joe” Biden, “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz,” etc.Trump appears to be counting on that confusion to offer a fog of claims and allegations to make it appear as if Biden had done something wrong.False: Biden pushed out a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating his son

Trump has falsely claimed that Biden in 2015 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating Ukraine’s largest private gas company, Burisma, which had added Biden’s son, Hunter, to its board in 2014.AD

AD

There are two big problems with this claim: One, Shokin was not investigating Burisma or Hunter Biden, and two, Shokin’s ouster was considered a diplomatic victory.Biden was among the many Western officials who pressed for the removal of Shokin because he actually was not investigating the corruption endemic to the country.“And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.”

AD

AD

In a 2018 appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden bragged about his role in Shokin’s removal, saying he had withheld $1 billion in loan guarantees as leverage to force action.But Biden was carrying out a policy developed at the State Department and coordinated with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and “Joe Biden’s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,” said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms.In December 2015, Biden traveled to Kiev and decried the “cancer of corruption” in the country in a speech to the parliament.Shokin was removed from office three months later, and Biden announced April 15 that the loan guarantee would go forward; the agreement between the United States and Ukraine was signed June 3.AD

AD

One can certainly raise questions about Hunter Biden’s judgment in joining Burisma’s board at a time his father had a high-profile role in working with Ukraine’s government.But by continuing to claim that Biden “did” something for his son, Trump persists in spreading a false narrative about a diplomatic maneuver hailed at the time as a step toward reducing corruption in Ukraine.False: Hunter Biden made a killing on a China deal

At various times Trump has claimed Hunter Biden “made millions of dollars from China” or “walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund” after hitching a ride with his father on Air Force Two.AD

In December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew from Japan to China with Joe Biden on Air Force Two as the vice president embarked on a diplomatic mission.AD

Twelve days after he flew to Beijing, Hunter Biden joined an advisory board of a fund called BHR Partners, which had announced it would try to raise $1.5 billion.The New Yorker magazine reported that during the trip Hunter Biden arranged for his father to shake hands with Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund and was one of the partners who had formed BHR.But while Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden was only on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said he only took an equity stake in 2017, after Joe Biden was no longer vice president.AD

Mesires told The Fact Checker that the investment management company “was capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB [Chinese Renminbi], or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion.” Because Biden acquired a 10 percent minority interest, his “capital commitment is approximately $420,000,” Mesires said.AD

“To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,” Mesires added.False: Biden lied about talking to his son

After the reports on Hunter Biden’s business deals emerged, Joe Biden told reporters: “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

AD

Trump claimed that this was a lie because “he’s already said he spoke to his son.” But Biden had not.In any case, Biden never said he spoke to his son, as Trump claimed he did.False: Democratic senators also threatened Ukraine’s aid

Trump claimed that three Democratic senators — Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.) — “implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn’t do the right thing they wouldn’t get any assistance.” He later referred to “senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things.”

AD

AD

Trump suggested this was the “real deal,” unlike allegations that he held up military aid to force the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden.”

It’s like someone on trial for murdering his cousin telling the jury, “I haven’t murdered anyone, but I did murder my cousin.”

AD

AD

This inquiry could fail to uncover a single new fact, and Trump would still have merited impeachment and removal.All the way back in May, Giuliani quite publicly announced that he was going to Ukraine to pressure officials to find something to smear Biden.AD

AD

Giuliani was not merely freelancing; he was in regular communication with the president about the Biden project.In remarks to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations on Thursday morning, Trump said he discussed Biden’s China work with Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the investment company Blackstone.After alleging that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from the Chinese, Trump said he asked Schwarzman, “Steve, is that possible?” Trump said Schwarzman asked, “Who got that?” and Trump responded, “Biden’s son.”

Trump said he asked Schwarzman how that could happen, and the executive responded: “Maybe I shouldn’t get involved, you know it’s very political.”

Schwarzman declined to comment.His spokeswoman, Jennifer Friedman, said in a statement that “Steve never spoke to the President about Joe Biden or his family, nor has he had any conversations with the Chinese about Biden or his family.”

AD

Schwarzman wrote in his just-published autobiography, “What It Takes,” that he traveled to Beijing eight times in 2018 “on behalf” of the Trump administration during trade negotiations.Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, said Trump’s remarks were part of a pattern of spreading untruths about Hunter Biden, and he criticized Trump for “discussing his discredited conspiracy theories with an unaccountable, private envoy to a foreign country.”

AD

Trump for months has alleged that Hunter Biden has made a fortune from business dealings in Ukraine and China due to his father’s connections.Earlier this week, a summary of Trump’s telephone conversation with Ukraine’s president showed that he wanted an investigation into the younger Biden, who got a job at a gas company in that country when his father handled U.S. policy there.AD

Six months before Hunter Biden got the job in Ukraine, he arrived in Beijing on Air Force Two with his father, who had traveled to China to talk with that country’s officials.Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of an investment firm whose partners included Chinese entities.AD

Hunter Biden’s lawyer, George Mesires, said that his client did not acquire a financial stake in the investment company until October 2017, a 10 percent holding that was worth $430,000 in July.Nonetheless, Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have for months said that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion for the fund and have cited it as evidence of what they call corruption.AD

Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer who has been actively involved in urging Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, said in an interview that he had done no investigation of Hunter Biden in China, had not spoken with any Chinese officials and had not traveled to the country to look into the matter.AD

Trump on Wednesday said that Hunter Biden “walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two.I think it’s a horrible thing.”

Then, speaking privately to members of the U.S. Mission at the United Nations on Thursday, he recounted his conversation about Hunter Biden’s actions with Schwarzman.This will place individual in much more dangerous situation, not only in their professional world but also their possible personal safety.”

Trump’s troubles will increase as his smear of former vice president Joe Biden collapses.“In his strongest comment yet on the Ukraine controversy, former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate, claimed President Trump was trying to ‘hijack an election’ by asking Ukraine for help.At a fundraising reception in San Marino, California, Biden told donors, ‘He’d like to get foreign help to win elections.’ ”

AD

AD

If Republican senators find polls troubling, he could be right.For months earlier, Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani had been trying to gin up evidence supporting his theory that Biden had called for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor in early 2016 to protect his son Hunter.Some observers suggested that there may have been an explicit quid pro quo suggested by Trump — investigate Biden and then get the cash — though that wasn’t generally the understanding in reported coverage.AD

One underappreciated point is that Trump was demonstrably aware of Giuliani’s debunked theory about the Bidens — that Joe Biden had threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine to oust a prosecutor threatening his son — long before the Zelensky call and before the aid to Ukraine was halted.That it was included in the complaint, though, suggests that it has relevance to the issue of Trump’s efforts to push Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.He’s mentioned repeatedly in the whistleblower’s complaint as advocating for a probe of the Bidens.Beginning in mid-May, the whistleblower writes, “State Department officials, including Ambassadors Volker and [Ambassador to the European Union Gordon] Sondland, had spoken with Mr. Giuliani in an attempt to ‘contain the damage’ to U.S. national security.” Volker and Sondland also traveled to Kiev after the July 25 call, the whistleblower claims, to “[provide] advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to ‘navigate’ the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelensky.”

Why is former prosecutor Viktor Shokin so adamant about Biden’s involvement in his firing?At the center of the Giuliani-Trump effort is this claim that Biden threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine to force the ouster of then-general prosecutor Viktor Shokin.Subsequent reporting has indicated that there was no link between that effort, which was supported by others in the administration and by other international actors, and Hunter Biden’s role as a board member of a Ukrainian energy company.The Giuliani-Trump theory is that Shokin was investigating that company, Burisma, though there’s no evidence that such an investigation was active at the time, that Hunter Biden would be implicated in any way or that Biden’s motivation for calling for Shokin’s ouster was related to Burisma.In a sworn affidavit filed earlier this month and obtained by the Hill’s John Solomon — another central figure in the Giuliani-Trump-Ukraine universe — Shokin claims that his firing occurred “solely on the demands of the U.S. Vice President, Joe Biden, because [he] refused to cease [his] probe into Burisma (in which Biden had significant interests)".It’s not clear if there is legal weight to the affidavit (if, that is, he faces perjury penalties if it is knowingly inaccurate) and it’s certainly true that he has an ax to grind with Biden (per his own admission).He is, however, the primary dissenter from the weight of evidence suggesting that Biden’s call for his firing was objective in nature.The Post reports that a group of lawmakers in Ukraine are seeking to launch a new probe into Burisma Holdings, the gas company where Joe Biden’s son Hunter served on the board during his father’s time as vice president.The younger Biden has not been accused of wrongdoing.AD

AD

3:41 p.m. Trump previews how he hopes the impeachment fight will play out in the 2020 election if Biden becomes the Democratic nominee.“Biden promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son’s company,” the narrator says, over ominous music.Biden threatened to withhold aid that had been promised to Ukraine if it did not fire the prosecutor; he did not promise to give $1 billion for doing so.The Ukranian prosecutor in question did not have an active investigation of the company where Biden’s son worked at the time.Biden’s son was never a subject of the investigation.The Democrat’s current impeachment investigation focuses on Trump’s specific request to the current Ukrainian president for aid in an investigation of Biden, his political rival.Among them, the complaint says, was the rough transcript of the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged his foreign counterpart to mount investigations that would potentially deliver damaging information about Biden and his family.AD

An approximate transcript released by the White House shows Trump prodding Zelensky to direct his government’s investigative bodies to turn their attention to alleged corruption by an energy company for which Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, had served as a board member.AD

Trump has alleged that the elder Biden used his influence to shut down a corruption investigation targeting the company.The claim has been repeatedly discredited, and there is no credible public allegation that Hunter Biden was guilty of wrongdoing.Trump also urged Zelensky to “meet or speak with” Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr to redouble Ukraine’s efforts to seek damaging material tied to Biden.Yet, for months she’s been overshadowed in the center by former vice president Joe Biden, who, like her, contends he’s a champion of working-class Midwestern voters and union members and knows how to work with Republicans to get legislation passed.While most Democratic candidates have publicly challenged Biden — questioning his age and his comments on racial issues, among other things — Klobuchar largely has refrained and has even come to Biden’s defense.When asked why she thinks she would have a better shot at winning Rust Belt states than Biden, who grew up in Pennsylvania, Klobuchar says that she is “actually from the Midwest,” is a woman and is “in a new generation of politicians.” (At 59, she is 17 years younger than Biden.)The president, they say, did nothing wrong by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate one of his chief 2020 rivals, former vice president Joe Biden, because he never framed the request as an explicit quid pro quo in exchange for military aid.Yet Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), describing the threshold for a quid pro quo, suggested the president would have needed to say something like, “‘Uh, hey pal, you know, you need to like, go after the Bidens or I ain’t gonna give you any money.’ He’d be really, like, thuggish about it.”

Some election law experts say Graham has a point: Through a series of decisions over the past two decades, courts have raised the bar almost impossibly high for prosecutors seeking to prove public officials have traded their power for personal gain.White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted it:

“In interviews with The Washington Post, Giuliani said that, in his capacity as Trump’s personal lawyer, he had met with five current and former Ukrainian prosecutors since last year.During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election.” Rudy also helped push out a U.S. ambassador: “Her embassy was keeping five different people from giving us information,” Giuliani told our colleagues.The congressman made the case that Trump prodding his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden was “lawful conduct.” He claimed without evidence that the whistleblower was “wrong in numerous respects” and dubiously compared the complaint to the “Steele dossier” in the Russia investigation.Paul Sonne, Michael Birnbaum, Rosalind S. Helderman and Josh Dawsey report: “Giuliani decried any scrutiny of his conduct in a long interview Thursday, saying that more attention was finally being paid to the Biden family.... During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election.… A former Ukrainian prosecutor said he believed the officials were angling to provide Giuliani with compromising information at least partly to advance their own careers — and win U.S. backing for their position within the often rough-and-tumble world of Ukrainian politics.”

-- A former top Ukraine prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of Giuliani’s dirt-digging effort, said Hunter Biden “did not violate anything.” Michael Birnbaum, David L. Stern and Natalie Gryvnyak report: “‘From the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,’ former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of [the whistleblower's complaint] … ‘Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,’ Lutsenko said.Lutsenko had earlier cast doubt on Hunter Biden’s actions in Ukraine, an effort that drew Giuliani’s notice last year.Lutsenko did not fully explain the change of heart in May when he gave an interview to Bloomberg in which he said he believed Hunter Biden had not broken any Ukrainian laws.But Lutsenko said that if U.S. authorities were separately interested in Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements in Ukraine, Ukrainian law enforcement officials would be happy to comply.”

According to a whistleblower complaint released Thursday, after the 30-minute call between the two presidents in which Trump encouraged an investigation into Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and asked Zelensky to work with Attorney General William P. Barr and Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, White House lawyers took unusual steps to keep the call’s contents hidden.Any attempt to impeach Trump is going to invite the nastiest kinds of backlash, first of all against Joe Biden.”

In St. Clair Shores, a sharply split district in Detroit’s northern suburbs, Diana Rascano, 69, said she often votes for Democrats in local elections, where government “touches your life more than the feds.” But in presidential votes, she’s a consistent Republican because of her conservative views on abortion, immigration and taxes.He’s convinced that the “real criminals” are Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who have been the target of Trump’s counterattack this week.Most have been more careful and less candid than Van Drew, who said he was underwhelmed by the rough transcript of the call, in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General William P. Barr and personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.A separate probe by Ukraine also has the potential to add sizzle to White House efforts to charge up President Trump’s base and lend legitimacy to his demands for Ukrainian prosecutors to look again at corruption allegations — despite no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.AD

“Ukraine is already in the epicenter,” he said, “to put it mildly.”

The whistleblower complaint made public Thursday alleges a wide-ranging effort by Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, son of former vice president Joe Biden, and others.AD

On Thursday, Ukraine’s former prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, said that Hunter Biden “did not violate” any Ukrainian laws during Lutsenko’s tenure from May 2016 until this past August.Those could involve alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and inquests into claims of money laundering and abuse by the gas company Burisma Holdings, whose board once included the younger Biden.AD

As the eastern Ukraine conflict erupted in 2014, Nalyvaichenko was in frequent contact with top U.S. policymakers, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry, and the State Department official then in charge of Russia and Ukraine, Victoria Nuland.Giuliani has accused Joe Biden of pushing for the 2016 dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to halt an ongoing inquiry into Burisma.AD

AD

Joe Biden, however, said he was actually pushing for Shokin’s ouster because he was too soft on corruption, a view shared by many Western officials in Kiev.Both Joe and Hunter Biden have denied any improper action.That would mean that the investigation would be unlikely to focus on the actions of either Biden.“It’s better for us to be open and transparent, rather than put it in a suitcase and look like we’re selling it to Trump or Biden.”The president asked Zelensky to work with Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and for help in finding the Democratic National Committee computer server that U.S. officials say was hacked by Russian intelligence in the run-up to the 2016 election.“And having someone else coming and representing the president and giving them a different message which is ‘we want you to find as much dirt as you can on the vice president’s son’ sends a mixed message.”

For months, Giuliani has been pressing the Ukrainian government behind the scenes, gathering information about Biden and briefing Trump on his findings, Giuliani told The Washington Post.Andrew Weiss, a Russia scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Giuliani’s efforts to launch an investigation into Biden’s son came at a particularly sensitive time in U.S.-Ukraine relations given the surprise victory of Zelensky, a political novice and former comedian, over President Petro Poroshenko this spring.AD

Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a “prosecutor to a former prosecutor.” But he has said that he believed something didn’t add up with the 2016 release of the “black ledger” that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened.Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: “I’m not going to tell you about that.”

After Trump and Zelensky discussed European support for Ukraine, the rough transcript of the phone call indicates that Trump pressed Zelensky to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney General on an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden’s involvement in Ukraine during his time in office.Biden, who is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, threatened to withhold U.S. loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor was fired, citing allegations that the prosecutor was not cracking down on corruption.Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been scrutinized by Ukrainian authorities, but no evidence has emerged that Biden pushed for the prosecutor to step down to benefit his son.AD

The anonymous whistleblower raised concerns that Trump used his position as president to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, one of Trump’s political rivals, ahead of the 2020 election.Legal experts say House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) decision to announce a formal impeachment inquiry — following revelations about the president’s efforts to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — won’t necessarily yield Democrats new leverage in their court fight with the administration over key Trump documents.Also in the memo recounting the July 25 conversation between Trump and Zelensky, Trump suggests that former vice president Joe Biden “went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution” of his son Hunter Biden, echoing nearly verbatim claims made by Hannity earlier this year.Around the time of Hannity’s claims, Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani — who is a bit of a conspiracy theorist himself and is friendly toward Hannity — was reportedly planning to pressure Ukraine to investigate the genesis of the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and also Hunter Biden’s employment by a Ukrainian gas company.Baseless claims about the 2016 election and Joe Biden’s past dealings have been resuscitated in the run-up to the 2020 election as Biden emerged as a Democratic primary front-runner in polls.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019

In the readout of their private conversation, Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to work with the U.S. attorney general to investigate the conduct of Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.In June, around the time that he was pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden’s son, he told ABC News in an interview that he would accept information about a rival from a foreign government.As Congress considers impeaching him over his request that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his family as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukrainians worked with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election, Trump is claiming a broad conspiracy to erase history.Those efforts appear to have been aimed at separating Giuliani’s interest in investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter from official U.S. dealings with the Ukrainian government.AD

Giuliani has long been a proponent of unsubstantiated theories that Biden’s son Hunter profited improperly from work in Ukraine and that as vice president, Joe Biden helped wave off a Ukraine corruption investigation that could have ensnared his son.AD

I cannot figure out why Democrats, particularly former vice president Joe Biden, have not started to call out “Traitorous Trump” for his habit of sabotaging U.S. elections for his own benefit.Among those targeted is Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine):

Democratic presidential candidates all should be decrying Trump’s Ukraine gambit, and yet Beto O’Rourke is the only one to say flat-out that Trump is assaulting not just Biden but all of the candidates, as well as democracy itself.The former Texas congressman tweeted about Trump’s scurrilous ad attempting to shift attention from his impeachable conduct to Biden and his son, “Trump’s ad about Joe Biden is a disgrace.If the plan is to sit back and let Biden twist in the wind, they are making a grave political and moral mistake.AD

At issue is Trump’s pressing Zelensky on the call to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukrainians worked with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.Trump’s reelection campaign announced Friday that it will launch a television ad “highlighting Joe Biden’s Ukraine scandal and the Democrats’ plan to use it to steal the 2020 election by impeaching the President.”

AD

Republicans have mostly lined up to support Trump, echoing his claim that the call was “perfect” and that his willingness to release both a transcript of it and a version of the whistleblower complaint serve to show he has nothing to hide.In the phone call, Trump makes multiple references to how good the United States is to Ukraine, and Zelensky then refers to buying U.S. military weaponry — “Javelins.” Trump then quickly launches into a “favor” he wants, an investigation related to the 2016 election, and then mentions another investigation, related to Joe and Hunter Biden.An intelligence community whistleblower said President Trump may have improperly pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, prompting lawmakers to consider impeachment.AD

AD

Then it was the memorandum detailing the July 25 telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the president sought help — “a favor” — in finding hacked servers and later suggested Ukraine undertake an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who for a time sat on the board of a Ukrainian company that had come under scrutiny.AD

The existence of the probe follows revelations that the president used multiple levers of his office to pressure the leader of Ukraine to pursue investigations that Trump hoped would produce damaging information about Democrats, including potential presidential rival Joe Biden.Trump faces impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives in the wake of a whistleblower report by a CIA officer exposing Trump’s efforts on a July 25 call to pressure the leader of Ukraine to pursue investigations that Trump hoped would generate embarrassing material about Biden.AD

During that call, Trump urged Zelensky to work with Attorney General William P. Barr on a possible investigation into Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian gas company that had recruited him as a member of its board.Biden’s role came to Trump’s attention as the president’s associates — among them Rudolph W. Giuliani — sought to undermine accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 election.AD

It was a gas company, Burisma, that brought Biden on board in 2014, in an apparent effort to clean up its image following the ouster of the graft-ridden Yanukovych administration.On Friday, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine announced that the investigation covered the years 2010-2012 — during the Yanukovych years and before Biden joined the board.), whose steady march in popularity has eroded Biden’s standing and given her narrow leads over him in several recent polls in early-voting states.You have to recalibrate based on the fact that Trump’s attacks on you are going to be at the center of these impeachment hearings,” said Larry Rasky, a longtime ally of Biden who had senior roles in his two previous presidential campaigns.Rasky said he worries Biden’s campaign has been naive about the amount of resources needed to counter Trump.The new demand that Biden simultaneously run a general-election matchup with Trump and a primary campaign against several formidable Democratic challengers risks straining a campaign that started later and has organized more slowly than some of his rivals’ efforts.Biden’s campaign for now seems to have settled on an approach similar to the one Democrats used in the 2018 midterms, trying to ignore Trump as much as possible to focus instead on issues they believe are more resonant with voters.AD

AD

Biden, who has insisted his election would return the country to normalcy, has over the past several days largely sought to avoid the political spasm in which he is now a central figure.At a fundraiser Saturday in Park City, Utah, the host, Barry Baker, called Trump a “lying, narcissistic traitor, cheater,” while Biden over the course of a 20-minute speech did not mention impeachment or the president’s dealings with Ukraine.It’s a tactic that’s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives,” Biden said last week.AD

AD

Biden has sent out a string of fundraising emails — which his campaign says resulted in its best donation week since early in the campaign — and some longtime confidants hope he can avoid getting dragged into Trump’s bombastic antagonism.They have called or messaged Biden and urged him to avoid getting into a bitter back-and-forth with the president, reminding him that the political landscape is littered with foes whose character Trump has dirtied.“For Joe Biden to get down in the mud with this guy, whatever stank on him will run off on Joe,” said Dick Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator from South Carolina and a longtime Biden supporter.Yet the benefit to Biden, as some of his advisers see it, is the possibility that Democrats will view his response as statesmanlike and rally behind him amid attacks they see as unfair.“Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi are the three most important people in American politics right now,” said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Polk County Democrats in Iowa, who is neutral in the race.It seems everybody else is playing catch-up; they are trying to get the limelight back.”

Trump has delved into exaggeration and falsehoods in his fusillade of accusations against Biden.Yet the episode also has raised the uncomfortable question for Biden about whether he should have allowed his son to make money from a Ukrainian company at the same time he was overseeing the Obama administration’s efforts to crack down on corruption there.Already, several of Biden’s presidential foes have obliquely engaged on that topic.Ed Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor and a top Biden supporter, said he thought Biden has handled the issue “just perfectly” so far, but he quickly added that it’s hard to tell whether the accusations will have a lingering impact.“But some might worry that if Biden gets elected, there will be all sorts of grand juries, and Republicans will look into this stuff.Not that Democrats believe Joe would do anything corrupt, but just that it would be charge and countercharge.”

The episode has crystallized an existing sense of anxiety among some of Biden’s top donors and longtime supporters about his campaign.Some allies have been expressing concerns for weeks that Biden doesn’t seem to be the happy warrior he had been in previous campaigns.Some of those worries have led to preliminary discussions, in Chicago and Washington, over whether to launch a pro-Biden super PAC.Among those involved have been Rasky; former Biden staffer Mark Doyle; Julianna Smoot, a Democratic fundraiser who led Barack Obama’s campaign finance team in 2008 and was deputy campaign manager in 2012; and Democratic consultant Mark Riddle.AD

In a sign of what Biden is up against, the Trump campaign announced Friday the $10 million ad campaign focused on Biden, his son and Ukraine.It includes a video snippet of Biden saying the United States would withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee if Ukraine did not fire the corrupt prosecutor.Don’t let them.”

The Biden campaign has attempted to reassure donors and has sent out talking points to allies to encourage a public response to Trump.“We’re in a battle for the soul of this nation, and Donald Trump just revealed to the entire world how terrified he is that he’ll lose it to Joe Biden,” Andrew Bates, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement.“That’s because the contrast between the vice president and Donald Trump couldn’t be more powerful.”

On Sunday, two top Biden campaign officials sent a letter to the heads of major news and cable networks, urging them not to book Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.While conceding that they are in a highly unpredictable environment, Biden advisers say their candidate will ultimately benefit from contrasts with Trump over issues and leadership.“A lot of us who know Joe Biden think it’s incredibly unfair,” said Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration.As voters, we should say, ‘Hell no, we’re not going to do that.’ ”

Vilsack, who remains uncommitted in the Democratic primary, said voters should focus on how Biden has avoided getting caught up in personal attacks.“The Biden campaign seems to be able to handle the attacks,” he said.Afterward, she dropped rapidly in the polls; she has risen steadily over the past six months at a time when Biden was bearing the brunt of Trump’s criticism.Alan Feirer, the party chairman in Madison County, Iowa, has expressed some skepticism of Biden in the past but said he is impressed by how he handled the past week.pic.twitter.com/nkG2o3ksth — FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) September 29, 2019

House Democrats last week began an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions after the release of the whistleblower complaint as well as a rough transcript of a July phone call in which Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden, who is leading in polls for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.AD

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.As vice president, Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.An ABC News-Ipsos poll released Sunday showed that 63 percent of adults say it is a serious problem that Trump pushed Zelensky to look at Hunter Biden.In an appearance on “State of the Union,” he referred to “The Godfather,” saying Trump used a “high-pressure tactic’’ by asking for an investigation of the Bidens.Giuliani has attempted to convince the country that when Joe Biden served as vice president, he sought and secured the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor — Viktor Shokin — who was pursuing a case against an energy company, Burisma Holdings, where his son Hunter Biden served on the board of directors.In fact, the reporting points in the other direction — that Joe Biden was acting in accordance with an international consensus, not to mention a well-cemented position within the U.S. government and that Shokin wasn’t actively pursuing Burisma at the time in any case.On this front, the Biden campaign’s letter credits the news organizations: “While you have been aggressive in pushing back on him in real time, it is well known that the dedicated liar always has the advantage, pushing out outlandish falsehoods and disinformation in the knowledge that it is hard for the corrections to catch up,” notes the letter from the Biden campaign.In this vein, the Biden letter merges with a million pleas from social media users dating to the onset of the Trump presidential period.The Biden campaign letter is a well-phrased appeal that will in all likelihood go nowhere.To take a quote from the Biden campaign letter: “Giuliani is not enlightening your viewers in any way.Most Democrats, including many Judiciary members, see the Intelligence panel as the more appropriate venue for investigating Trump’s July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he asked the foreign leader to help dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter.Joe Biden has done something wrong.Joe Biden has done something very wrong.AD

Trump’s egregious behavior in trying to bring down Joe Biden by itself encompasses nearly every transgression of his presidency: lies, coverups and the selfish misuse of power; putting his own interests ahead of our nation’s security; and an arrogant and unconstitutional dismissal of Congress’s legitimate authority.The region was so unsettled that one of Hunter Biden’s investment firm partners at the time — former secretary of state John F. Kerry’s stepson — believed that joining the board of Burisma Holdings was a bad idea and ended his business relationship with Biden and another partner, his spokesman told The Washington Post.AD

Now, more than five years later, with Joe Biden running for president, Hunter Biden’s decision to get involved with the Ukrainian firm is the backdrop of an extraordinary whistleblower complaint against President Trump that is reshaping the 2020 political landscape.Revelations that Trump, along with his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, pressed the Ukrainians to pursue investigations into Burisma and examine the role of the Bidens have triggered an impeachment inquiry in the House, with allegations that Trump withheld U.S. support for Ukraine to ensure Kiev investigated his potential rival in the presidential election.No evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the Bidens has surfaced.Giuliani’s primary allegation — that Joe Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine’s top prosecutor to quash a probe into the former minister and Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky — is not substantiated and has been widely disputed by former U.S. officials and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists.AD

AD

Still, Hunter Biden’s decision to associate himself with the company has raised an uncomfortable question the Biden campaign is struggling to explain: Why didn’t the vice president take steps to head off a perceived conflict of interest between his efforts to crack down on corruption in Ukraine and his son’s work for a gas tycoon investigated for abusing his position as a government official?“Why didn’t Joe Biden tell Hunter, ‘Come off it.For some Ukrainians, Hunter Biden’s association with Burisma undermined his father’s calls to end corruption in Ukraine.Former U.S. officials who worked with Biden maintain that his son’s activities in no way influenced his actions regarding Ukraine as vice president.No.”

At the time, the White House said that Hunter Biden was a private citizen and that the vice president didn’t endorse any company in Ukraine.While vice president, Joe Biden did not comment publicly on his son’s role at Burisma.AD

What specific duties Hunter Biden carried out for Burisma are not fully known.A lawyer for Hunter Biden, George R. Mesires, declined to say how much his client earned, or whether the vice president’s son knew the company’s owner was in the crosshairs of authorities when he joined.AD

Questions about Hunter Biden’s activities in Ukraine “distract focus from the President’s and Mr. Giuliani’s own wrongdoing by re-asking questions that have been answered to the full satisfaction of everyone who initially scrutinized Hunter’s conduct,” Mesires said in a statement.AD

The Biden campaign declined to say why Joe Biden didn’t ask his son to leave Burisma’s board to avoid any perceived conflict of interest.“Joe Biden proudly fought for reform in Ukraine and his achievement of a goal the U.S., EU, IMF, and entire Ukrainian anti-corruption community all strongly supported was a profound victory for good government there,” Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement.AD

“The Obama-Biden Administration created and upheld the strongest ethics policy of any presidency in American history, and the desperate smear campaign that Donald Trump was just caught trying to ensnare Ukraine into has been comprehensively discredited,” Bates added.Changing political tide

Hunter Biden became involved in Ukraine at a chaotic political moment for the former Soviet republic.However, Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau said Friday that it was still probing licenses granted to Burisma during the years Zlochevsky was ecology minister, which predate Hunter Biden’s relationship with the firm.A Western makeover

Hunter Biden joined Burisma less than two months after U.K. authorities opened the money-laundering investigation.A month before Hunter Biden joined Burisma’s board, his father traveled to Ukraine as vice president and announced an aid package designed to enable Ukraine to boost its energy production.“Imagine where you’d be today if you were able to tell Russia: ‘Keep your gas,’ ” Biden said.Fathers and sons

For years, Hunter Biden’s business dealings — including a stint as a K Street lobbyist while his father was a U.S. senator — have been difficult topics for staffers to discuss with the former vice president, according to those who have worked with him.Hunter Biden survived a 1972 car accident that killed his mother and sister.And Hunter Biden has struggled with addiction and financial difficulties in recent years, according to filings from his 2017 divorce.Soon, Hunter Biden received his own invitation.Mr. Archer stated that he and Hunter Biden intended to pursue the opportunity as individuals, not as part of the firm,” Heinz spokesman Chris Bastardi told The Post.“The lack of judgment in this matter was a major catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his business relationships with Mr. Archer and Mr. Biden,” Bastardi said, adding that Heinz and his investment firm were never involved with Burisma.Mesires, Hunter Biden’s attorney, did not respond to a question about whether Hunter Biden knew of Heinz’s warning.Hunter Biden told The Post earlier this year that he joined the company at the urging of another board member, the former president of Poland, Aleksander Kwasniewski.In a statement, Biden said they shared a belief that Ukrainian energy independence was critical to rebuffing Russian President Vladimir Putin.Hunter Biden brought knowledge of international politics to the board, which met twice a year, the former Polish president said in an interview, recalling how he told the vice president’s son, “I am sure this company is very important for the independence of Ukraine.”

Apter, the investment banker who chairs the board, said at the time that the selection of the vice president’s son “was totally based on merit.”

Biden campaign officials said Joe Biden learned of Hunter’s appointment to Burisma’s board of directors only from media reports.In a statement to The Post earlier this year, Hunter Biden said, “At no time have I discussed with my father the company’s business or my board service.” Joe Biden echoed the sentiment recently, speaking in Iowa.He said, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

Hunter Biden told the New Yorker that his father alluded to his Burisma job just once.When he joined, Burisma officials said Biden would oversee its legal affairs.U.S. officials selected Biden — the primary messenger for the administration’s Ukraine policy at the time — to underscore the discontent.During a 2015 speech before the Ukrainian parliament, Biden called for the country to root out corruption and said, “The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform.”

Biden later recounted telling Poroshenko more bluntly that the United States would withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee if action was not taken against Shokin.If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,’ ” Biden said during a 2018 speech before the Council on Foreign Relations.And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

Shokin — who has provided information about Biden to Giuliani — told The Post earlier this year that he believes he was ousted in March 2016 because he was investigating Burisma.If he had been allowed to remain in the job, he would have questioned Hunter Biden’s qualifications to be a board member, he said, noting that “this person had no work experience in Ukraine or in the energy sector.”

But at the time, the Zlochevsky case was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.Bullough said that the central allegation Giuliani has made against Biden, “this idea that he had Shokin sacked to protect Zlochevsky and Burisma, is just nonsense.” Under Shokin, he noted, the prosecutor’s office endured a scandal in which top officials were allegedly caught with stashes of diamonds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.“But the separate truth is: Should Joe Biden have prevented his son from essentially trading off the Biden name?” Bullough asked.“Maybe he should have.”

Shokin’s successor, Yuri Lutsenko, whose comments at one point helped boost Giuliani’s efforts to raise questions about the Biden investigation, said in an interview with The Post that he believed Hunter Biden didn’t run afoul of any laws in Ukraine.It wasn’t until this May, just after Joe Biden launched his presidential bid, that Hunter Biden decided not to serve another term on Burisma’s board.“I would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them,” Hunter Biden told the New Yorker for a lengthy story in July that detailed his personal difficulties and history of substance abuse.AD

“I don’t know who was preparing [Zelensky] for this conversation,” he said, “but 100 percent they made a mistake.”

He said Zelensky should have deflected Trump’s suggestion that he investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter and returned to issues that are actually important to Ukraine, such as military aid, sanctions on Russia and the effort to arrange a settlement in the breakaway regions in the east.Another member of parliament, Alyona Shkrum, argued that the scandal really dates to Poroshenko’s presidency, when Rudolph W. Giuliani began meeting with Ukranian prosecutors and making inquiries about the Bidens.Now, Republicans have been pushing Ukrainian prosecutors to pursue the Bidens.— senators who are either facing competitive reelection campaigns next November or those who have publicly voiced discomfort with Trump’s behavior as he urged Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his family.AD

Both surveys come as Trump is coming under increasing scrutiny for a July phone call in which he urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden at a time when the White House had suspended military aid to Ukraine.On Monday, pressure on the White House escalated as three House committees issued a subpoena to Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, demanding that he turn over all records pertaining to his contacts regarding Ukraine, the Biden family and related matters.Former vice president Joe Biden spent a few minutes discussing impeachment at a recent stop before turning to an abbreviated version of his usual speech.“It definitely throws a monkey wrench into everybody’s talking points,” said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who supports Biden and endorsed an impeachment inquiry for the first time last week.AD

As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who many Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption.Despite the centrality of his role, Biden has been more reticent than some of his rivals when it comes to impeachment.AD

At a recent fundraiser in Southern California, Biden said that he and his family had done nothing wrong and accused Trump of trying to “hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.” He added, “This is not about me.”

Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark who has donated to Biden and other candidates this year, said he sees both opportunity and peril for the former vice president.At the same time, Gifford said, it could prompt some Democrats to question whether the Ukraine situation would be a vulnerability for Biden — chipping away at his assertion that he’s the most electable Democrat — and “those questions have to be answered.”

In the meantime, the drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.The ad hoc counter-impeachment effort developing around Trump underscores the risk the president faces as Democratic leaders plan to launch a probe aimed at proving that Trump abused his presidential powers in asking Ukraine’s president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his family, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukrainians worked with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election.“We are on offense to show the American people this is a coup d’etat by elitist bureaucrats and Democrats.”

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham accused the media of “hysteria” and said Trump had “done nothing wrong” in a phone call in which he encouraged Ukraine’s president to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over the younger Biden’s former position with a Ukranian private gas company — an arrangement that Trump and his allies say was corrupt.AD

That complaint centers on a July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the U.S. president presses his counterpart into launching investigations related to a 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019

House Democrats last week began an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions tied to the call, in which Trump repeatedly urged Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender for the presidency, and his son, at a time when the White House had suspended military aid to Ukraine.“I would have no choice but to take it up,” McConnell said during an appearance on CNBC, before quickly adding: “How long you’re on it is a whole different matter.”

In his latest tweets Monday, Trump also took fresh aim at the Bidens and the media, calling both “corrupt.”

Trump targeted Schiff for remarks at a hearing last week in which Schiff embellished what was said in the call between Trump and Zelensky.In another tweet, Trump complained that other countries have not provided enough military aid to Ukraine, asking “why is it always the USA that does so much and puts up so much money for Ukraine and other countries?”

Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.Trump also attacked the media on Monday for what he considers inadequate coverage of the Bidens’ actions in Ukraine.“In actuality, the Media may be even more Corrupt than the Bidens, which is hard to do!”

On Monday, Trump tweeted that the whistleblower’s complaint — which revealed Trump had pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — was “not holding up.” He also said he was “trying to find out” about the whistleblower’s identity.Think about that when you read the announcement that Vice President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, has accepted a position on the board at Ukraine's largest private gas firm.AD

Here's a small selection of the responses to the news, which ranged from the incredulous to the resigned:

Biden's son takes job a Ukraine gas firm.http://t.co/QzJQdoysp4 — Robert Coalson (@CoalsonR) May 13, 2014

Joe Biden's son is now head of legal affairs at Ukraine's largest gas company.Biden’s son to head Ukrainian gas company.“Hunter Biden is a private citizen and a lawyer," White House spokesperson Kendra Barkoff told The Post.AD

It's true that there are no rules against Hunter Biden taking this position.There was speculation from Ukrainian energy analysts that Biden's appointment may have been an attempt to avoid sanctions by other, bigger Yanukovych allies.It's also unclear why, exactly, Biden was hired: At Yahoo News, Olivier Knox and Meredith Shiner have speculated that the fact that so much of Burisma's permits are in Ukraine's troubled Dnieper-Donets Basin may play a role.No matter how qualified Biden is, it ties into the idea that U.S. foreign policy is self-interested, and that's a narrative Vladimir Putin has pushed during Ukraine's crisis with references to Iraq and Libya.AD

To be fair, Hunter Biden isn't the only person linked to politics on the board of Burisma: The Wall Street Journal reports that Devon Archer, the college roommate of John Kerry's stepson, has also joined, and on Wednesday, Ukrainian media reported that former Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski would also join the board.And Biden is certainly not the first politically-linked person to get a dubiously high-paying job on a board.“Trump was pressing Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden because he cares so deeply about fighting corruption.” Faced with a rough transcript provided by the White House in which President Trump explicitly asks the president of Ukraine to investigate a potential 2020 opponent, Republicans have argued that Trump’s interest was not in Biden per se, but in the issue of corruption more broadly.“Can I interest you in a plateful of lies?” Republicans, including Trump, have insisted that the real story is that when he was vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating the company on whose board his son Hunter sat.These cases are tenuous, at best

Trump pushed for two specific investigations in his July 25 call with Zelensky — one involving CrowdStrike and the other involving former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.As for the Bidens’ case, then-Vice President Biden pushed for the removal of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, who had been investigating an energy company that employed Hunter Biden.But as U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said, the investigation was dormant when Biden applied the pressure.And even when the investigation was underway, it hadn’t been scrutinizing the Bidens.AD

The CrowdStrike thing appears to be a Trump hobby horse aimed at questioning the origins of the Russia inquiry, while the Bidens thing is clearly intended to damage the Democratic candidate who polls the best against Trump in 2020.The two, said Wallace, were working with Giuliani “off the books apart from the administration” and that only President Trump knew about the operation — tidbits that were attributed to a “top U.S. official.”

AD

AD

The official Twitter account of “Fox News Sunday” advertised the development:

Breaking news on FOX News Sunday: Chris reports Rudy Giuliani did not act alone in trying to get dirt from Ukraine on Joe Biden... and much more.The information, says Wallace, was “totally different” and in a “totally different context.”

After summing up Vogel’s May story, Wallace riffed, “Is that the same as saying as reporting now that Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing have been part of Rudy Giuliani’s effort to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and quoting a top U.S. official that their efforts were off the books and nobody knew about them except the president of the United States?Should he be out there publicly calling for the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden?I think nobody’s asking about Joe Biden calling for the guy to be prosecuted — fired who’s looking into a board that his son ...

Then there’s former Trump homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, who effectively told ABC News’s “This Week” on Sunday that Giuliani was giving Trump bad advice.“The strategic decision Kim Jong Un has made is to do whatever he can to keep nuclear weapons capability and development.”

His remarks came as the White House lashed out at the deepening House probe of Trump’s call with Ukranian President Volodymr Zelensky in July, during which Trump asked him to conduct an investigation into presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden.Trump and his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have extensively pressured the Ukrainian president not just to fabricate smears of Joe Biden, a potential general-election opponent, but also to validate a flatly debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind the 2016 email hacks, and created the impression that Russia had worked to elect Trump.The server, they say Ukraine has it.”

Amid the inquiry into Trump’s request that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the president has increasingly accused his perceived enemies — from Democratic leaders to the anonymous whistleblower who sparked the probe — of treason.Joe Biden is the kind of mainstream, professional politician the Chinese are used to dealing with.In 2011, a year before Xi’s elevation to head of the Communist Party, Biden traveled to China for extensive talks as part of an effort by the Obama administration to understand the incoming Chinese leader.The “Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence,” which have ostensibly guided Chinese foreign policy since the early 1950s, include a stricture against meddling in other countries’ “internal affairs.” State media outlets have maintained a near-blackout, imposed by the propaganda authorities, on Trump’s request to investigate Hunter Biden’s involvement in a local investment fund, another sign that Beijing wants nothing to do with the American president’s antics.Every day — every few hours, seemingly — more evidence is uncovered revealing that President Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president,” Biden wrote.“He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal political interests instead of the national interest.”

AD

“He does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States,” Biden continued.“He sees only the power — and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump.”

AD

Biden’s move came amid growing anxiety among Biden’s supporters that he is unprepared to handle the dual challenges of running a general-election campaign against Trump while simultaneously facing an intensifying Democratic primary contest.Biden’s supporters also have bridled that Democrats have been slow to rush to Biden’s defense.AD

Biden’s campaign on Saturday night distributed a memo to reporters from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield.The subject of the memo highlighted the twin challenges that one of the leading candidates has faced: “Biden Campaign Will Hammer Donald Trump While Focusing On The Issues.”

AD

“This campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people’s lives while simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden,” Bedingfield wrote.AD

Biden and his campaign have struggled over the past two weeks amid a flurry of developments that have launched a House impeachment inquiry in which Biden is a central player.Biden has alternated between pushing back on Trump and seeming unsure of how to handle a situation that has placed the focus on his son Hunter.Biden on Thursday night in San Francisco talked about the allegations, then quickly shifted to say, “This isn’t about me, it’s about you.” His focus then turned back toward himself, as he noted how he was the one who defeated Trump in most polls.AD

He then went on to talk about his son, making light of a false allegation by Trump that Hunter Biden had made $1.5 billion in China.“I wonder where the hell that money is, man, because I’ve got to pay tuitions,” Biden said.After devoting several minutes to that, he said, “I don’t want to get sucked into this, what he likes to do.”

AD

Biden’s Post op-ed attempted to focus both on Trump’s latest attacks, as well as a broader indictment of his presidency.AD

“Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie,” Biden wrote.That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.”

Biden has bet that voters are familiar with his long tenure in public life, which he hopes will make him more resilient to Trump’s attacks than earlier presidential targets.It showed that Pillsbury had sent the journalist an email reading: “Actually I got a quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese.”

AD

AD

Pillsbury, 74, gave The Washington Post an even different explanation later on Thursday.Pillsbury claimed he was told that money from the Bank of China went to Hunter Biden’s firm but that it was difficult to determine exactly how much.He said the Chinese were largely reticent to speak about Biden.Pillsbury said he spoke with Trump just before he went on his trip to China last month, but he said the president didn’t ask him to raise Biden to Chinese officials.The China expert said he’d never spoken with Trump about Hunter Biden but was aware of the president calling for the Chinese to investigate from the South Lawn of the White House last week.The president has said without offering any evidence that the younger Biden received $1.5 billion from the Chinese government as a “payoff” to curry favor with the then-vice president.AD

AD

Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said Pillsbury’s comments are the latest example of a Trump associate “seeking dirt with which to smear the Biden family” in a foreign country.“While the president’s limited number of vocal defenders have tried claiming that his South Lawn statement asking China to investigate the Biden family somehow wasn’t a ‘real’ request, Pillsbury’s admission again lays bare that there is no depth to which Trump will not sink to avoid facing Joe Biden in next year’s election,” Bates said.No evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of either Biden has been made public.Trump once called him “probably the leading authority on China.”

After declining to say during a separate appearance on Fox Business whether he had raised the subject of Hunter Biden with the Chinese at the president’s request, Pillsbury told C-SPAN that he was not acting on White House orders.Although the texts do not mention Biden by name, congressional Democrats leading an impeachment inquiry are pointing to them as clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing “to launch politically motivated investigations,” top Democrats said in statement Thursday night.Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, sat on the board of Burisma for five years.House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) told reporters Thursday that Volker had provided “ample evidence” to show that it was a “requirement” that Zelensky launch the 2016 elections investigation to “exonerate Russia’s role,” and that the focus on Burisma was to investigate Biden.Volker is the first of several State Department officials expected to give congressional investigators an inside account of the Trump administration’s efforts to press for a Ukrainian investigation of Biden, who, as a leading 2020 Democratic candidate to challenge Trump for the White House, has become a fixed target of the president’s attacks.At the heart of Trump’s effort is the contention of his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, that as vice president, Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine’s then-prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, as part of a corrupt plot to halt investigations of Burisma.AD

Volker told House investigators on Thursday that he had warned Giuliani against trusting the information he was receiving from Ukrainian political figures about Joe Biden and his son.AD

Joe Biden and his defenders have denied Giuliani’s accusations and noted that Biden’s push to remove Shokin, Ukraine’s former prosecutor general, was part of a broader international effort that included the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, where leaders viewed Shokin as inept.The first rejected ad, posted last week to YouTube, suggests the president is being unfairly scrutinized for pressing Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.AD

AD

The 30-second commercial claims Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor looking into “his son’s company.” Hunter Biden sat on the board of energy firm Burisma but does not own it, and while Biden was key in the Obama administration’s efforts to remove Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin by using U.S. aid as leverage, no evidence indicates Biden sought to help his son.CNN said in a statement that “in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.”

AD

AD

Murtaugh maintained the Biden ad is accurate and was “reviewed by counsel.”

Another 30-second video titled “Coup” and released Wednesday has been rejected as well, CNN said Thursday.At that time — following Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelenksy — the Ukrainians probably understood action on corruption to include the investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.AD

AD

Officials close to Pence insist that he was unaware of Trump’s efforts to press Zelensky for damaging information about Biden and his son, who had served on the board of an obscure Ukrainian gas company, when his father was overseeing U.S. policy on Ukraine.Pence did not mention Biden or the dormant probe of Burisma, the company for which his son had served as a board member.In the call, Trump asked for a “favor” and urged Zelensky to cooperate with Attorney General William P. Barr to look for compromising information about Hunter Biden.Without evidence, Trump alleged that Joe Biden used his influence as vice president in 2016 to kill an investigation into the gas company and his son.In a letter sent to New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, Biden’s campaign called Schweizer a “discredited right-wing polemicist” and suggested the op-ed was part of a larger pattern of “journalistic malpractice.”

“Are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, wrote in the Wednesday letter, which was posted by CNN’s Oliver Darcy.“Our coverage of the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden has been fair and accurate,” a spokesperson said, adding that the paper “will continue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race.”

Schweizer didn’t immediately respond to messages sent to his spokesperson and to Breitbart News, where he is a senior contributor.Biden’s complaint to the Times comes amid a larger push against what his campaign argues is rampant misinformation.Earlier on Wednesday, Facebook rejected a plea from Biden to take down a 30-second Trump campaign ad that CNN refused to air because it made false claims about the former vice president.Biden made a similar request to Twitter, which has yet to respond.AD

AD

Trump’s near-daily attempts to tie Biden to corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China are at the center of that battle — and both allegations have roots in Schweizer’s work.Schweizer’s 2018 book is also the source of repeated claims by Trump that Hunter Biden made $1.5 billion in corrupt dealings with China, which The Washington Post’s Fact Checker called “false.”

AD

AD

The Times op-ed on Wednesday, which identifies Schweizer as “an investigative journalist,” ran under the headline “What Hunter Biden Did Was Legal — And That’s the Problem.” He argues that the vice president’s son used his father’s influence to make money in Ukraine and China, and that Washington should pass tougher financial disclosure laws for politicians’ relatives.In his letter to the Times, Biden’s campaign complains that the piece makes “more malicious claims about the Biden family.”

“Despite voluminous work done by the independent press and fact-checkers — including some by The Times — to refute the heinous conspiracy theory that Donald Trump attempted to bully Ukraine into propping-up for him, the paper ran an op-ed by none other than Peter Schweizer, making more malicious claims about the Biden family,” Bedingfield wrote in the letter.Again and again, they make clear that Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, would not get military aid or the Oval Office invitation he coveted until he committed to investigations that Trump hoped would deliver damaging information on former vice president Joe Biden and undermine the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.“A lot of it started with Ukraine,” Trump said at a point in the conversation where he also alluded to aid and arms promised to Ukraine while telling Zelensky, “I would like you to do us a favor.” Among other things, Trump explicitly asked Zelensky to initiate an investigation of Biden and his son.Texts show the extent to which they explicitly pursued a transaction tying U.S. military aid and a future visit to the White House to a hard commitment from Ukraine to revive a corruption probe of a company, Burisma, that had employed Hunter Biden, the vice president’s son, as a board member making between $50,000 and $100,000 a month, according to people familiar with the matter.He didn’t cite Burisma or Biden by name, but the implication of his words struck others in the room as troubling and obvious, particularly given Giuliani’s public comments.When the two diplomats sent the statement to Giuliani, he was dismayed that it wasn’t more specific, and according to Volker, he demanded that the Ukrainians insert specific references to the 2016 election and Burisma, the gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board.At the time, the officials were unnerved by the removal in May of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, by subsequent efforts by Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to promote Ukraine-related conspiracies, as well as by signals in meetings at the White House that Trump wanted the new government in Kiev to deliver material that might be politically damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.AD

NSC officials were alternately baffled and alarmed by the behavior of Giuliani, who had agitated for Yovanovitch’s removal and proceeded to declare on cable television interviews that he was pressing Ukraine to reopen a corruption probe of an energy company that had paid Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, as much as $100,000 a month to serve as a board member.AD

Biden has been criticized for taking that position while his father was vice president and involved in Ukraine policy.But the younger Biden has never been accused of wrongdoing in his role as a board member for the company, Burisma, and there is no evidence to support the contentions by Giuliani and others that Joe Biden intervened inappropriately.Senior officials understood Sondland’s statement to be a reference to Burisma and Biden.Sanders aides have pointed to his strong fundraising as a sign of enthusiasm for his candidacy, even as he sits in third place in many polls behind Biden and Warren.Biden has been pulled into the impeachment debate.That is, it may turn out to be a clear conspiracy against Biden.”

Kolomoisky owned the television station that distributed the comedy show in which Zelensky played the role of the president of Ukraine.They allegedly struck a deal with [Prosecutor-general Yuriy] Lutsenko about the fate of this criminal case – Burisma, [former vice president] Biden, meddling in the U.S. election and so on.”

AD

AD

Kolomoisky is no innocent.Kolomoisky, in his May interview, claimed to have lots of evidence about Giuliani’s efforts with Parnas and Fruman to dig up dirt on Biden and get various Ukrainian officials to help.“If we put aside conspiracy theories and some comedy staff, the situation was about their willingness to make both Lutsenko and Zelensky interested in continuing the investigation (into Biden),” he said..”

AD

Lutsenko has recently said he found no evidence the Bidens committed any wrongdoing.Giuliani turned on Lutsenko this week, after working with him for months to push the Biden narrative.But regardless of whether you believe this Ukrainian oligarch, Giuliani’s meddling in Ukrainian politics and interference in U.S. foreign policy to advance the Biden accusations was extensive, public and predated the involvement of the State Department, Volker or the whistleblower.AD

Much of this is a result of the continued debate performances by former vice president Joe Biden.But the sum of Biden on the stage against his rivals has been underwhelming at best, disappointing to those who see him as the most capable of winning a general election.AD

Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg are four of the 18 candidates still in the race.Can Biden step up and show something more than he has?The Sept. 9 exchange between Sondland and the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine has become central to the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into whether the president abused his office in pressuring Ukraine to open an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and his son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.AD

Sondland appears poised to say that he and other diplomats did not know that the request to mention Burisma was really an effort to impugn the reputations of Biden and his son Hunter, who had served as a Burisma board member.Sondland contends that he didn’t know about the Biden connection until a whistleblower complaint and transcript surfaced in late September.AD

To trust Sondland’s testimony, members of Congress will have to believe Sondland had not seen televised appearances by Giuliani over the spring and summer, or numerous newspaper and magazine articles questioning whether Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma could prove to be a drag on his father’s presidential campaign.The person said Sondland was never briefed about Biden being part of the issue and was not aware of it until the transcript of the phone call was released.Sondland “somehow wants all of us to believe that he is ‘shocked, shocked’ that anything he was wrapped up in was aimed at the Bidens.At least two GOP senators and one former administration official expressed uneasiness with Trump’s efforts to encourage foreign governments to investigate former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.And documents reviewed by The Washington Post showed that Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, defended Biden in a statement to Congress that directly undercut Trump’s claims of corruption by the former vice president.“Given the scope, it does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the Do Nothing Democrats to call attention to their partisan impeachment.”

Democrats are investigating whether Trump or others in his administration linked the release of the aid to the president’s request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter.AD

During a July phone call with Zelensky, Trump pushed for Ukrainian prosecutors to work with Attorney General William P. Barr and Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani on an investigation of alleged corruption by the Bidens.AD

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.After the president said Thursday that China should also investigate Biden, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said it was “wrong and appalling.”

“When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,” Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement Friday.), who is up for reelection next year, distanced himself from Trump’s call for a Chinese investigation targeting Biden.Trump has since linked those corruption allegations to Biden, calling for an investigation.But that’s it, and that’s why we held up the money.”

Mulvaney denied that the aid was also contingent on a Ukrainian investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, or Biden’s son Hunter, another potential quid pro quo that congressional Democrats are looking into as part of the impeachment inquiry.“We have a confession from the president,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, referring to Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pressured his counterpart to open investigations into the 2016 election and the Bidens.AD

“I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President’s 2020 reelection campaign,” he said, explaining that he understood that Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm that employed Hunter Biden, was “one of many examples of Ukrainian companies run by oligarchs and lacking the type of corporate governance structures found in Western companies.”

AD

Sondland’s apparent failure to connect the dots between Burisma and the Bidens occurred as Giuliani made several televised appearances over the spring and summer criticizing Hunter Biden’s involvement on the board, and numerous newspaper and magazine articles questioned whether his role at Burisma could prove to be a drag on his father’s presidential campaign.This is a fraud against the American people!”

AD

Earlier this past week, he tweeted, “The Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!”

Trump’s critique came even though the president himself admitted nearly two weeks ago that he did indeed discuss former vice president Joe Biden, a political rival, with the Ukrainian president.AD

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters then.Among them: that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former vice president Biden and his son, and that the only specific instance of alleged corruption that Trump referenced on the call was the one pertaining to Biden.AD

Giuliani has acknowledged that he conveyed Trump’s desire for Ukraine to investigate Biden to Ukrainian officials close to Zelensky.“Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,” Yermak wrote, making a reference to the Ukrainian gas company whose board included Hunter Biden.Last month, the White House released a rough transcript of a July 25 call in which Trump asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a time when U.S. military aid was being withheld from the country.The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, and Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden, who sat on its board.Hunter Biden served on Burisma’s board for five years; Joe Biden is currently making a White House bid.That order came the same week Hill resigned from the National Security Council; it also took place one week before Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone, when he appeared to pressure Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Parnas and Fruman, who had been helping Giuliani investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, were arrested a week ago at Dulles International Airport, outside of Washington, where they had one-way tickets on a flight out of the country, officials said.Federal prosecutors say that the company was a front used to disguise the funds’ true source and that the money came from “a private lending transaction between Fruman and third parties.”

Giuliani has also said Parnas and Fruman have been assisting Giuliani in his efforts to get Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son, as well as Giuliani’s claim that Democrats conspired with Ukrainians in the 2016 U.S. election.Since late 2018, the two Florida-based business executives have been assisting Giuliani’s push to get Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son, as well as Giuliani’s claim that Democrats conspired with Ukrainians in the 2016 campaign.In May 2018, about six months before the men began working with Giuliani on his Biden investigation, a Florida business established by Parnas received a $1.26 million wire transfer from an account whose owner was represented by a real estate lawyer who specializes in assisting foreign buyers of U.S. property, court documents and corporate filings show.Giuliani has figured prominently in a campaign to pressure Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to take actions that would undermine Biden, a potential political rival of Trump in 2020.Those include Trump’s effort, revealed by a whistleblower in a complaint made public last month, in a July phone call to cajole Zelensky into reopening a dormant investigation into a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, that Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, once sat on the board of.AD

Shokin has aided Giuliani’s effort, alleging in an affidavit last month that the reason he was removed as prosecutor general — and the reason Biden wanted him gone — was that he was investigating Burisma for corruption.After the most recent Democratic debate, Biden was criticized by some prominent African Americans for his answer to a question about how to repair the legacy of slavery in the United States.Biden’s harshest critics suggested that his rambling response telling black parents to make sure they kept the record player on at night was “the kind of paternalistic racism that has so long existed in both liberal and conservative circles.”

This certainly isn’t the first time the former vice president has been attacked for his racial rhetoric.Biden has a long history of racially insensitive statements and came under fire this year for praising the “civility” of segregationist senators he served with in the 1970s.AD

AD

Nevertheless, Biden’s strong African American support kept him atop the Democratic presidential field throughout the summer.When data is averaged across seven weekly Economist/YouGov Polls from August and September, we find that 41 percent of African American Democratic primary voters selected Joe Biden as their first choice, compared with just 19 percent of whites.The Obama effect on public opinion

Biden’s popularity with African American voters is undoubtedly due in part to his service as Barack Obama’s loyal vice president.AD

Public opinion about Biden repeats that pattern.They did with opinions about Biden.The figure below shows that Biden was also significantly more popular with African Americans than his Democratic predecessors, Walter Mondale and Al Gore, were during their vice presidencies.Biden was rated 11 degrees warmer than Gore and 20 degrees warmer than Mondale on the American National Election Studies’s (ANES) 0-100 thermometer rating.The ongoing Obama effect on black support for Biden

The Obama effect has continued to help Biden with African American voters.The figure below shows support for Biden among black and white Democratic primary voters in July and August, based on how favorably they rated President Obama.Those results, which come from weekly surveys conducted in July and August by UCLA political scientists Chris Tausanovitch and Lynn Vavreck in partnership with the marketing research firm Lucid, show that Biden performed best this summer among black and white Democratic voters who rate Obama very favorably.Yet the Obama effect on support for Biden is significantly stronger for African Americans than it is for whites.AD

In fact, the figure above suggests that Biden does better among black voters than white voters primarily because of the Obama effect.The left side of the display shows that Biden’s support is nearly identical among black and white Democratic voters who did not rate Obama very favorably.But on the right side, you’ll see Biden performs about 10 percentage points better with African Americans who have very favorable opinions of Obama than with whites who rated Obama very favorably.So Biden’s close connection to Obama has helped him with black voters.Biden’s racial controversies could make it increasingly difficult for black political leaders to offer such informed endorsements — especially in a crowded primary field where most of Biden’s Democratic rivals have positioned themselves to the left of the former vice president on racial justice issues.Prior research suggests those same voters would be least likely to support a Democratic candidate like Biden who takes tepid positions on race.AD

AD

In fact, there’s already some evidence that Biden’s black support is declining.In two large UCLA/Lucid surveys conducted in early September, African American support for Biden decreased by 10 percentage points from where it was earlier in the summer (45 percent to 35 percent).So if Joe Biden doesn’t do more to show black voters that he will represent their interests, then he certainly shouldn’t take the black vote for granted simply because of his close connection to Barack Obama.When Johnson instead launched into an obfuscating attack on the news media — and floated President Trump’s fact-averse talking points about Biden — Todd pushed back hard.AD

What you did see, instead, on many of the Sunday shows, were Trump’s TV ads, where his false “Biden is corrupt and so is the news media” message could go unchallenged.Last week, Democrat Joseph Biden asked Facebook to remove a Trump campaign ad that made false claims, prompting the company to refuse on the grounds that political speech is not covered by the expansive fact-checking system it put in place after the 2016 presidential election.AD

AD

The potential for abuse became clear Monday after Biden pressed Facebook to remove an ad based on demonstrable falsehoods.The ad claimed that Biden had used the threat of withholding $1 billion to Ukraine to quash an investigation of a company for which his son was a board member — even though the claim has been repeatedly labeled as untrue by news organizations.“Our approach is grounded in Facebook’s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,” Katie Harbath, the public policy director for Global Elections at Facebook and a former digital strategist for Republican political committees and the 2008 presidential campaign of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, wrote to Biden campaign officials.In doing so, Facebook found itself in the company of other social media sites, including Twitter, where the Trump campaign also ran its anti-Biden ad.Trump’s campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh defended the ads as “100 percent accurate” and said, “The truth hurts and it’s not a surprise that Biden doesn’t want anyone to hear it.”

The claim is false: Biden’s move did not imperil the investigation, was backed by the State Department and was coordinated with leaders of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund due to concerns the prosecutor general ignored corruption, fact-checkers have stated.AD

Over the last two weeks, the Trump campaign has spent huge sums on Facebook ads, the data show, including $45,000 related to Biden; $252,000 related to socialism; $104,000 related to Mueller; and $86,000 related to “fake news.” Trump’s campaign spent more on Facebook ads last week related to the debates than any of the Democrats actually participating in them.I examined these networks’ reporting by searching YouTube for their postings with phrases “Trump, Biden, Ukraine” and “Trump, Biden, Zelenskiy” in Russian and examining all such posts in the top 25 results for each search.That particular NTV report started with the announcement that the Democrats were accusing Trump of putting pressure on Ukraine’s president “so as to allegedly remove from the race his likely contender in the forthcoming presidential elections, Joe Biden.” It then showed photos of Biden and his son taken in Ukraine, arguing that Trump had good reason to ask to have them investigated.A studio analyst then showed that Trump was 10 percent behind Biden in recent polls, with a Russian academic saying Biden could beat Trump in 2020.NTV then alleged that in 2015, Biden threatened to withhold economic assistance from Ukraine unless then-President Petro Poroshenko quashed the corruption investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company for which Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of directors.After alleging that an anonymous U.S. intelligence officer said Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, the Channel One reporter added, “But the source failed to mention that such an investigation had been underway in Ukraine in years past, until Joe Biden replaced Ukraine’s prosecutor general — something he proudly remembered last year.” This line of reporting also intimated that U.S. pressure prompts the Ukrainian government to undermine its own principles of truth and justice.Theme 2: Democracy is just a cover for corruption

Both channels repeatedly referred to selfish political interests driving both Trump and Biden in their dealings with Ukraine — and often mentioned their different party affiliations.AD

AD

Another NTV report on Sept. 26 quoted Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) characterizing Trump’s demands that Zelenskiy investigate Biden as a “mafia raid” (mafioznyi naezd).But all the above-mentioned NTV and Channel One reports portrayed Biden’s alleged pressure on Ukraine as being the same kind of raid, if not worse.Theme 3: Biden’s actions are the biggest scandal

While summarizing allegations against Trump, Russian TV presented Biden’s actions as the central issue.In all the reports I observed, journalists focused on evidence implicating Joe Biden in malfeasance for pushing Ukraine to get rid of its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who was allegedly investigating Burisma.A regular viewer of Russian TV could very well assume that the Trump allegations are a sequel to Russian TV’s coverage since May of what Channel One has called the “Biden scandal” and “Biden family cabal operation” (semeynyi podryad).The first of those reports includes Hunter Biden hugging his father with a CNN chyron in English that reads “Navy Kicks Out Biden’s Son Over Cocaine Test.” A voice-over translates into Russian.House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry just over two weeks ago, focusing on Trump’s pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.They might do it again — and profit off of it.”

This month, Facebook declined to take down an ad from Trump’s campaign that contained falsehoods about former vice president Joe Biden, prompting widespread criticism from the party.Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign, which had requested its removal, similarly expressed outrage with Zuckerberg after his Georgetown speech.Biden spokesman Bill Russo said in a statement that the Facebook leader cloaked company policy “in a feigned concern for free expression.”

Zuckerberg’s remarks Thursday were a rare, public attempt to explain his vision of free expression in the digital age.It started about two weeks ago, after disclosure of Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukrainian government officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 campaign rival, and Biden’s son Hunter Biden.Trump has denied that he withheld diplomatic engagement and military assistance to Ukraine in order to pressure the country into investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company.AD

The testimony of McKinley, who occupied the seventh-floor office next to Pompeo, could do more to clarify for lawmakers persistent questions about the secretary’s role in the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden and the abrupt removal of Yovanovitch in the spring.Ahead of her ouster, the president’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani waged a campaign against Yovanovitch, accusing her of trying to protect Biden and his son from a Ukrainian investigation and harboring an improper loyalty to liberal billionaire George Soros.Trump also again insisted that his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “PERFECT,” dismissing concerns at the core of the whistleblower’s complaint that Trump pressed for an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son.●The Ukraine story appears to be hurting Trump — and possibly Biden, too.8:45 p.m.: Giuliani continues to get blowback from some Republicans

The Ukraine story has spurred Democrats to announce a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and with those developments has come a noted rise in support for impeaching Trump.And importantly, a plurality seems to be internalizing Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani’s dubious claims of potential wrongdoing by Joe Biden.8:35 a.m.: Giuliani seeks to put focus on Hunter Biden’s business dealings

Giuliani sought Monday to focus attention on the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden, complaining that the media has not adequately covered the latter’s business dealings in Ukraine and China.“How corrupted is most of our media if they can’t figure out that Ukraine and China was paying for Biden’s office, not his struggling son’s nonexistent expertise,” Giuliani said.“Every time we lecture them on corruption, they laugh and say you’re no different.”

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Joe Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.Hunter Biden also traveled with his father on Air Force Two to China during his tenure as vice president.Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities.As a result, respondents were probably aware of Biden’s entanglement in the Trump-Ukraine drama but didn’t know about Sanders’s heart attack, which was revealed after the poll ended.AD

AD

Biden, meanwhile, continues to hold a lead among moderate and conservative Democrats, with 28 percent.Among those who prefer politicians to stick to their positions, Sanders is the top choice (26 percent), with Biden at 20 percent and Warren at 18.On the other hand, the numbers don’t look as good for Sanders and Biden.At the same time, Warren has work to do to win over voters who aren’t currently backing one of the other top-polling candidates (Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and Harris).Seventy-two percent of Democrats say they have a favorable impression of her, trailing Sanders (79 percent) and slightly better than Biden (69 percent).And the shift of the men’s vote may have come at Biden’s expense.Although Thomson-DeVeaux’s analysis found Biden polling roughly equally with men and women, in our survey he is at 22 percent among women but just 15 percent among men.The whistleblower’s complaint centered on Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volo­dymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressed the new leader to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.Trump has repeatedly denied that there was a “quid pro quo” between the military assistance and the request to investigate the Bidens.AD

The consternation started when former judge Andrew Napolitano, a Fox pundit who has turned on Trump in recent months, told Fox chief news anchor Shepard Smith on-air that Trump’s call to Ukraine’s president, during which he pressured him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, was a “crime.” Later the same day, Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has a warm relationship with Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch, invited DiGenova onto his show.“At a moment when he needs his staunch Republican allies, for him to do something that causes many of his staunchest allies to break with him, then that’s very significant.”

AD

So it was notable when Carlson and Neil Patel wrote in a Daily Caller opinion piece that “Trump should not have been on the phone with a foreign head of state encouraging another country to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden,” and that “there’s no way to spin this.” But the column quickly turned to conclude that while bad, Trump’s actions weren’t impeachable, an argument that CNN White House correspondent Abby Phillip tweeted was a road map for conservatives looking for a way to condemn Trump’s call to the Ukraine but avoid impeachment.Democrats have taken particular issue with Facebook’s decision to allow an ad from President Trump’s 2020 campaign that included falsehoods about former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.The Trump campaign ad about the Bidens made claims about their connections to Ukraine, a critical element in the congressional impeachment inquiry.Biden’s campaign asked Facebook to remove the ad, describing it as false, but the social network declined, pointing to a policy against fact-checking such political speech.AD

Speaking at Georgetown later Thursday, Zuckerberg acknowledged the company once considered prohibiting political ads but decided against it, believing it “favors incumbents and whoever the media covers.”

But a spokesman for Biden’s campaign, Bill Russo, later assailed Zuckerberg for an unconvincing rationale.Giuliani has found himself at the center of the expanding investigation into Trump’s request that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky probe former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.The former New York mayor singled out Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading the probe as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and was one of three committee chairs on Monday to demand that Giuliani hand over all records concerning Ukraine and the Biden family.Three congressional committees are now probing how Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, as well as a debunked theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election in an attempt to damage Trump’s candidacy.The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, the energy company, and Biden — something that made Bolton go “ballistic” after the meeting, the official said.AD

Lawmakers also expect to hear testimony from other witnesses, including on Tuesday from George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, whom Giuliani and conservative media figures have accused of trying to protect the Bidens from an investigation and of working at the behest of billionaire George Soros, whose Open Society Foundation has funded anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.During their conversation, Trump asked Zelensky to do him a “favor” by investigating Biden and the claim of Ukrainian interference in the U.S. election, according to a memorandum documenting the call that was released last month by the White House.According to the transcript, he told Zelensky he wanted the new leader to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, his son Hunter and the origins of the Russia investigation.AD

AD

In explaining her departure, she acknowledged months of criticisms from Giuliani, who had accused her of privately badmouthing the president and seeking to protect the interests of former vice president Joe Biden and his son who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.Volker’s text messages pertain to the weeks before and after a July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, in which the American president asked his Ukrainian counterpart to look into the purported involvement of Ukrainians in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the role that Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden played on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma.AD

AD

Those messages revealed an apparent effort to encourage the Ukrainians to investigate the 2016 U.S. election, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and Biden’s son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.The president’s son Donald Trump Jr. referred to her on Twitter as a “joker.” And the president himself suggested she was biased against him, telling Zelensky she was “bad news,” according to a White House summary of their July 25 phone call in which Trump sought to enlist Zelensky’s help looking into the Bidens.AD

Earlier this year, conservative media outlets attacked Yovanovitch and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, accusing them of trying to protect the Bidens from an investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors.Accusations that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate his political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, are at the center of a whistleblower complaint that has prompted Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry.On the call, Trump repeatedly pressed Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.But revelations about Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart — and pressure the president applied for him to probe former vice president Joe Biden— reset the fall agenda.CNET

They tried to do the same thing with Joe Biden and the Ukraine story, pushing a conspiracy theory that, though wrong in most ways, was bought by the conspiracy theorist in chief, the result being that he’s now likely to be impeached.Earlier this month, Facebook declined a request from former vice president Joe Biden’s campaign to take down a Trump ad that included a debunked claim about his family’s involvement with a Ukrainian gas company.One Russian account, which portrayed itself as a black voter in Michigan, used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to hammer Biden for gaffes about racial issues.The Biden campaign applauded Facebook for disabling the fake accounts but said Trump’s penchant for falsehoods posed just as great a challenge for the company, which has refused to fact-check political advertising placed by the president’s reelection campaign.AD

Her campaign’s Facebook ad appeared to refer to the controversy surrounding a Trump campaign spot titled “Corruption,” which made false assertions about former vice president Joe Biden and claimed without evidence that the 2020 Democratic presidential contender offered $1 billion to Ukraine to help his son Hunter Biden.The ad ran as the president finds himself engulfed in scandal, after a whistleblower revealed that Trump appeared to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.In a written response to the Biden campaign’s complaints, Katie Harbath, the platform’s public policy director for global elections, said that the company allowed such ads to stand because “our approach is grounded in Facebook’s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.”

On Saturday, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone referred The Washington Post to Clegg’s and Harbath’s previous statements.If the Trump campaign can claim that Joe Biden tried to give a billion-dollar bribe to Ukraine, then his potential opponents may be left to wonder: What else are they going to try?For former vice president Joe Biden, this was always a looming iceberg.had taken a within-the-margin-of-error lead over Biden in national polling.At that point, Biden had an 11-point lead in support (shown on the vertical axis below) but a 37-point lead on the electability question (left to right).Biden had more support on electability in August (49 percent) than overall (32 percent), so his dot is below the diagonal line.Biden, meanwhile, has seen his overall support sink — but he has also maintained about the same level of electability.Biden is hanging in there, though, still viewed as having the best chance against Trump by twice as many respondents in Quinnipiac’s poll.But the implication is that the dominant existing calculus — Biden is most electable and, therefore, has the best shot — isn’t as solid as might have been expected.We said this in July and will say it again: Biden’s 2020 may look more like Hillary Clinton’s 2008 than her 2016.That’s a fairly direct indictment of the caution offered by Buttigieg — and Joe Biden, whose agenda is somewhat more liberal than is commonly acknowledged, but who nonetheless is making his No.And Giuliani apparently made clear what was expected: "Sondland plans to say that over the following weeks, he and Volker, along with the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor, learned that as a condition of such a meeting, Giuliani was demanding that Zelensky’s administration publicly announce it would tackle corruption , including singling out as a target Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company linked to Biden’s son.""Sondland plans to say that over the following weeks, he and Volker, along with the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B.

Joe Biden: "I've got to be more aggressive," he told donors last week.But Biden has shifted in the last few days, the New York Times's Katie Glueck and Alexander Burns report.Hunter speaks: For the first time since Trump began his attacks, Hunter Biden will speak publicly this morning.Hunter Biden resigned from his board seat on a Chinese company over the weekend and pledged to not conduct any foreign business should his father win the presidency.In the CBS News-YouGov poll released on Sunday, Warren and Biden are tied in Iowa at 22 percent, statistically tied with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who is at 21 percent.A warning to Biden, however: 51 percent are “somewhat satisfied” with Biden’s response to Trump’s attacks, while only 23 percent are “very satisfied.”

In New Hampshire, the same poll has Warren at 32 percent, Biden at 24, Sanders at 17 and Buttigieg at 7.There, too, Biden does better on electability and ability to keep Americans safe.Finally, she faces the nagging concern as to whether she is too far left to prevail in the general election, although Sanders handed her a gift in declaring, “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones.”

As polls show, her margin over Trump in the general election about equals Biden’s; “electability” concerns may fade.And unlike the party's race for president, where Joe Biden has been out-fundraised by a number of opponents, Hickenlooper came into the race with a money advantage, long ties with labor unions and the clear support of the national party.No — 60%

The Democratic National Committee is raising the bar for who qualifies for the Nov. 20 debate, above the polling averages of a number of candidates here.Neither of those foreign leaders specifically encouraged Trump to see Ukraine as a potential source of damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, nor did they describe Kyiv as complicit in an unsubstantiated 2016 election conspiracy theory, officials said.AD

U.S. officials emphasized that while Putin and Orban denigrated Ukraine, Trump’s decision to seek damaging material on Biden was more directly driven by Trump’s own impulses and Kyiv conspiracy theories promoted by his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.AD

There is no evidence that Putin spoke about Biden or endorsed Giuliani’s unsubstantiated claims that it was Ukraine — and not Russia — that had interfered in the 2016 election.I don’t pretend to know which it is, but considering Giuliani has said so many wild, incriminating and demonstrably false things in TV interviews and publicly bragged about finding dirt on Biden, there is little doubt his appearance would go a long way toward promoting impeachment.They might fear Giuliani’s appearance because he has flat-out admitted to raising the subject of the Bidens with foreign governments and, to boot, has adopted utterly insane conspiracy theories that Trump, his attorney general and a good segment of the Republican Party have bought into.“I'm really frustrated that age has not been more of an issue in this campaign,” said Sarah Small, 28, who came to Harris's event wearing the T-shirt the candidate began selling after confronting Biden on busing.“What this election is about is vision, and I've got a vision that's different than all of my competitors.”

Donald Trump, “Facts.” The president's well-funded reelection campaign keeps adding to a buy that Joe Biden's campaign has accurately called out for furthering falsehoods.In the latest spot, the campaign uses a 2018 clip of Biden talking about pressure on Ukraine's former president — pressure that helped get him to fire a prosecutor opposed by international observers — to insist that Democrats are covering up Biden's corruption.By a small margin, Democrats say that Trump's impeachment-prompting attacks on Biden's son, Hunter, have made them more sympathetic toward Biden, but by a 15-point margin they say Warren is readier to handle the president.2020

LOS ANGELES — Joe Biden remains the biggest obstacle in the path of every other Democratic candidate for president.Even his donors are growing nervous about the attacks on him, asking whether the time it took for him to respond to President Trump — and an effort to keep focused on Biden's policy agenda, steering away from “distraction” — hints at any general election weakness.Meanwhile, Biden's presidential rivals keep declining to pile on.And at the SEIU's two-day candidate forum here, most Democrats again refused to take a swing at Biden.“But specifically with regards to this question, I also think it is not a good idea for us to get sucked into commenting on one of our fellow Democratic competitors when the real story here is the president of the United States confessing on air to the abuse of power, and we cannot allow him to change the subject.”

A little discord came from former congressman Beto O'Rourke, who has swung back and forth in his approach to Biden, from demanding he answer for certain key votes to saying Democrats should not attack one another.“I can't totally follow all the twists of that,” O'Rourke said when asked about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine.“I would not allow a family member, anyone in my Cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that.”

But as the president continues to make incorrect assertions about Biden, no Democrat has defended the story at the center: Hunter Biden's career.Last week, in a CNN interview, Sen.

Joe Biden, “Unhinged.” The former vice president's campaign had been running “general election” ads before this week, with messaging and policy proposals designed as much for independents as for the activists who might actually caucus in Iowa.It's also relying quite a bit on earned media, which the Biden speech quoted in this spot did not dominate — he delivered it at night in Reno, on Pacific time, missing many of that day's news deadlines.It finds two things that cut against Republicans' planning: The president is weak in the swing state that Democrats worry the most about, and attacks on Joe Biden haven't turned many voters away from him.Every major Democratic candidate leads Trump and runs ahead of Hillary Clinton with key voters; none lose rural voters by 27 points, as Clinton did, and Biden loses them by only two points.Biden leads the field with 28 percent to Warren's 22 percent; Sanders, who won the 2016 primary in a landslide, polls at 17 percent.Biden leads with black voters by 39 points over Sanders, who gets 9 percent of their support, while Warren gets 8 percent.Overall, 50 percent of South Carolina's black Democrats pick Biden; 30 percent pick another candidate, and the rest are undecided.That's more than enough to keep Biden ahead of a crowded pack, as no other Democrat has built a powerful constituency here.The continuing weakness of the race's black candidates gives Biden more space here, with Harris, who would be the first black woman president, at just 3 percent with black women.Half of their competitors have yet to announce their totals, but none were on track to pass Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, the other Democrats with eight-figure hauls.Joe Biden.On Friday, he held his first media gaggle since the impeachment inquiry began, unloading on the president as the human "definition of corruption" and chastising reporters who wanted him to talk about Hunter Biden's Ukraine work.Warren, Biden face off on CFPB

Biden had an answer ready when the moderators eventually asked him about his age.“And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.”

Biden calls on foreign policy experience

Playing up his decades of foreign policy experience, Biden said that he’s the only person on the stage who had “spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan,” referring to the leaders of Russia and Turkey.Biden also blasted Trump for how he’s conducted global affairs.“We have an erratic crazy president, who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection,” Biden said.Biden suggested Warren and Sanders needed to be clearer about the high costs of their plan, and he sought to steal some of Buttigieg’s thunder by saying that the mayor’s approach is effectively one he has spearheaded — expanding Obamacare.He said he gets “a little tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel.”

Biden addresses questions on Ukraine

Biden said he did nothing wrong when he worked on Ukrainian policy as vice president while his son was serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.And that's what we should be focusing on,” Biden said.Biden then pivoted to talking about Trump’s corruption, saying a statement his son put out today “speaks for itself.”

Pressed to answer whether it was a mistake for his son to take the position, Biden dodged the question.“I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine,” Biden said.I’m proud of what he had to say.”

It was unclear what judgment Biden was referring to, but he seemed to be talking about his son’s public statement where he said it was a mistake for him to take the job.Candidates talk about impeachment support

In his first comments, Biden said Trump’s decision to stonewall every congressional investigation led him to support the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.Biden drew a contrast between Trump and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.At that time, Biden said lawmakers needed to be mindful of the American people’s vote.“He’s gone so far to say since this latest event … I will not cooperate,” Biden said.“They have no choice but to move.”

Biden, who has found himself at the center of the impeachment inquiry, said nothing more about the specifics of the House investigation or his role in it.He is positioned toward the middle of the stage, to the left of Biden.Warren’s response: “Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.”

Sanders, too, defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that McConnell “has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.”

Biden — who only recently came out in favor of impeachment — called Trump the most corrupt president in history.But Biden doesn’t seem to have a good answer for Trump’s Ukraine attacks.That probably owes to the fact that, even if the allegations about his actions are way beyond the evidence, Hunter Biden’s employment and lucrative salary at a Ukrainian energy company don’t exactly look great.Biden’s lackluster finances were revealed amid growing concerns among some of his allies that his campaign is not equipped for the onslaught of attacks by President Trump.Trump and the Republican Party have already launched a $10 million ad blitz, largely aimed at Biden over his son’s business ties to Ukraine.Biden, meanwhile, has relied on a more traditional fundraising model, appearing at private fundraisers catering to the party’s wealthy donors.The limitations of Biden’s strategy were reflected in his figures from the third quarter — a notoriously difficult time for raising money through private fundraisers, due to the summer lull.AD

Among Biden’s biggest expenses in the third quarter were $924,000 spent on EJCR LLC, a company that offers private jet charter services, records show.AD

Biden campaign officials said they are confident they have the resources they need to build a winning presidential campaign.And we do,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager.Warren had $25.7 million; Buttigieg had $23.4 million; Harris had $10.5 million; and Biden had $9 million.Biden spent $6.7 million in payroll and payroll taxes; $1.3 million on travel; and another $2 million in digital and media ad buys.Biden revealed his campaign’s latest numbers at a private fundraiser in Palo Alto, Calif., Thursday afternoon.President Trump’s campaign mocked Biden’s fundraising haul Thursday evening.Biden held a flurry of fundraisers in the third quarter in an effort to collect checks for his campaign.AD

AD

In the second quarter, Biden raised $21.5 million — one of the largest quarterly hauls reported during that time.But the third quarter is notoriously difficult for fundraising due to the summer lull, especially for candidates like Biden, who do not have an established base of small-dollar online donors.No other candidate polled more than 3 percent.” Warren has been steadily climbing (up 10 percent since August polling) while Biden gradually has been slightly declining (down 4 percent since August).AD

AD

Perhaps worse for Biden, his lead over President Trump, which has bolstered his electability argument, is declining.(“The October poll showed Biden beating Trump 51 percent to 44 percent.He led 54 percent [to] 42 percent in September.”)

Let’s look at five critical questions for Democrats, beginning with Biden.However, at some point either Biden or a Biden alternative from the center of the ideological spectrum is going to need to go directly at voters’ concern that she may be too far left to regain key states lost in 2016.Polling shows that Biden, however, is the second choice of many Sanders voters.Meanwhile, Sanders is the top second choice for Warren supporters, but only by a small margin (24 percent for Sanders versus 21 percent for Biden).Conversely, Biden might have a good case to make that given the wreckage Trump will leave behind, someone with no learning curve needs to get into the Oval Office as soon as possible, especially on the foreign policy realm.(If the public perceives how badly Trump has bollixed up foreign policy and shredded alliances, Biden’s stock may go up.)Behind him are a slew of other candidates who also appear to be waiting for Biden to falter so they can take on the mantle of field’s leading centrist.That’s led to a series of sharp exchanges in advance of Tuesday’s debate in Westerville, Ohio — – including from Biden.“He has tremendous amounts of support and allies at his back, and we’re not going to beat him with pocket change.”

The candidates have occasionally targeted each other before this, including an attack by Harris on Biden on racial issues at the first debate.Nor do campaigns necessarily want to burn through money to see a big increase in the polls right now; for a campaign like that of former vice president Joe Biden, for example, spending less to remain in the lead, as he was on July 1, isn’t a terrible idea.Except that’s not exactly what Biden did.Her campaign surged at the beginning of the quarter after a strong debate against Biden, but ended up spending $14 million in the process of dropping a critical five points in the polling average.It's important, needs to be done, but this isn't the thing that gets you to 270.#DemDebate — Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) October 16, 2019

Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden speaks during the fourth U.S. Democratic presidential candidates' debate Oct. 15.Of the 160 ads taken down this month, 117 belonged to former vice president Joe Biden.“They were removed for violating one or more of Facebook's other advertising policies, such as our policy against using fake buttons in ads.”

But BuzzFeed found that application of the policy has been inconsistent and that dozens of similar Biden ads remained up.Facebook removed 32 more Biden ads flagged by BuzzFeed after reporters reached out.“Evidently Facebook views our graphic design choices as a greater threat to American democracy than Donald Trump's obscene lies,” Biden representative TJ Ducklo told BuzzFeed News.Even Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar, who are running on their ability to forge compromises with Republicans, envision single-handed presidential edicts to tackle issues including climate change and gun violence.In some ways, the issue is drawing a line between candidates, such as former vice president Biden, who see Trump as an aberration, and those who believe the days of bipartisan comity may not return any time soon.Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, is among those arguing that the legislative process, cumbersome though it may be, forces the parties to work together in ways that benefit the country.Not on my watch.”

But even Biden’s platform includes promises such as “on day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach” to tackle climate change.Steve Bullock, who like Biden touts himself as a centrist who can work with Republicans, sees limits to what executive action can achieve, because by definition it shuts out the opposition.Public polling has found a surge toward support for an inquiry since a whistleblower first revealed that the president had leaned on Ukraine's president for dirt on the Biden family; nationally, there is far more enthusiasm about impeachment than there ever was for the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton.“Biden, in fiery remarks, tells Trump: ‘I’m not going anywhere,’ ” by Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Colby Itkowitz

The latest and toughest in what has become a series of Biden-to-Trump speeches.At the time, Clinton was already the Democratic nominee for president, but the health scare sparked such panic that Donna Brazile, the acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, would later reveal that she considered setting in motion a process to replace Clinton with Joe Biden.“The other candidate, Joe Biden: What is his argument resting on?When you go around and you ask people, “What is one thing you know about Joe Biden,” the answer you often get back is, 'he was the vice president to Barack Obama.'Joe Biden has talked less about the risks it took to pass the ACA than about the vision of President Barack Obama; Bennet, by linking himself to the 2010 vote, continues to portray himself as the Democrat who learned something from the Obama-year defeats.POLL WATCH

As the president continues to recast the Ukraine story as a simple question about corruption — he has now called for multiple nations to investigate Biden — his base has followed along faithfully.The question is favorable to Trump’s framing, but the quiet Democratic worry about Biden (or any other Democrat) is that the president can change the discussion around them by throwing as many accusations as Fox News will air.Here, Warren leads Biden among white voters by a 29 to 22 margin; Biden leads the field with black voters, who give him 46 percent of their support to 10 percent for Harris, 9 percent for Warren and 8 percent for Sanders.2020

Joe Biden.But on Wednesday, Biden turned a stop in Reno into a response to Trump, rebutting a TV ad that falsely accuses the former vice president of leaning on Ukraine to stop a prosecutor from investigating his son, Hunter Biden.I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get,” Biden said.Trump, on the other hand, was secretly putting at risk our national security to pursue a personal political vendetta against me because he does not want to run against me.”

It was the third time that Biden had replaced the stump speech with an address about Trump.A goal shared in each of these speeches was elevating Biden above the other Democratic candidates: He was the one who Trump worried about, and the only one with the stature to respond to him.But in Reno, Biden — who’s often talked about Republicans experiencing an "epiphany" once Trump leaves office — singled out the president’s party for criticism.If that keeps up, it would be a small but vital change to the argument Biden is making

BIDEN PROBLEMS: Biden's answers, on the other hand, even on topics he had to know were coming, were sometimes garbled and lacking clear points.He seemed to struggle in a question about his son Hunter Biden's work on the board of an energy company in Ukraine while his father was vice president.Many Democrats were looking for an aggressive takedown of Trump's baseless attacks -- instead Biden was on the defensive."Look, my son's statement speaks for itself," Biden said.Biden said.Hunter Biden said in an interview on Tuesday that he showed "poor judgment" by becoming entangled in foreign business deals but not an ethical lapse.The former veep didn't directly answer the moderator's question about why his son needs to do that now -- if it was OK before: "The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption," Biden said."The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption," Biden said.NEW: Biden's cash on hand is just under $9 million.Biden's campaign, according to our colleagues Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy, "struggled to gain financial steam in the past three months — spending money at a faster clip and having a smaller campaign war chest than his top competitors, according to new filings released Tuesday night."($19.2 million); Biden ($15.7 million); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California ($11.8 million)."Response from the Biden camp: “The fundamental question about fundraising is: Do you have what you need to run your race?And we do,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told Michelle and Anu.The money has funded an ambitious grass-roots campaign operation, and increasingly it has been going to TV and digital ads designed to attract Trump-friendly (but infrequent) donors and to bash Joe Biden.Joe Biden has a war chest problem.Biden had just $9 million in the bank, less than anyone who has led in the polls at this point in the recent history of Democratic primaries.Having sworn off “super PACs” — a collective Democratic decision that has limited big-money impact on the race — Biden has no independent air cover as the president attacks him.(John Minchillo/AP)

Joe Biden.He quickly fired back at Biden in a statement, calling it “sad” that he was “using the talking points of the insurance industry” to attack him.Former vice president Joe Biden holds the lead with black voters, according to polling, suggesting they are not penalizing him for not leading the conversation on this issue.In past debates, Biden, the perceived front-runner, was the target of attacks.Biden began the campaign as the clear leader in the polls but with questions about his candidacy.Her discipline and consistency have paid dividends politically, but as Tuesday’s debate showed, she will become as much a focus of attacks from the other candidates as Biden.Earlier, Biden was seen as the person to beat, with all the others chasing him.Harris went after Biden in the first debate and saw her poll numbers spike.AD

In a later debate, he hectored Biden, accusing him of not being able to remember something Biden had said minutes earlier, in what was widely seen as a veiled attack on the former vice president’s age and mental fitness.McKinley resigned last week amid worsening morale at the State Department and widespread concern that Pompeo has done little to defend diplomats who became ensnared in efforts by Trump to get Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Parnas paid Giuliani $500,000 as a consultant while helping him drum up support for an investigation into Hunter Biden in Ukraine.President, release your tax returns, or shut up,’ Biden says

In an exchange with reporters in Ohio, Biden faced repeated questions about the actions of his son in Ukraine.11:45 a.m.: Trump says Pelosi has ‘done this country a tremendous disservice’

Hours before they were set to meet face-to-face for the first time since the launch of the impeachment inquiry, Trump told reporters that Pelosi has “done this country a tremendous disservice.”

“She’s created a phony witch hunt, another one,” Trump said of the impeachment inquiry focused on his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.Biggs struck a similar note, saying of Schiff: “He’s taken this to a Soviet-style inquiry.”

McCarthy argued that Democrats’ handling of the impeachment inquiry suggests they “believe you’re guilty until you prove your innocence.”

But McCarthy also denied that Trump had asked foreign countries to investigate Biden — even though the president has done so publicly in remarks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.Speaking at a news conference, Jeffries said it was a “textbook abuse of power” for Trump to have pressed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens at a time when nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid was being withheld.Volker previously gave House committees text messages depicting State Department officials apparently coordinating with Giuliani to leverage a public promise of an investigation into the Bidens for a meeting between Trump and Ukraine’s new president.Best moment: “I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.”

Joe Biden.Biden's response to his son's work for a Ukrainian energy company lacked the lectern-slamming power of the speeches he'd been giving over the last two weeks.“My son's statement speaks for itself,” Biden said, referring to a Hunter Biden interview that not all viewers had seen.My son's statement speaks for itself.”

Democratic voters don't think the attacks on Biden, from Trump, have been accurate or fair.Biden's recent stagnation is more about how primary voters view his ability to wage a general election campaign, and in some ways he was less engaged in Ohio than he was during last month's debate in Texas.Biden's habit of packing multiple policies into one answer showed up in a head-scratching response about taxing the very rich.Donors with doubts about Biden have been waiting for the senator from Minnesota to come into her own as a centrist alternative; specifically, they were waiting for her to supplement her own pitch with a case against Warren and Sanders.Like Klobuchar, Buttigieg has become increasingly interesting to donors and voters who have worries about Biden.No one is happier when defending fellow Democrats from attacks, as he did even after a negative question to Biden was long over.He had suffered from attacking Joe Biden last month, a fact that deeply frustrated his supporters — there's a feeling that other candidates can make a debate point and win, but Castro gets singled out as nasty.Joe Biden.THE LIGHTBULB

President Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani have alleged without evidence that former vice president Joe Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine’s top prosecutor to quash a probe into the natural gas company on whose board his son sat.And Hunter Biden's work has put some of the former vice president's 2020 rivals in the awkward position of responding to whether they would want members of their own vice president's family to work at a foreign energy company.Hunter Biden's role at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings is serving as a backdrop of an extraordinary whistleblower complaint accusing Trump of abusing his office for personal gain by pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart in a July 25 phone call to open an investigation into the Bidens.Here are the facts: For five years, the younger Biden served on Burisma's board.The firm's owner came under scrutiny by authorities there, but Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the course of the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden separately pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.Some environmental groups drew a connection between Hunter Biden's role at the Ukraine gas company and energy policies promoted by his dad as vice president, which included helping Ukraine produce its own gas."It's not just Hunter — it's Vice President Biden's multitude of connections to energy experts who continue to push the false narrative that there's a place for gas in a clean energy future," Collin Rees, a campaigner for Oil Change U.S., wrote by email.Rees, whose organization is pressing presidential candidates to renounce donations from fossil-fuel executives as part of a “No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge," noted that Biden attended a New York fundraiser last month hosted by Andrew Goldman, a businessman who helped start a natural gas company."Joe Biden's continued refusal to stand up to the fossil-fuel industry and make it crystal clear that fossil fuels must be kept in the ground and that gas is not a bridge fuel is troubling indeed," Rees added.The Sunrise Movement, which also has cornered candidates at events to ask them to sign the “No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge," declined to comment on Hunter Biden's job history.Back in 2014, Joe Biden flew to Ukraine to announce a U.S. aide package meant to boost Ukrainian gas production."Imagine where you’d be today if you were able to tell Russia: ‘Keep your gas,’” Biden told the Ukrainians.Now five years later, as a presidential candidate, Biden has made a series of commitments to shrink, rather than grow, the use of fossil fuels.Biden has called for the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and — in an major about-face from the Obama administration — has promised to ban new leases for coal, oil and gas extraction on federal land.But Joe Biden has still stopped short of calling for nationwide bans on fracking and on fossil-fuel exports, as some of his Democratic rivals have.Several fellow Democrats running against Biden for president, too, were weary of amplifying an unsubstantiated story about the Biden being pushed by Trump.But the senator from California added that focusing on the Bidens is a "distraction" from the real issue, which is Trump's allegedly corrupt conduct.Harris: probably not...I'm not going to be distracted by what this President is trying to play which is a game

5 minutes.Biden gets a question about his son Hunter, who got a job for a Ukrainian gas company while he held elected office — and whose dealings have become a focus for Trump’s attacks on the former vice president.Biden doesn’t seem to want to answer.That’s what we should be focusing on,” Biden says.CNN cuts to a shot of the four in the center of the stage, Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren, which is a nice compliment for Buttigieg and a dismissal of Harris, who has recently faltered in the polls.He attacks Biden for not backing his bill.Then, he accuses Biden of a lack of courage.She asks why everyone on the stage besides Sanders and herself thinks “it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?” Biden takes offense.Biden seems particularly worked up.Biden, 76, responds to the age question by saying his experience is one of his best qualities.Biden gets a question about whether his platform is bold enough.This leads Biden to praise her.“I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden says.Biden talks about McCain as well.House and Senate committee staff met with the State Department inspector general who gave them a packet of documents containing conspiracy theories about Biden’s son as well as the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.AD

3:15 p.m.: Trump doesn’t answer when asked what he wanted from Ukraine on Bidens

During Wednesday’s joint news conference, Trump refused to answer what exactly he wanted from the Ukrainian president regarding Joe and Hunter Biden.Instead, Trump ignored the question and focused his answer on why he held back military aid to Ukraine, citing, as he has in the past, corruption in Ukraine and the unsubstantiated claim that the United States is the “only one who gives the big money to Ukraine.”

When Reuters’s Jeff Mason tried again and again to ask the Biden-specific question, Trump became angry and demanded that Mason “not be rude” and instead ask a question of the Finnish president.When Mason pressed him, Trump responded that “Biden and his son are stone cold crooked,” then leveled his oft-made attack against the “fake news” media.Asked about the episode during a news conference in Rome, Pompeo said, “I was on the phone call.”

In response to a multipart question, he did not say whether he was comfortable with Trump’s pressing of Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston who volunteered last weekend at the Blue Jamboree, an annual Democratic gathering, said she is enamored with several of the Democrats, but believes Biden would be most likely to defeat Trump.“He knows the Washington game.”

Republicans have stepped up their attacks on Biden in recent weeks, noting that his son Hunter sat on the board of a Ukrainian company while Biden was spearheading the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy.But many Democrats continue to consider Biden to have the best chance of defeating Trump, and for a significant portion that is the overriding factor.AD

Some of Biden’s rivals hope that if he stumbles in the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary, Democrats in states like South Carolina, which votes a short time later, will reconsider their support.But James noted that South Carolina is the first primary state with a significant number of African American voters and said he would consider Biden the best candidate even if he doesn’t win any primary states before South Carolina.“Even if someone else wins [Iowa or New Hampshire], that doesn’t say how you’ll do with black voters.”

Biden over his career has forged strong ties in South Carolina and especially with African Americans, who make up nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters in the Palmetto State.AD

Biden also has decades of relationships with South Carolinians.At Clyburn’s annual fish fry in June, a South Carolina mainstay for those who want to be president, Biden shook hands and took photos along a rope line until nearly midnight.Maria Washington, 64, of Charleston, said she was a Biden fan well before then.“I’m ride or die Biden,” she said as she ate a barbecue lunch Saturday at the Blue Jamboree.Biden has been on an even keel for 40 years.”

Washington’s friend, Hermine Hawkins, who like Washington is black, said her questions about whether Biden would be good for African Americans were answered when President Barack Obama selected him as a running mate.Still, critics have been particularly vocal in recent weeks, and Biden has faced threats to his presidential aspirations from multiple fronts.On Wednesday, Biden called for Trump’s impeachment, using his strongest language yet, in an offensive that came as Trump has inundated Twitter with false claims about the Bidens and Ukraine.That same day, the president’s reelection campaign announced a $10 million ad buy targeting Biden and focused on early-voting states.AD

But those setbacks have not significantly dented Biden’s support.AD

For Biden’s Palmetto State supporters, the question is whether he can win there in a way that propels him for the contests that follow.Williams, the state representative, predicted that Biden’s success in South Carolina “is going to send a message to the rest of the country.”

Biden, he said, hasn’t offered enough new ideas for younger Democrats to embrace him.A USA Today/Suffolk poll this week showed Biden and Warren tied in Iowa, with Buttigieg a few points behind, feeding worry among party leaders that the race could remain unsettled for a long while, as Trump whales on the Democratic field.This came a week before Trump’s July 25 call, in which he pressured Zelensky to carry out “investigations” designed to undercut the fact of Russian sabotage of the 2016 election, and to manufacture smears of potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.Giuliani confirmed he planned to urge Zelensky to pursue investigations designed to fortify a conspiracy theory undercutting the fact of Russian interference, and to push a false narrative involving the role of Biden’s son on the board of Ukrainian company Burisma.And at the time, Giuliani repeatedly tweeted demands that Ukraine investigate Biden.Trump himself railed on Fox in May about the invented narrative of Biden corruption in Ukraine.And in multiple subsequent texts, Volker and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who was operating at Trump’s direction, worked to get what Sondland called the “deliverable,” a statement from Ukraine pledging to investigate Burisma, the fabricated tale about Biden.Sondland is expected to testify Thursday that for months before the call, he was working to secure that commitment from Ukraine — to investigate Biden.But what all this also confirms is that, by “investigate corruption,” Trump really meant, “investigate Biden.” Indeed, Ambassador William Taylor twice objected to what was happening on precisely those grounds.Mulvaney’s role in meetings

Underscoring that further, The Post reports that Mulvaney was directly involved in numerous discussions with Sondland about the evolving plot, and sat in on meetings between Trump and Giuliani at precisely the time Giuliani was explicitly pushing for the Ukrainian investigation of Biden.Carpe Donktum’s memes, which have often been widely boosted by Trump supporters on sites such as Reddit and Twitter, include one in which he animated former vice president Joe Biden’s apology video to show the candidate caressing his own shoulders.But that pitch was mostly aimed at Biden, at the time the clear leader in the polls.Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at “the appropriate time.” Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)Polls show Biden, Warren and Sanders are the three leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, and a younger generation of White House hopefuls has struggled to keep pace with them.And former vice president Joe Biden, who leads many polls, raised about $15.2 million in the quarter, his campaign said.Former vice president Joe Biden, who has spent most of the race as the leader in the polls, has faced daily attacks from Trump over largely unfounded allegations about his son Hunter’s foreign business dealings, highlighting a potential vulnerability for the candidate many saw as the best hope for beating Trump.Trump’s early and fierce focus on Biden — which includes public requests for foreign leaders to investigate his family — has challenged the former vice president to prove his ability to fight back.There’s not a shred of evidence of anything done was wrong,” Biden told reporters Friday.No president.”

But there are signs that Trump’s attacks are having an effect, even among prospective Biden supporters.One Biden volunteer, Marcie Lammers of Las Vegas, who showed up to his Las Vegas event last month wearing a Biden T-shirt, said the backlash to the impeachment news was clear in the phone calls she has been making for her candidate.“I know it’s getting in the way,” she said of the impeachment talk and Trump’s accusations about the Bidens’ actions involving Ukraine.“When I do the phone banking, at first people said ‘Well, I’m thinking about Joe or I’m leaning toward Joe.’ Now, the people that do pick up the phone, they say, ‘Well if he wants to collect money, why doesn’t he just get it from Ukraine?’ ”

The danger for Biden, strategists say, is that voters look past the details of Trump’s charges of corruption against him, many of which have been debunked, and fear the impact.Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had previously investigated a company where his son worked — but he was carrying out U.S. policy with the support of other Western governments, not intervening on behalf of his family.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing as part of investigation into his Ukrainian employer, which was dormant at the time his father sought the dismissal.AD

AD

At the same time, several party strategists say Biden still has an opportunity to take advantage of the attention Trump has directed at him.The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have announced $10 million in spending on campaign ads that misleadingly attack Biden for his work in Ukraine.Biden has begun airing an ad that directly takes on Trump and accuses him of trying to engineer the selection of the Democratic nominee.“Biden’s best positioning is when it is him versus Trump in the primary,” said David Plouffe, a top adviser to Barack Obama’s two presidential campaigns who now hosts the Campaign HQ podcast.Get yourself on the news and do it.”

The Trump onslaught has revealed growing frustration among some Biden supporters that top party officials — as well as some of his rivals — have not done more to rally behind him during what they view as a moment of crisis fomented by Trump.“I’m disappointed in a lot of the leaders in our party who are allowing the GOP to do what they do very well,” said Harold A. Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Firefighters and a fierce Biden backer.The flurry of impeachment news and distractions for Sanders and Biden have accrued so far to Warren’s benefit, disrupting other Democrats’ efforts to more directly challenge her ideas and background.If it starts to look like Warren will win the party’s nomination, a longtime Democratic bundler said, “there will be efforts to stop that.”

“Right now, they think Joe Biden stands between us and Elizabeth/Bernie — and to defeat in 2020,” said the bundler, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.That is particularly true among those who see themselves as alternatives to Biden.Former vice president Joe Biden faces questions about his son’s role in Ukraine, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)“Biden has to prove that he is the most electable.Before an earlier debate, advisers urged Sanders to sharply criticize Biden’s relationship with his donors, but he shied away from a full-on attack.My heart goes out to him,” said Steve Westly, a California investor who is fundraising for Biden.You just, you can’t have people thinking you’re old, tired and likely to have serious health issues.”

Westly added, “It’s just hard to put a good spin on that one.”

Yet Biden is 76.Biden and Warren probably will face scrutiny on other fronts during the debate, strategists said.Congressional Democrats have embarked on an impeachment inquiry following revelations that Trump pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.Trump and his allies have launched attacks on Biden that are unfounded but that some Democrats worry will nevertheless take a toll on his candidacy.And even some Democrats question why Hunter Biden was serving on the board of a Ukrainian firm while his father was the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.They wonder whether the furor will affect Biden’s electability, which is his main appeal for many Democrats.Biden plans to challenge Trump in the debate, according to a person familiar with his strategy, and argue that the president is trying to handpick his 2020 opponent.There could, still, be a moment to break out; there could be a scramble to find a “Biden alternative,” something candidates in the middle of the pack have spent months waiting for.Bennet, who delayed the start of his campaign until after a successful cancer surgery, raised $2.8 million in his first two months as a candidate and has gotten raves from center-left tastemakers nervous about Joe Biden's age and messaging.More than two years after entering the race, he is repositioning himself as the only candidate with business experience and business-friendly trade policies; not even Joe Biden, he points out, still supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Some campaigns refuse to say whether they saw particular boosts on particular days, and the Biden campaign offered no hint of its post-whistleblower fundraising, apart from a donor email warning that “Joe won’t have as much cash as Trump when the fundraising deadline hits.” There is no paid “covering fire” for Biden, or any Democrats; there is plenty for Republicans.Did Joe Biden put pressure on Ukranian officials to lay off his son?(Monmouth, 1,161 registered voters)

To Democrats' dismay, whether they want Biden to be the nominee, the Trump administration and conservative media mobilized quickly after last week's whistleblower revelations, urging voters to ask whether Joe Biden was behaving ethically.No reporting has turned up evidence that Biden, who has spoken about the pressure he put on Ukraine to sack an incompetent prosecutor, made moves that directly helped his son, Hunter Biden, when he worked for a state energy company.AD

The massive third-quarter haul is welcome news for Sanders supporters, who have seen their candidate fall behind former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)“But I think it’s helpful for him to do that and it’s certainly only a decision that he can make, but I do think this is an opportunity for him to talk.”

Sanders has been trailing former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)Facing a younger crop of Democratic candidates running on generational change, Biden, Warren and Sanders have sought creative ways to project youthfulness and vigor.Biden told reporters over the summer he rides a Peloton bike to keep fit.Biden, whose gaffes, misstatements and sometimes meandering speeches have plagued his campaign, has absorbed the brunt of these broadsides.AD

At the first Democratic debate, then-candidate Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) urged Biden to “pass the torch.” Biden snapped back, “I’m still holding onto that torch!”

In the September debate, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro went after Biden in a way that many saw as a dig at his mental acuity.“Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?” Castro asked Biden during a heated exchange over health care.After the debate, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) took his own swipe at Biden.“I think that we are at a tough point right now because there’s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,” Booker told CNN.AD

The next day, Biden promised to release his medical records “before there’s a first vote,” referring to the Iowa caucuses Feb. 3.He also tried to defuse the tension surrounding the subject, jokingly asking a reporter, “Man, you want to wrestle?”

AD

That didn’t put the topic to rest, and Trump has been particularly persistent in needling Biden about his mental sharpness.“I’m in good health and running a vigorous campaign.”

Sanders, Biden and Warren have all committed to releasing their health records before the first nominating contest, although none has done so yet.That tempo contrasts sharply with Biden, who normally conducts one or two events a day.More than two months before the phone call that launched the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Ukraine’s newly elected leader was already worried about pressure from the U.S. president to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden.There’s uncertainty in the underlying polls, which carries over into the predictions; we don’t know exactly what would happen if Joe Biden won 48.5 percent of the national popular vote, for example.AD

But these patterns suggest Biden may be wrong in arguing that he is best positioned to beat Trump.Biden has proposed adding a public option that would allow people to choose between a private insurance plan or one offered by the federal government.Likewise, the Democrats running for president are standing behind Joe Biden as he gets attacked by President Trump over his son Hunter’s work in Ukraine.When asked directly whether they’d allow their children to sit on the boards of foreign companies, the Democratic candidates either have tried to change the subject or have said no while attempting to make the discussion as abstract as possible so as not to appear to be criticizing Biden.Yet, in private, you won’t get much disagreement among Democrats that as dishonest as Trump’s attacks on Biden are, and notwithstanding the fact that Trump is the most corrupt president in history, Hunter Biden’s deal with a Ukrainian energy company was, well, kind of sleazy.That tells you nothing about what sort of president Joe Biden would be, but there’s still a widespread discomfort with the possibility that the Hunter Biden story could allow Trump to muddy the waters at a time when his corruption should and will be one of the main issues of the campaign.His team has the digital sais quoi that former vice president Joe Biden might envy as he goes toe-to-toe with Trump and his online empire over deceptive claims about nepotism and foreign dealings.Lee’s and Narayanswamy’s big takeaway is that former vice president Joe Biden isn’t raising front-runner money but is spending heavily; he raised the fourth-most in the field from July through September and has the fifth-most cash on hand.He was also witty, joking with Biden after Biden gestured at him while talking about Vladimir Putin.#DemDebate — Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) October 16, 2019

Losers

Biden: Not only does he seem to no longer be the candidate his opponents fear most, he was again somewhat off his game.Biden hasn’t really dropped in the polls as Warren has risen, but he is not showing the sharper version of himself that he probably needs to.AD

Booker’s Biden question gripe: We get it; there’s no safer applause line than attacking the refs, and Democrats are angry about how 2016 was handled by the media.Booker took up the mantle we knew someone would when he attacked a question Biden faced about his son Hunter’s overseas work.Anderson Cooper rightly noted that the major accusations President Trump has lodged against the Bidens are unsubstantiated — twice.Cooper also asked a very fair question about why Hunter Biden is ruling out working overseas if his dad becomes president, when they say there was nothing wrong with him doing it when his dad was vice president.AD

Biden’s answer to that question: Biden was asked that question twice, and he said three times, “My son’s statement speaks for itself,” which isn’t really an answer.I’m proud of the judgment he made.” It’s okay to point out Trump’s allegations are baseless while acknowledging Hunter Biden’s overseas work perhaps wasn’t a great idea — which is what his new pledge tacitly seems to acknowledge.Trump is in trouble for, essentially, trying to coerce Ukraine into doing something corrupt on his behalf while he claims that Joe Biden was doing something corrupt by demanding the removal of a corrupt official who refused to investigate corruption.As anyone watching the campaign knows, Biden puts his focus on Trump as an individual, saying that once we get rid of him, we can return to normal.While he has some plans that are more liberal than those advocated by any Democratic nominee in the past few decades, on a fundamental level Biden sees the system as a healthy one that mostly requires personnel changes and some policy recalibration.If any of the other candidates prevails, they’ll make claims similar to Biden’s, that Trump is the core of the problem.So all the fantastical lies he and other Republicans are now telling about Biden are in effect a dry run for 2020, whether or not Biden is the nominee.And the longer Biden lasts as the broccoli candidate — not fun but good for you — the more time there will be for two grown-ups, Minnesota’s Amy Klobuchar and Colorado’s Michael F. Bennet, both senators, to thrive as unrecycled moderates.Sometimes you just have to muck around.”

As the information wars heat up over the possible impeachment of President Trump for soliciting foreign help to investigate the Biden family, more acute than ever is the question of who, if anyone, controls information about the second son of the former vice president.XOR’easter, who says he has no connection to the Biden campaign, says his sole motive is protecting the truth.Hunter Biden served nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, which was investigated by Ukrainian prosecutors.AD

Joe Biden later pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who, in the judgment of the United States and other Western countries, was not sufficiently pursuing corruption in Ukraine.The task of elucidating these details on Hunter Biden’s Wikipedia page — a political and epistemic minefield — has been shouldered by the physicist-editor.He set to work revising the information about Hunter Biden on Friday night after seeing an image of the page on Twitter.Then he contacted an administrator and urged him to keep an eye on the Hunter Biden page in case it became a magnet for trolling.Eliminating details about Biden’s relationships, one user wrote, “Cut it out with this tabloid stuff.” The information was later restored by another anonymous user, who deemed the detail a “non-salacious reference to his relationship with his sister-in-law.” (Hunter Biden at one point was romantically involved with his late brother Beau’s widow.)The group in May asked the State Department for records related to alleged efforts by Trump and his administration to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.“He mentioned both the accusations about Vice President Biden and about interference in the 2016 election,” Mr. Volker told Congress, adding that Mr. Giuliani “stressed that all he wanted to see was for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past.”

Mr. Volker then worked with a top aide to Mr. Zelensky, Andrey Yermak, to set up the July 25 phone call.Good luck!” During the call, Mr. Trump requested investigations both of the DNC hack and of Mr. Biden; Mr. Zelensky promised to comply; and Mr. Trump seemed to offer a visit to Washington.The Ukrainians duly produced a draft statement that was “generic” about corruption, Mr. Volker said — only to have it rejected by Mr. Giuliani, who said that “the statement should include specific reference to ‘Burisma’ and ‘2016.’ ” Burisma was the gas company that Mr. Biden’s son Hunter was associated with.But it will be logic to do after we receive a confirmation of date.” Again, the trade-off of a White House meeting for a promise to investigate the Bidens and the DNC was explicit.On Sept. 8, Mr. Taylor said, Mr. Sondland informed him that after talking to Mr. Trump, he had told Mr. Zelensky that if he “did not ‘clear things up’ in public, we would be at a ‘stalemate.’ ” Added Mr. Taylor: “I understood a ‘stalemate’ to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance.”

The Ukrainians eventually told Mr. Volker that they did not want to promise investigations of Mr. Biden and the Democrats.Neither of those foreign leaders specifically encouraged Trump to see Ukraine as a potential source of damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, nor did they describe Kyiv as complicit in an unsubstantiated 2016 election conspiracy theory, officials said.U.S. officials emphasized that while Putin and Orban denigrated Ukraine, Trump’s decision to seek damaging material on Biden was more directly driven by Trump’s own impulses and Kyiv conspiracy theories promoted by his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.There is no evidence that Putin spoke about Biden or endorsed Giuliani’s unsubstantiated claims that it was Ukraine — and not Russia — that had interfered in the 2016 election.-- The Wall Street Journal reported last night and the Associated Press confirmed that Mike Pompeo, Tillerson’s replacement, was listening in live on July 25 when Trump prodded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden’s son.Barr’s spokeswoman stated last week that the attorney general was unaware of Trump’s effort to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and that he never spoke with the president nor the Ukrainians about the issue.“I think I saw a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister that said there was no pressure applied in the course of the conversation,” Pompeo said, adding that Biden is the one who should be investigated.Republicans have criticized this rationale, saying Democrats only want the documents as a way to target a political enemy.”

QUOTE OF THE DAY: "If they want sunshine, I say bring it,” said former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, demanding an investigation into Biden if Democrats move to impeach.Conspiracies fly free: For right wing media, the real question is not whether Trump should be impeached — but why former vice president Joe Biden is not the focus of the investigation for his son's involvement in an obscure Ukrainian gas company.The men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, have been assisting Giuliani’s push to get Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son and Giuliani’s claim that Democrats conspired with Ukrainians in the 2016 campaign.While not necessarily an illegal act, it does run counter to an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2009 that says information can’t be classified to ‘conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error’ or ‘prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency.’”

-- Only four in 10 Republicans believe Trump mentioned Biden in his call to Ukraine, even though the president acknowledged doing so.In comparison, 85% of Democrats and 61% of independents surveyed by Monmouth University Poll said Trump ‘probably did’ mention the possibility of an investigation into the Biden family.announced he is drafting legislation to ban immediate family members of senators, members of Congress, the president or the vice president from working for “any entity doing business in or with Ukraine.” This is an indirect shot at Hunter Biden, whose father is no longer vice president and who no longer works for a Ukrainian company.Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event on Sept. 27 in Las Vegas.If Joe Biden wants to successfully raise lots of money from the tech industry's elite, he'll have to convince them he has some.But Biden has talked more on debate stages about record players than privacy or artificial intelligence.This afternoon, Biden will attend a lunch reception in Palo Alto, hosted by Bay Area donors including Ambassador Denise Bauer, entrepreneur Jon Fisher and real-estate broker George Marcus.Biden's push in the Bay Area follows challenges winning over people in the tech industry reflected this summer in fundraising data.One reason Biden may not be generating buzz in Silicon Valley is that he has been fairly silent on tech issues, especially as some of his Democratic rivals step up their attacks on the industry.Other candidates have been aggressively addressing data collection, while Biden has said little about privacy issues on the campaign trail.As Buttigieg rallied in support of California's new labor legislation and released a plan to reclassify independent contractors as employees, Biden's camp did not respond to Washington Post requests about his position on gig economy worker classification.Biden's silence on these issues has led to less attention in Silicon Valley.“You don't hear too much water cooler talk about [Biden's] positions,” one tech company employee told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.But while Biden might not be talking about net neutrality or encryption, he still could rally tech insiders' wallets and hearts for a key reason — His argument that he's well positioned to beat President Trump.“I'm going to line up and support whichever candidate wins the nomination, and I've donated to several of them, including Biden,” said Hunter Walk, a Homebrew partner.PUBLIC CLOUD

"I'm not going anywhere," @JoeBiden told President Trump [and everyone] tonight.Months later, the president used Pence to tell Zelensky that U.S. aid was still being withheld while demanding more aggressive action on corruption ... At that time — following Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelenksy — the Ukrainians probably understood action on corruption to include the investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Officials close to Pence insist that he was unaware of Trump’s efforts to press Zelensky for damaging information about Biden and his son…

“Pence’s activities occurred amid several indications of the president’s hidden agenda.“He’s almost not worth it, to do an impeachment, because he is so what he is, but the Constitution is worth it, and our democracy is worth it, and our 'Republic, if we can keep it' is worth it.”

-- Biden struck a defiant tone during a campaign speech last night in Reno, ripping Trump’s efforts to smear him and assuring supporters that the president won’t destroy his candidacy.Cleve Wootson reports from Nevada with Colby Itkowitz: “Biden, who spent four decades in the Senate, has in the past sought to separate Trump and his base from the Republican Party that contains his friends and peers … But in his remarks here, Biden slammed the GOP and ‘hatchet men’ who he said echo Trump’s words.… Biden said the attacks by Trump were an attempt to ‘pick his opponent and go against only the candidates he thinks he can beat.’ … Democrats have begun to worry that Trump’s relentless attacks on Biden will weigh on the campaign, even if they’re baseless.… In the roughly 30 minutes that Biden spoke, he didn’t touch on the appearance of a conflict of interest.”

-- In a lengthy essay for the Atlantic, George Conway – husband of Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway – argues that the president’s erratic behavior and narcissistic personality make him unfit for office: “Simply put, Trump’s ingrained and extreme behavioral characteristics make it impossible for him to carry out the duties of the presidency in the way the Constitution requires.From Politico: “The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling numbers have declined and [Warren’s] have surged … The former vice president’s campaign is still counting on strong finishes in the four early nominating states.But in the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden.But they’re making arguments when they tell a story.’

-- For those who recall the “Clinton Cash” controversy, the baseless tales claiming that Biden corruptly intervened on behalf of his son’s Ukrainian business interests feel a lot like the movie “Groundhog Day,” writes the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer in a recap of how the Ukraine conspiracy theory came to be.2:35 p.m.: Trump ‘must stop stonewalling,’ Biden says

Former vice president Joe Biden responded to the Trump administration’s efforts to block Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, from testifying by arguing that the president should cooperate with lawmakers.“President Trump must stop stonewalling Congress and fully cooperate with the investigations,” Biden said in a tweet.“Given the apparent depth of his involvement in the president’s effort to convince foreign governments to investigate a political rival, he must testify under oath.”

Schumer was referring to Trump’s effort to persuade the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Giuliani, meanwhile, said that he is “very interested” in accepting Graham’s officer to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee but that “there are a lot of legal issues to consider.”

“Graham wants me to lay out in one place, in one time the Ukrainian collusion and the Biden corruption,” Giuliani said, adding that the idea for him to testify was not his.Schiff said that the Trump administration had also directed Sondland not to share text messages relevant to the inquiry, which focuses on a July phone call in which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.10:15 a.m.: Graham say he’ll invite Giuliani to testify on Ukraine corruption

Graham said Tuesday that he would invite Giuliani to testify before his panel about “corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine.”

Giuliani has pressed Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, and the firing of the prosecutor who had investigated it.Sondland was scheduled to be deposed by lawmakers about his activities as Trump urged Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.Sondland worked closely with Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, to shape U.S. foreign policy around Trump’s desire to investigate Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 presidential election to undermine Trump’s candidacy.The findings in the Washington Post-Schar School poll indicate that public opinion has shifted quickly against the president and in favor of impeachment proceedings in recent weeks as information has been released about Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukrainian government officials to undertake an investigation into Biden, a potential 2020 campaign rival, and Biden’s son Hunter.Rubio drew a distinction between his refusal to criticize Trump for asking China to investigate Joe Biden (he insists the president was joking) and upbraiding the NBA for currying favor with China:

The brave #BlueCheckBrigade has trouble distinguishing between what is inappropriate & what is dangerous.POTUS asking #China to investigate Biden is wrong, but it isn’t going to happen.Broken down by age groups, 40 percent of Republican-leaning adults ages 18-39 endorse the start of the impeachment inquiry, compared with 23 percent of those ages 40-64 and 13 percent of those age 65 and older.”

Asked about the contents of Trump’s telephone call with Ukraine’s president, 62 percent say Trump’s request to investigate Joe Biden and his son was inappropriate (compared to 32 percent who felt it was not): “Asked whether the president upholds adequate standards for ethics in government, 60 percent of Americans say he does not, while 35 percent say he does.”

But Trump’s attacks seem to be taking a toll on Biden: Asked whether the former vice president would uphold adequate ethics standards in government if he’s elected president, 47 percent said yes, while 38 percent said no.The results were split among partisan lines, with 72 percent of Democrats saying Biden would uphold ethical standards, while 63 percent of Republicans say he would not.But there is no indication that Pompeo objected when Trump withheld all of the assistance while Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani — and the president himself — pressed the government of [Ukraine] to investigate [the Bidens].From the Columbus Dispatch: “‘The president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period.From Karoun, Josh, Shane and John: “The whistleblower wrote in a two-page memo that the intelligence community’s inspector general provided last week to the congressional intelligence committees that a White House official called the substance of the July 25 call ‘crazy’ and ‘frightening’ and suggested that Trump may have violated federal election laws by asking Zelensky for a ‘favor’ of investigating the Bidens.And when the institutions don’t work, that is a national security threat.’ She was among 90 national security veterans who signed an open letter published Sunday in support of the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint that Trump had acted improperly in asking the Ukrainian president to investigate [Joe] Biden in a July phone call.In April 2018, then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ordered Ukraine’s top anti-corruption prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko—who’d been tasked with investigating corruption that occurred under former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych—to stop cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller.”

-- China publicly rejected Trump’s call to investigate Joe Biden and his son.Our position is consistent and clear.’ … In addition to maintaining the non-interference principle, a Chinese investigation into the Bidens would be likely to offend both Democrats and Republicans, further intensifying concerns that China is interfering in U.S. presidential election.”

-- Trump loyalists in the House were blindsided when the White House blocked Sondland from testifying.“The Democrats in the House want to destroy the president.” Last month, Fox News's Chris Wallace reported that diGenova and his wife helped Giuliani get “oppo research” on Biden.She made her first run for office in 2012.”

-- Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) endorsed Biden for president, snubbing California's junior senator, Kamala Harris, per the San Francisco Chronicle.The two men, who helped Giuliani investigate former vice president Joe Biden, were charged with campaign finance violations, according to a person familiar with the charges.-- Biden made his most direct call yet for Trump’s impeachment, saying it is time the president be removed from office to preserve “our democracy and our basic integrity.” Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Felicia Sonmez report: “China, Biden said, ‘was the third foreign power that we know of that [Trump] has asked in clear, unmistakable language to intervene on his behalf in the democratic proceedings of the United States,’ the former vice president said, referring to public remarks Trump made last week on the White House lawn.‘President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with a congressional inquiry ... He’s already convicted himself,’ Biden said.-- Biden’s campaign ripped the New York Times for running an op-ed by conservative author Peter Schweizer.Tim Elfrink reports: “In a letter sent to New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, Biden’s campaign called Schweizer a ‘discredited right-wing polemicist’ and suggested the op-ed was part of a larger pattern of ‘journalistic malpractice.’ ‘Are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?’ Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, wrote in the Wednesday letter ...#STAYINTHEFIGHT #BeatLA — Mark S.

Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale joined his boss in calling the impeachment inquiry a "coup" attempt:

This isn't the fourth impeachment attempt in American History by Democrats.Michael Pillsbury, one of Trump’s China advisers, publicly contradicted himself on whether he received information on Hunter Biden during a visit to Beijing shortly after Trump called on China to investigate the son of the former vice president.“I got a quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese,” Pillsbury was quoted as telling the Financial Times.“Pillsbury said he spoke with Trump just before he went on his trip to China last month, but he said the president didn’t ask him to raise Biden to Chinese officials,” David Lynch and Dawsey report.“The China expert said he’d never spoken with Trump about Hunter Biden but was aware of the president calling for the Chinese to investigate from the South Lawn of the White House last week.Devlin Barrett, John Wagner and Rosalind S.

2020 WATCH:

-- Trump attacked the Bidens in personal and coarse terms during a rally in Minneapolis last night.Seung Min Kim and Aaron Blake report: “Trump repeated his dubious claims that Hunter Biden secured $1.5 billion for an investment fund in China while his father served as Barack Obama’s vice president and mocked Hunter Biden’s personal problems, including his discharge from the Navy after he tested positive for cocaine use.… Mocking Hunter Biden’s lack of public appearances, Trump bellowed: ‘Whatever happened to Hunter?… [Joe] Biden ‘was never considered smart,’ Trump said.Just more than half had unemployment rates above the national average for July, while some were well below that benchmark.”

-- Biden has slipped in the polls and has become the target of Trump’s ire, but he maintains a sizable and loyal following.… Shedron Williams, a state representative from Hampton, S.C., predicted that ‘Biden is going to do well in South Carolina.’ Williams has not endorsed the former vice president, but said he continues to be popular among black voters.Craig Timberg, Tony Romm and Drew Harwell report: “Warren … made this point in a Facebook ad Thursday in which she joked that the company had endorsed Trump, adding that its policies allow ‘a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people.’ Warren’s ad was the latest salvo in a growing campaign by Democrats to pressure social media companies to curb Trump’s ability to push demonstrably untrue information on their platforms.”

QUOTE OF THE DAY: “We don’t need to lock him up,” Eric Trump said of Hunter Biden during his father's rally in Minneapolis.During a July 25 phone call, Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into one of his political rivals, former vice president Joe Biden.The move would have tarnished the character of Trump’s potential 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, whose son served on the company’s board.Sondland plans to say that over the following weeks, he and Volker, along with the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor, learned that as a condition of such a meeting, Giuliani was demanding that Zelensky’s administration publicly announce it would tackle corruption, including singling out as a target Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company linked to Biden’s son.“It’s quite possible we never mentioned Biden.Of course, Biden was part of that.”

Giuliani said that Sondland and Volker were often on conference calls together and that Sondland was keeping tabs on Giuliani’s work on the effort, speaking with him about six times over the summer.Sondland plans to say he was unaware until a whistleblower’s complaint became public late last month that Biden’s son Hunter had been a Burisma board member and that some government officials suspected Trump’s goal was to tarnish the character of a potential 2020 Democratic challenger.In their discussions, Giuliani never mentioned the Biden connection, the person with knowledge of Sondland’s testimony said.In televised appearances, Giuliani had by then repeatedly raised concerns over Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma, and numerous newspaper and magazine articles had questioned whether the issue could prove to be a drag on his father’s presidential campaign.The person with knowledge of Sondland’s testimony said that Sondland took Trump at his word at the time but that he has no knowledge of whether the president’s statement was true, as he only learned details such as the importance of the Biden mention from the whistleblower’s complaint.The president's reelection campaign went on the air against Joe Biden — who was facing more and more questions from Democrats who had considered him their most electable candidate.Three weeks ago, Democrats expected the start of the impeachment inquiry to freeze the presidential primary in place, crowding out candidates who hadn't commanded attention yet and giving center stage to Biden.Polling has found that Democrats even view Biden a bit more favorably because they believe the president made a false attack on his family.When asked about the story and whether it was ethical for Biden's son Hunter to take a lucrative job with a Ukrainian energy company, every Democrat has swatted the question away.No candidate has engaged with the substance of Republicans' “Quid Pro Joe” attack, which actually allowed Biden, on Sunday, to beat them on introducing a specific anti-nepotism ethics policy.“No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in a meeting as if they’re a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation,” Biden said, going after the president for giving political and policy work to his daughter, his adult sons and his son-in-law.With mixed success, Biden has tried to turn the story into one of the president trying to disqualify his strongest opponent.It's also not in their interest to side with the president against Biden.Any Democrat who uses the issue to raise questions about Biden's electability will be making news.The bounce from Harris’s own first debate showdown with Biden has faded.Castro’s numbers, both his personal favorable and his strength in trial heats, have declined to near-zero since he audaciously told Biden, last month, that he had forgotten the details of his own health-care plan.“Hunter Biden says role with Ukraine firm was 'poor judgment' but not 'improper,' ” by Cleve R. Wootson Jr.In April, when Biden joined the race, 56 percent of Democrats considered him to be their strongest general election candidate.What had been a 53-point deficit to Biden has shrunk to 27 points.Among all white Democrats, she leads by 14 points; white Democrats say Biden is more electable by 21 points.“His health issues have cast a degree of uncertainty over his campaign and left his aides rushing to reassure voters about his age and health, just as he was trying to improve his standing in a race that in recent weeks has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,” Sydney reports.The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, the energy company, and Biden — something that made Bolton go ‘ballistic’ after the meeting, the official said.”

— A possible breakthrough in producing lithium: A geothermal energy company says it has figured out how to extract lithium from the Salton Sea in California — the location of one of the world’s most powerful natural geothermal hot spots, the Los Angeles Times reports.She was not told that Mr. Trump would use the call to press for an investigation into [Hunter] Biden, nor did she know about the president’s decision to withhold $391 million in American assistance to Ukraine until shortly before her departure, according to one person informed about her account.”

National security adviser John Bolton listens as President Trump speaks in the Oval Office on June 12.Volker, who was the special U.S. envoy to Ukraine, testified under oath that he warned Giuliani against trusting the information he was receiving from Ukrainian political figures about Joe Biden and his son.Biden, who will certainly face questions about his relationship with Ukraine and his son's foreign buckraking, unveiled an ethics plan.Mike Bloomberg, another billionaire, continues to hint that he might run for president if Biden drops out.“People close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary," CNBC reports.-- Hunter Biden, in an interview with ABC News that aired this morning, insisted he did nothing wrong but acknowledged that “it was poor judgment” to “be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways.” Sitting down in the kitchen of his Los Angeles home, the former vice president’s son said: “I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father.— Donald J.

COOPER: Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, you said, and I quote, “The American people don't think that they've made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton, and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision.” With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump's attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter.Vice President Biden?Vice President Biden...

BURNETT: Vice President Biden, if you're elected, you will turn 80 during your first term.Vice President Biden, the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court.COOPER: Vice President Biden, you can respond, and then Senator Warren.Vice President Biden?Former vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing, as the rest of the field appeared reluctant early in the debate to echo Republican criticisms of Biden’s son, Hunter, and his work on the board of a Ukranian energy company while his father was the Obama administration’s point person there.Attacks on Biden’s more moderate positions were fleeting, unlike in earlier debates.AD

As the debate began, the moment felt particularly tenuous for Biden, whose campaign has been rattled by attacks from Trump about his son Hunter that have temporarily overshadowed concerns that some Democratic primary voters had previously voiced about a record they view as out of step with the base of the party.AD

Biden’s lukewarm debate performances and his halting response to Trump have only elevated those concerns, which have become evident in declining poll numbers and a fundraising haul that was eclipsed by all of his major primary rivals.In the days leading up to the debate, Biden and his son launched twin efforts to try to alleviate concerns that Biden is poorly positioned to counter Trump’s baseless charges about his son while at the same time answering concerns about why he allowed the perception of a conflict of interest.AD

Biden has vowed that his administration would not allow family members to conduct overseas business, a pledge meant to inoculate him from attacks but one that also raises questions about why he did not do more to prevent an appearance of conflict while he was vice president.When asked about that contradiction early in the debate, Biden did not directly respond.The United States has been at war in Iraq and Afghanistan since the early 2000s, and Biden was among those who voted to authorize the conflicts.But in a sign of Biden’s relatively drama-free night, his vote did not come up during the lengthy discussion of foreign policy.Biden called Trump an “erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy.”-- Biden often faded into the background.No one onstage wanted to criticize Hunter Biden’s foreign buckraking, fearing it would backfire and make them look like they were carrying water for Trump.“My son did nothing wrong,” Biden said.It’s why is it that everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?”

Biden jumped in: “No one is supporting billionaires!”

Criticizing her on health care specifically, Buttigieg suggested that Warren might be too divisive as president at a time when America needs a leader who can heal.But that pales in comparison to Biden, her main rival, who could talk about his extensive personal experience with Russia and Turkey.Toward the end of the debate, Biden declared that he’s the only one onstage who has accomplished anything significant legislatively.“I convinced people to vote for it,” Biden replied.Biden smiled.“On Tuesday, Sanders unveiled legislation with Omar to enact a universal school meals program.”

-- Another indicator that Biden is not a front-runner came in lackluster campaign finance filings released late last night: His campaign struggled to gain financial steam in the past three months — spending money at a faster clip and entering this month with a smaller campaign war chest than his leading competitors, Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy report.Biden’s share of small-dollar donations, a signal of enthusiasm, was also significantly lower.Warren had $25.7 million; Buttigieg had $23.4 million; Harris had $10.5 million; and Biden had just $9 million.His losers are Biden, Steyer, Booker’s attack on the moderator questions about Hunter Biden’s overseas work, as well as Biden’s answer to that question, and the question Warren still won’t answer: Whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would increase taxes for the middle class.He said Warren, Biden, Harris and Steyer lost.Biden and O’Rourke didn’t fare as well.Giuliani and the Hill had alleged earlier this year that Yovanovitch provided a ‘do not prosecute list’ to Ukrainian officials to protect the Bidens and other allies.‘This is not a game for us, this is deadly serious.’”

-- A Ukrainian oligarch wanted by U.S. law enforcement has been helping Giuliani attack Biden, according to Time magazine: “Close allies of the President have received key documents and information from [Dmitry Firtash], a Ukrainian oligarch wanted in the U.S. on corruption charges … [He] has spent the last five years in Vienna fighting extradition to the U.S. on bribery and racketeering charges.As part of his legal defense, Firtash’s lawyers have gathered documents that make controversial allegations against former special counsel Robert Mueller and [Biden].In his frequent appearances on cable news, Giuliani has presented some of these documents to the American public as evidence for his claims of wrongdoing by Mueller and Biden.@tebartl digs in: https://t.co/6GJb24pjmq — Megan Cassella (@mmcassella) October 15, 2019

The left’s feud is replicated in the center, where Biden faces challenges from Buttigieg, Klobuchar and others.“Biden has always been a fragile front-runner, and I don’t think you would call him the front-runner anymore.So if you are Buttigieg or Klobuchar, the most obvious play was to try to go after Biden supporters who seem more gettable now than they were six months ago.”

Biden on Wednesday also faced a striking problem for a former vice president with decades of Democratic connections: a lack of money.As he and others did during the debate, Biden questioned how she would pay for Medicare-for-all’s significant costs.“It’s fascinating that the person with a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,” Biden told reporters here before heading into a union hall in Columbus.AD

“I was surprised last night in the debate one of my colleagues said we should remove all troops from the Middle East,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event in Davenport, Iowa.“It’s a pretty rare thing to see in politics.”

He also pointed to filings released Tuesday that showed Warren had $25.7 million on hand at the end of September: “She’s talked one-on-one with more than 70,000 people and isn’t funding her campaign by charging $1,000 to schmooze and take photos with rich people behind closed doors.”

While Biden was aiming directly at a candidate who has met and sometimes exceeded him in recent polls, the strategy for Butigieg and Klobuchar was somewhat more nuanced: to try to persuade voters who may be leaning toward Biden that they are better positioned to articulate a path forward for the party, first against the liberal candidates, and then against Trump.The senator from Minnesota pitches herself as pragmatic and realistic; someone who, like Biden, can connect with white blue-collar voters, especially those in the Midwest.He has remained in the middle of the pack, lacking the opening that Biden’s stumbles could provide.Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar claim to represent a sensible Midwestern approach, but from a younger generation than Biden’s.Trump’s effort to prompt investigations of the Bidens is at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry.Joe Biden said he wouldn’t have changed anything about his actions, including discouraging his son from joining the board, and had no regrets.Perry said those qualms were related to fears Ukraine tried to sink Trump's candidacy in 2016, allegations that haven't been substantiated, and denied ever hearing anyone bring up former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Mr. Perry also said he never heard the president, any of his appointees, Mr. Giuliani or the Ukrainian regime discuss the possibility of specifically investigating [Joe Biden]....

“Biden on Wednesday also faced a striking problem for a former vice president with decades of Democratic connections: a lack of money....

“Biden and his allies also ramped up their criticism of an answer Warren gave during the debate in which she said, ‘I think we ought to get out of the Middle East.‘I was surprised last night in the debate one of my colleagues said we should remove all troops from the Middle East,’ Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event in Davenport, Iowa.They did not provide details on what 'other revenue options' the campaign is studying, and declined to comment on whether Warren may eventually put out her own details on paying for Medicare for All.”

-- A career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about then-Vice President Joe Biden’s son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer, according to three people familiar with the testimony.John Hudson, Rachael Bade and Matt Viser report: “George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden’s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest … Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father … But when Kent raised the issue with Biden’s office, he was told the then-vice president didn’t have the ‘bandwidth’ to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer…”

THE LATEST ON IMPEACHMENT:

-- Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted during a news conference that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid in part to pressure Ukraine to pursue an investigation that could benefit him politically — acknowledging a quid pro quo that is at the heart of an impeachment inquiry and that the president and his allies have vigorously denied for weeks.But that’s it, and that’s why we held up the money.’ Mulvaney denied that the aid was also contingent on a Ukrainian investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, or Biden’s son Hunter, another potential quid pro quo that congressional Democrats are looking into as part of the impeachment inquiry.”

“Later, after Trump’s lawyer and other Republicans distanced themselves from Mulvaney, the White House scrambled to walk back his comments, issuing an official statement blaming the media for misconstruing his words … ‘Let me be clear,’ Mulvaney’s written statement said, ‘there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.The biggest name not included in the Weather Channel special is Joe Biden.The former vice president won't participate because of scheduling issues with the network, according to a Biden campaign official.Biden did appear at the CNN town hall on climate change last month, where he was pointedly questioned by an activist about a fundraiser co-hosted by a businessman who helped start a natural gas company.and Joe Biden have criticized Facebook's recent decision to run a Trump campaign ad that made false claims about the former vice president's dealings with Ukraine.Even as Democrats investigate the president for impeachment, Trump's campaign has been able to use the scandal to its advantage, running a variety of ads experimenting with attacks on Biden, including one that made false allegations that the former vice president threatened to withhold foreign aid from Ukraine if it didn't end an investigation into his son.Biden, in contrast, has drastically dialed back his online advertising.Mr. Biden’s campaign put up the stiffest resistance: It demanded Facebook take down the ad, only to be rebuffed.in Iowa, according to a new Suffolk University/USA Today poll: “The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Biden at 18%, Warren at 17% and Buttigieg at 13% among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers.The poll also finds:

The biggest winners since the July Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll were Buttigieg (+7 points) and Warren (+4 points), while the biggest losers were Harris (-13 points) and Biden (-6 points).“Neither of those foreign leaders specifically encouraged Trump to see Ukraine as a potential source of damaging information about [Biden], nor did they describe Kyiv as complicit in an unsubstantiated 2016 election conspiracy theory … But their disparaging depictions of Ukraine reinforced Trump’s perceptions of the country and fed a dysfunctional dynamic in which White House officials struggled to persuade Trump to support the fledgling government in Kyiv instead of exploiting it for political purposes …

“The role played by Putin and Orban, a hard-right leader who has often allied himself with the Kremlin’s positions, was described in closed-door testimony last week by George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state … Kent cited the influence of those leaders as a factor that helped sour Trump on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the months leading up to their July 25 phone call … The efforts to poison Trump’s views toward Zelensky were anticipated by national security officials at the White House … But the voices of Putin and Orban took on added significance this year because of the departure or declining influence of those who had sought to blunt the influence of Putin and other authoritarian leaders over Trump.But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race — but could be lured in.” Here are some of the “white knights” that some Democratic leaders would like to see enter the contest at the last minute:

The 2020 presidential candidate’s plea came just hours after Facebook’s announcement that it pulled down a network of Russia-linked accounts criticizing Biden and praising President Trump.Biden's quick jump on fundraising shows it's not just tech companies that are in a position of relative strength since the last presidential election.Biden now has the opportunity to fight back — and maybe even win the messaging war — before the primary vote.One Russian account, which portrayed itself as a black voter in Michigan, used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to hammer Biden for gaffes about racial issues.Democrats have questioned Facebook's commitment to fighting election disinformation following the platform's decision to not fact-check politicians' ads -- especially those from President Trump, whom they accuse of spreading baseless claims against Biden and his son's dealings in Ukraine.Biden's campaign praised Facebook for the account takedowns but questioned Facebook's commitment to election integrity.“Unfortunately, like the Kremlin, Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, [and] all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform,” TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement to my colleagues.The Medicare payment debate could affect the primary in a number of ways, not least because Buttigieg, Joe Biden and some lower-polling center-left candidates have suggested that a “public option” would eventually get the country to full coverage — the same government coverage of health costs, but over a longer time frame.“So Biden and Buttigieg are either lying about how effective their public options will be, or they’re lying about how much they will ultimately cost." by Jonathan Martin

There haven't been many polls testing the vice president against the 2020 Democrats, but the impeachment drumbeat has prompted the question: Seriously, how would these candidates fare against Mike Pence?Both of them lead the president, Biden by five and Warren by three.That, too, is no guarantee of victory — in many polls, she still trails former vice president Joe Biden — but you definitely need it if you don’t have a lot of other cards to play.Bolton’s intervention came as the president was telling White House aides that any assistance for Ukraine depended upon Zelensky publicly stating that his government would investigate Hunter Biden’s role as a board member of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, according to congressional testimony this week by acting U.S. ambassador William B. Taylor Jr.

“The president doesn’t want to provide any assistance at all,” Taylor said Tim Morrison, the National Security Council’s top Russia official, told him Aug. 22.And Sept. 1, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and coordinator of the administration’s Ukraine policy, told Taylor that “everything” depended upon Zelensky saying publicly that he would investigate Joe Biden and allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, Taylor told the House impeachment inquiry Tuesday.About 1 in 5 said they’d be disappointed if it were Joe Biden or Sen.

(Meg Kinnard/AP)

Until Thursday, when Joe Biden's presidential campaign ended its opposition to a supportive super PAC, Biden convincingly explained why this would be a bad idea.In his 2017 memoir “Promise Me, Dad,” Biden revealed that he would have refused super PAC support had he run in the 2016 primary.They worried that the campaign was leaving money on the table by rejecting an independent PAC that could raise unlimited sums of money; the campaign stuck with Biden's position, that “middle class Joe” couldn't embrace that system.That's no longer Biden's position.The rationale from Biden's deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield was that President Trump “decided that the general election has already begun,” running millions of dollars in attack ads against Biden.Biden's action could fundamentally change the primary, testing whether Democratic panic about another Trump term has made them less interested in small-money purity.“I think he needed to do it,” said Bill Gluba, a former mayor of Davenport, Iowa, who supports Biden.There's some risk, sure, but Democrats will get over it.”

The early reaction has mirrored the response to Biden's previous high-profile position switch, when he abandoned his decades-long support for bans on government funding of abortion — a few days of eye-rolling before the news cycle turned to something else.“I am a candidate of the working class.”

Sanders, who turned his 2016 no-super-PAC stance into a major part of his identity despite benefiting from one allied with a nurses' union, unsurprisingly has said the most about Biden's shift.made a glancing reference to Biden in a tweet — “every Democratic candidate should agree: Super PACs have no place in our primary” — while former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), whose campaign fundraising has lagged behind his 2018 Senate effort, has begun to contrast his pledge with Biden's.It’s the right way of doing things, and the only way we can truly make sure we put power back into the hands of the people.”

Biden's rivals have made the bet that he was making until Thursday: Voters will reward candidates who don't appear to be working for big donors.“I’m not even sure Joe Biden knows what a Super PAC is, but there’s no doubt he needs a bailout,” said Brian O. Walsh, the president of America First Action PAC, the president's preferred outside group.“Maybe they can collect coupons to play ads on his record player.”

There are two reasons the Trump operation was able to abandon his old stance, and each reason carries a different lesson for Biden.It would spend $42 million on the primary alone, more than Biden has raised so far for his entire campaign.The super PAC's role in the primary was largely to attack and negatively define Romney's opponents, who — unlike Biden's — lagged behind him in every kind of fundraising.Brutally attack Mitt Romney, and hope Newt Gingrich is his opponent.” It made exactly the sort of argument Biden's donors want made now: that Trump has been attacking the former vice president because he's the Democrat who polls best against him.“Biden's, presumably, will.Still, I think voters are more concerned about reform once you're in office than how you get there.”

Clinton won the primary, but the lesson of 2016 was that accepting super PAC s could and would be used against candidates — exactly what Biden warned until this week.But the reason that Trump could flip and embrace super PACs is the second reason Biden could benefit.There's little demand to do so from Democratic voters, for the same reason that there was no lasting backlash from Biden's Hyde Amendment switch: Democrats want to win.Much as Obama did in 2012 and Clinton did in 2016, the Biden campaign has argued that no campaign finance change can happen so long as the party is out of power.“

Larry Lessig, an academic and activist who launched a super PAC and then a 2016 presidential campaign to demand campaign finance restructuring, said that Biden's approach to super PACs was less important that what he committed to do if he won in 2020.What mattered was not how Biden's allies raised money; it was whether he, or any other Democrat, pledged to replace the campaign money system with some kind public financing.We need to focus people on the real issue.”

Lucky for Lessig, Biden has endorsed a constitutional amendment that would ban all private money from elections, replacing it with public financing.Not much that was different; criminal justice restructuring has been a fairly robust part of the Democratic primary, with every major candidate proposing changes, and Biden at one point apologizing for the effects of some crime legislation he had helped write as a senator decades ago.DEBATE SEASON

This is exactly why many Democrats once saw Biden as their savior, since he combines a white working-class appeal with a strong draw on the loyalty of African Americans.Biden’s problem is that many Democrats have begun to wonder if the candidate they are seeing on the trail is the same person they imagined when he first announced his bid.AD

It was just a few days ago that Biden dropped his long-standing opposition to having a super PAC created to support him.In a Democratic Party increasingly skeptical of rich and powerful figures, Biden’s change has prompted other candidates to accuse him of hypocrisy.Organizers of the super PAC, including several former Biden staffers and aides, say the goal is to help him fend off attacks from President Trump, who has aimed much of his fire at the former vice president.“We are committed to fighting back against Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party — all of whom are engaged in unprecedented attacks against Vice President Biden in order to deny him the Democratic nomination,” Mark Doyle, the chairman of the super PAC and a former Biden aide, said in a statement.AD

Morrison had alerted NSC lawyers about alleged demands being placed on the Ukrainian government to investigate a company where the son of former Vice President Joe Biden sat on the board, according to testimony this month from William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine.Taylor testified that Morrison told him that Gordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union, had informed a top Ukrainian official that U.S. military aid hinged on Zelenskiy's committing to investigating the firm connected with Biden's son.“I think this is not something people want on their dinner table.”

A January trial also would disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before the Iowa caucuses for candidates who are senators in Washington, while others, including former vice president Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, continued to rally voters on the campaign trail.The Army officer, a recipient of the Purple Heart, recalled Zelensky specifically referencing the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma by name when Trump pushed him to investigate a company related to Joe Biden’s son Hunter.This is most likely a reference to comments Biden made last year that the United States iced $1 billion in loan guarantees until the Ukrainian government fired a corrupt former prosecutor, per Karoun Demirjian and Greg Jaffe.-- Vindman not only testified that the rough transcript omitted “crucial words and phrases,” according to the New York Times, but he also said that his efforts to update the record of the call to reflect Trump’s mentions of Burisma and Biden on tape failed: “Colonel Vindman did not testify to a motive behind the White House editing process … but the decision by a White House lawyer to quickly lock down the reconstructed transcript subverted the normal process of handling such documents …The note-takers and voice recognition software used during the July 25 call had missed Mr. Zelensky saying the word ‘Burisma,’ according to people briefed on the matter, but the reconstructed transcript does refer to ‘the company,’ and suggests that the Ukrainian president is aware that it is of great interest to Mr. Trump.Colonel Vindman told investigators that at the point of the transcript where the third set of ellipses appears, Mr. Trump said there were tapes of Mr. Biden.’”

NBC, the AP and BuzzFeed reported that they confirmed various elements of the Times reporting, including that Vindman tried to change the transcript to no avail.… After seeing Sondland outline political demands that Trump would reiterate in his July 25 call, Vindman said, he became worried that what he had witnessed was improper …

“Sondland has testified that he didn’t know of any Biden connection in Trump’s demands for a Burisma investigation until much later, after the allegations in the whistleblower complaint became known.“Vindman said that Sondland used the downstairs meeting to press for ‘investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma.’ Vindman said he then confronted Sondland, saying that ‘his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the [National Security Council] was going to get involved in or push.’” (The Fix created a Trump-Ukraine timeline to help keep straight what we’ve learned.)Biden stands slightly behind at 15 percent, while Pete Buttigieg is the final candidate to reach double digits with 10 percent.-- Biden’s cash-strapped campaign is talking to top donors about ways to beef up fundraising in the next quarter.Yet several of Biden’s fundraisers believe that the campaign needs to improve its appeal to online donors.… Biden’s campaign has been behind in spending on Facebook ads that often entice contributors.Since he entered the race in April, Biden has spent $2.5 million on Facebook."Our campaign would be extremely frustrated if the super PAC was used to attack other Democrats," Biden's campaign manager Greg Schultz told reporters Tuesday, per CBS News.In The Post’s survey, she took these other positions on K-12 education:

AD

She supports free prekindergarten programs for low-income families; Sanders and Biden support free pre-K for all.She said federal courts or agencies should be more aggressive in encouraging or pressuring school districts to desegregate their schools; so did Sanders and Biden.Biden did not provide a response.Biden has proposed his own K-12 education plan, which is less detailed but also includes more spending for schools in high-poverty districts.Third, he is doing what every other non-Biden candidate has failed to do: He is standing firm in the center left.AD

The conventional wisdom has been that Biden has to collapse before someone can move up in the not-too-far-left category of candidates.However, Biden might not disintegrate, and in fact, the loyalty of African Americans suggests that he will maintain a solid base of support at least until the early primaries.However, it is entirely possible that Buttigieg, without attacking Biden (in fact, he has smartly defended Biden against Trump’s scurrilous attacks), can impress debate-watchers and early state caucus and primary voters to pull him even with better-known candidates who should be able to clobber a mayor of a medium-size Midwestern city.Many civil liberties advocates view Snowden as a famous precursor to the anonymous individual who filed a detailed report with the intelligence community's inspector general alleging Trump inappropriately asked the Ukranian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son.AD

Most notable, said Edelson, the NYU researcher, is the absence of impeachment ads from former vice president Joe Biden.“On the Democratic side, the natural respondent here would be Joe Biden,” Edelson said.In the controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump repeatedly urged Zelensky to investigate Biden and son Hunter Biden, according to the rough transcript released by the White House.AD

But Biden hasn’t fully backed impeachment, saying only that Trump must comply with congressional oversight.“Since President Trump’s debunked attacks, there’s been a groundswell of grass-roots support for Vice President Biden because Democrats know Biden is the best candidate to take back the White House and undo the damage that President Trump has done to our democracy,” said Michael Gwin, Biden’s deputy director of rapid response.According to the campaign, the week ending Sept. 30 was one of Biden’s best online fundraising weeks.“Now that we know Donald Trump is willing to throw every trick in the book at me, it’s never been more important we hit this goal,” Biden said in a fundraising plea this week.He says his call with Ukraine’s leader was “perfect” and the Biden family is “corrupt.” “I don’t care,” he says, when asked whether the whistleblower should be allowed to remain anonymous, as indicated by law.1:40 p.m. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is asked at a Las Vegas event whether he would allow his vice president’s children to serve on a foreign company’s board, as Hunter Biden did during the Obama presidency.“The whole thing is a scam.”

2:55 p.m. Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asks the central question of the impeachment scandal: “Can you just make clear right here what do you or what did you want President Zelensky to do with regard to Joe and Hunter Biden?” Trump gives an extended answer about his frustration about European financial support for Ukraine and corruption in the country.After Trump finishes, another reporter asks him to answer the original question about Biden.“Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked,” Trump says.“The question was, sir, what did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son Hunter?” Trump is unhappy with this follow-up.Ask him a question.” Mason calmly repeats the question again for Trump about Biden.The article says people close to Pence insist he was unaware of Trump’s urging Zelensky to find damaging information about the Bidens.Our colleagues Rosalind S. Helderman, Tom Hamburger, Paul Sonne and Josh Dawsey report this morning that House investigators are seeking information about a handful of Giuliani's clients — some of whom assisted Trump's personal lawyer in his sleuthing mission to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.The men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , have been assisting Giuliani’s push to get Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son and Giuliani’s claim that Democrats conspired with Ukrainians in the 2016 campaign.”

Questions remain: Giuliani "told The Post he has had no clients in Ukraine since 2017 but wouldn't disclose whether he is being paid Parnas and Fruman, emigres from the former Soviet Union."The House committees have asked them to turn over all documents and communications related to the donations.”

Notable: Two days before the contribution to America First, “in May 2018, about six months before the men began working with Giuliani on his Biden investigation, a Florida business established by Parnas received a $1.26 million wire transfer from an account whose owner was represented by a real estate lawyer who specializes in assisting foreign buyers of U.S. property, court documents and corporate filings show.”

FEC complaint: “Last year, the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center filed a still-pending complaint with the Federal Election Commission over the donation, alleging that it appeared to be a straw donation that masked the identity of the original contributor.” More: “Parnas told the Miami Herald last week that the money for the super PAC donation was from proceeds from the sale of a Miami-area condominium.When President Donald Trump suggested — without prompting — that China should investigate Joe Biden and his son, he thrust another political grudge into what was already the world's most complicated and consequential relationship.Thursday's comments weren't the first time Trump has injected Biden into his relationship with China, though he said Thursday he has never pushed Xi to investigate the former vice president.On Wednesday, Biden finally responded in a Reno, Nev., speech with a full-throated attack on Trump.Biden declared: “It’s not about Donald Trump’s antics.What has brought us here is simply this: the abuse of power.” Putting Trump’s private interests above the country’s, Biden argued, is what Trump’s presidency is all about.Biden would do well to keep repeating this message.First, Biden should make clear Trump is once again taking Russian President Vladimir Putin’s side against the United States.Biden should say so, arguing that this makes Trump dangerously unfit for the presidency.Third, Biden would do well to emphasize that Trump did not hire the best people.Biden should make clear that anyone who participated in an illegal conspiracy and coverup will be held accountable to the extent the facts and law warrant.Biden might want to suggest that all government employees with information relevant to the impeachment inquiry step forward now, for the sake of the country and their own careers.In sum, Biden took a good first step with his Wednesday speech, but he now must lean into attacks on Trump’s abuse of power and attendant clueless foreign policy (spoon-fed to him by Putin) and crony-filled administration.Offering himself as the candidate whom Trump is most scared of and who is best-equipped to undo the damage Trump has wrought might be just the message Biden needs to regain momentum.Trump’s plea to China for an investigation into the Bidens came almost immediately after he addressed his acrimonious trade war with China.“I have a lot of options on China,” Trump warned, “but if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous power.”

When a reporter then asked what he had hoped Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would do following their July 25 phone call, Trump replied: “If they were honest about it, they’d start a major investigation into the Bidens.They should investigate the Bidens.”

Trump’s remarks underscored his claim that he did nothing improper by calling on a foreign power to investigate a domestic political opponent, a move his critics consider an egregious violation of his constitutional oath.Hunter Biden joined the board of an investment advisory firm whose partners included Chinese entities shortly after visiting China in 2013 with his father while he was vice president.George Mesires, an attorney representing Hunter Biden, has said that his client acquired a 10 percent equity stake in the firm in October 2017, and as of this summer that stake was worth about $430,000.Following the nearly 10-hour deposition, House investigators released text messages provided by Volker illustrating how at Trump’s behest, senior State Department officials coordinated with a Ukrainian official and Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to leverage a summit between the two heads of state on the Ukrainian president’s promise to investigate the 2016 election and an energy company that employed Hunter Biden.Giuliani complained in a recent interview with The Washington Post that Yovanovitch obstructed efforts to persuade the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens.The muted response from GOP lawmakers about Trump’s call for China to investigate Biden presented a stark contrast to earlier this week, when many spoke out after the president tweeted congratulations to Chinese President Xi Jinping in celebration of the 70th anniversary of communist rule in Beijing.Minutes after Trump called on China to investigate Biden, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tweeted a link to a letter he sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that morning asking her to suspend the impeachment inquiry until she answers questions about the process.I think he’s now decided that the only way he can survive this is to do what he has been doing in secret in a very public way in order to normalize it.”

AD

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), usually one of the president’s loyal defenders, said in an interview Thursday that he did not agree with the call for China to investigate the Biden family.Asked about Trump’s call for China to investigate the Bidens, the vice president told reporters, “I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president in the last administration.”

Pence had a different position in 2016 when he was running for vice president.The key: The texts revealed officials on both sides understood Trump would not agree to a summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky unless there was a public promise to investigate the 2016 election and an energy company that employed Joe Biden's son.Today's going to be dramatic: “Though the texts do not mention Biden by name, congressional Democrats leading an impeachment inquiry are pointing to them as clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing 'to launch politically motivated investigations,' top Democrats said in statement Thursday night,” our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey and John Hudson report.Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, sat on the board of Burisma for five years.” But Trump never committed to a meeting.Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, sat on the board of Burisma for five years.” But Trump never committed to a meeting.But if they had, Mr. Trump’s aides would have effectively pressured a foreign government to give credence to allegations intended to undercut one of the Democratic Party’s leading 2020 presidential candidates — [Biden]— without leaving Mr. Trump’s fingerprints on it.”

Rudy reacts: Giuliani told Power Up late last night after reviewing the texts between diplomats that “it's clear that the presidents intentions are clearly no quid pro quo."The Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus, Michael Bender, and Vivian Salama scooped that Trump himself ordered Yovanovitch's removal as the ambassador of Ukraine “after months of complaints from allies outside the administration, including his personal lawyer [Giuliani], that she was undermining him abroad and obstructing efforts to persuade Kyiv to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, according to people familiar with the matter.”

TRUMP ASKS CHINA TO INVESTIGATE BIDENS: Trump's brazen request to China to investigate his 2020 challenger yesterday "seemed to make a mockery of the charge that he abused the power of his office by pressing his Ukrainian counterpart to examine unfounded allegations of corruption by Biden and his son Hunter," our colleagues Philip Rucker, Rachael Bade and Colby Itkowitz report.The timing was curious at best: “Trump’s plea to China for an investigation into the Bidens came almost immediately after he addressed his acrimonious trade war with China,” our colleagues write.“I have a lot of options on China,” Trump warned, “but if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous power.”

“Trump’s plea to China for an investigation into the Bidens came almost immediately after he addressed his acrimonious trade war with China,” our colleagues write.“If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that’s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.”

“Hold up: Americans don’t look to Chinese commits for the truth,” Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.)“If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that’s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.” And the chair of the Federal Election Commission just seemed exasperated:

Is this thing on?The biggest news from the messages is that senior State Department officials coordinated with the Ukrainian president’s top aide and Trump’s personal lawyer to leverage a potential summit between the heads of state on a promise from the Ukrainians to publicly announce they would investigate the 2016 U.S. election and an energy company that employed the son of 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden.-- More news from the testimony: “Volker told House investigators on Thursday that he had warned Giuliani against trusting the information he was receiving from Ukrainian political figures about Joe Biden and his son,” per Karoun Demirjian, Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey and John Hudson.‘I’m pretty certain he never said that the claims weren’t true, because I would have jumped all over him and asked him what kind of investigation he’d done and how he knew that,’ Giuliani said of Volker.”

-- Trump ordered the removal of Marie Yovanovitch as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine after months of complaints from Giuliani that she was blocking efforts to investigate Biden.In an interview, Mr. Giuliani told The Wall Street Journal that in the lead-up to Ms. Yovanovitch’s removal, he reminded the president of complaints percolating among Trump supporters that she had displayed an anti-Trump bias in private conversations.”

-- Giuliani said State Department officials told him they would investigate after he gave Pompeo a trove of documents with unproven allegations against Biden.It does not protect any conversation Giuliani may have had with the president of Ukraine or any other foreign official, even if Trump was on the phone.”

TRUMP'S APPEAL TO CHINA:

-- The president publicly urged China to investigate Biden.Philip Rucker, Rachael Bade and Colby Itkowtiz report: “With his brazen and direct appeal to the Chinese, delivered before journalists assembled on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump seemed to make a mockery of the charge that he abused the power of his office by pressing his Ukrainian counterpart to examine unfounded allegations of corruption by Biden and his son Hunter.Trump’s plea to China for an investigation into the Bidens came almost immediately after he addressed his acrimonious trade war with China.‘I have a lot of options on China,’ Trump warned, ‘but if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous power.’ … ‘China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened in Ukraine.’ …

“Trump’s statement about China effectively globalizes the argument he has been making domestically, calling on other countries to stand with the United States under his rule or against it.Asked earlier this week about Trump's call with Xi, the White House did not deny that he raised Biden.Hannah Knowles reports: “CNN’s move brought renewed ire from Trump’s reelection campaign, as Communications Director Tim Murtaugh called the news network a ‘Democrat public relations firm’ that ‘spends all day protecting [Biden].’ The first rejected ad ... claims Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor looking into ‘his son’s company.’ … No evidence indicates Biden sought to help his son … [The second ad] depicts prominent journalists bashed by Trump: CNN hosts Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo, CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.""If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that’s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps."-- On the other hand, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) actually said he’s okay with Trump asking China to investigate Biden.-- Speaking of rank hypocrisy, an unearthed letter from 2016 shows that Johnson was one of the Republican senators pushing for the same changes to Ukraine’s prosecutor general's office as Biden that Trump now calls corrupt.However, no evidence has emerged that Perry participated in the effort to pressure Ukranian officials to investigate [the Bidens].… Trump’s campaign mocked Biden’s fundraising haul Thursday evening.We did that in 3 days,’ the campaign said in a tweet sent from its official account.”

-- Trump is preparing an avalanche of TV ads targeting Biden in early primary states.From Politico: “Starting this weekend, the reelection effort will air over $1 million in anti-Biden commercials in Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada, according to two people familiar with the move.… The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Biden, to counter Trump's Ukraine attacks, is planning his own $6 million ad campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.”

-- The Democratic National Committee’s low-key role in responding to the recent Trump scandals is sparking a growing sense of frustration among DNC insiders that the party is not up to the task.From Politico: “There are complaints that the national party isn’t delivering a digital counter-punch, that it’s getting swamped by Republican fundraising, and doing little to combat an onslaught of incoming TV ads targeting Biden on Ukraine.https://t.co/ykGifvp4JA — John Sipher (@john_sipher) October 3, 2019

QUOTE OF THE DAY: “Someone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count,” Hillary Clinton tweeted after Trump asked China to investigate Joe Biden.“He did not condition any U.S. support on a Biden investigation.Yet Carlson and Patel opened their op-ed with this admission: “Donald Trump should not have been on the phone with a foreign head of state encouraging another country to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden,” wrote the authors.“But instead of trying to fix any of that, Democrats want to spend the next year explaining — and they plan to — explaining why it was perfectly fair for Joe Biden’s ne’er-do-well son to get 600 grand a year from Ukrainian oligarchs.Former vice president Joe Biden, who leads most polls for the Democratic nod, embraced the notion of a Green New Deal in June when he released his climate plan.Biden has promised to create more than 10 million well-paying jobs while putting the country on track for net-zero emissions at 2050 at the latest.But Perry told CBN News that the Biden family was not brought up in discussions with Ukrainian officials: “Not once, as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name — not the former vice president, not his son — ever mentioned.”

Perry said he “absolutely” asked Trump to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but both he and an aide say the push was to talk about energy and economic issues.But Perry told CBN News that the Biden family was not brought up in discussions with Ukrainian officials: “Not once, as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name — not the former vice president, not his son — ever mentioned.” What Trump ended up doing: According to a rough transcript of the July 25 phone call, the president ended up asking “a favor” that included requests to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.According to a rough transcript of the July 25 phone call, the president ended up asking “a favor” that included requests to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.“But Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, or a U.S. holdup in military aid to the country,” AP reports.The plan included input from Biden’s wife, Jill, who has spent her career as an educator and who still teaches at Northern Virginia Community College, where she also worked when Biden served as vice president.AD

“I’ve seen so many lives changed by community colleges and technical training, especially in underserved places,” Jill Biden told reporters on a conference call to preview the plan.The ability to get child care, so that they can come to class; affordable housing options; and the transportation they need to get to school.”

Biden’s plan would make two years of community college tuition-free.Biden would also invest $70 billion in schools aimed at educating minorities, including historically black colleges and universities and tribal colleges and universities.Biden would pay for the $750 billion plan by eliminating a complex tax provision called “stepped-up basis,” which adjusts the value of inherited assets in a way that allows heirs to avoid paying taxes on any appreciation in value the asset accrued during the decedent’s lifetime.Biden would also cap at 28 percent the itemized deductions the wealthiest Americans can take.AD

The plan comes at a tenuous moment for Biden, as his campaign teeters in its response to President Trump — who has ridiculed Biden and his son Hunter for the son’s pursuit of overseas business while his father was vice president — and in trying to keep up with the far-reaching plans that his Democratic primary rivals have been releasing.AD

Biden over the past two weeks has attempted to promote his ideas on health care and gun control, even as Trump has released TV ads attacking him as corrupt and has aired unfounded accusations that have become a centerpiece of the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats.Many of Biden’s education proposals put him in line with his Democratic primary rivals — although in some cases their plans have gone further.Biden takes aim at the same problem, with a proposal to help low-income Americans pay off their education loans.Biden would also create a program to provide $10,000 in undergraduate or graduate student debt relief for every year of national or community service, up to five years.That is, while the impeachment push launched over pressure the president put on his Ukrainian counterpart to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Trump himself broadened its scope when, live on national television last week, he urged China to join the effort.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) deflected a question about Trump’s call for China to investigate the Bidens by arguing the president had been kidding (he didn't appear to be; here's the video).But the president refused to answer questions about whether he was joking:

"The President refused to answer repeated questions about whether he was serious or joking about asking China to investigate the Bidens," per pool report from cabinet meeting.The official described the call as “crazy,” “frightening” and “completely lacking in substance related to national security.” The official asserted that the President used the call to persuade Ukrainian authorities to investigate his political rivals, chiefly former Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter.Biden, meanwhile, has been hovering in the upper 20s since July, after spiking following his campaign announcement.Biden would certainly like to think that he’s Romney in this scenario, briefly giving up a lead that he’ll finish with.It was during that call that Trump repeatedly urged Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, according to a rough transcript of the call the White House released.U.S.A.!”

The third and most aggressive attempt by Biden to turn the administration's own attacks against it.2020

The impeachment inquiry continued to shape the Democrats' primary this week, as Joe Biden made his third major speech about the origins of that inquiry — the president urging Ukraine's president to investigate Biden's son and his business in the country.(There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.)Biden's first speech, delivered two weeks ago in Wilmington, Del., was brief; his second, delivered last week in Reno, Nev., furthered a new refrain that the president feared Biden would “beat him like a drum.”

Wednesday's speech, in Rochester, N.H., made news for the candidate's own evolution: For the first time, he called on the House to impeach the president.“He has no sense of decency,” Biden said.We have to prove him wrong.” Biden also won the official endorsement of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who had been speaking positively about his candidacy all year.On Thursday afternoon, Biden will join most of the rest of the Democratic field for LGBT-focused town halls in Los Angeles, hosted and moderated by CNN.Former vice president Joe Biden.Facebook declined the Biden camp's request to remove a Trump campaign ad that accused the former vice president of offering Ukraine $1 billion in aid, if the country pushed out the official investigating a company with ties to his son.And for its part, CNN refused to air the ad with misleading claims about Biden (which also called the network's own anchors "media lapdogs") because it did not meet its advertising standards.Facebook's decision about the Biden ad is under increased scrutiny after the company wrote a blog post in recent weeks where it committed to take a hands-off approach to politicians' content.As for the obstruction of Congress, expressed in an amateurish, angry letter from the White House counsel refusing to cooperate with congressional oversight and inquiry into impeachment, Biden said, “By obstructing justice and refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry, he’s already convicted himself.To preserve our Constitution, our democracy and our basic integrity, he should be impeached.”

Biden made a key point, rebutting the nonsensical argument that we should just leave him in office for more than a year to commit more constitutional mayhem.“He believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs,” Biden explained.He believes if he does something, it’s legal.” Biden argued that Trump “believes there is nothing we can do about it.Each and every candidate should refuse to entertain questions accusing Biden or his son of wrongdoing.Vice President Mike Pence, in Iowa to promote the trade pact, found himself swamped by questions about his involvement in pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his predecessor Joe Biden.2 insisted he “never discussed the issue of the Bidens with President Zelenskiy.”

The Campaign

THREADING THE NEEDLE: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez doubled down on the committee's decision not to directly counter Republican attacks on former vice president Joe Biden, arguing that its role is not to be any individual candidate's defender.As the Trump campaign runs ads that promulgate unsubstantiated accusations about Biden and his son's dealings in Ukraine, Perez said: “What we are doing forcefully — and will continue to do forcefully — is to call out misinformation and make sure networks aren’t aiding and abetting in the dissemination of misinformation.At the same time, the DNC chair has been pressed to take a stand as Trump’s push to foreign leaders to investigate Biden sparked an impeachment inquiry in the House — and spawned a crop of misleading counterattacks, in particular an ad currently running on social media and broadcast networks that the Biden campaign claims “spreads false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories.”

Intraparty tensions between Biden's camp and committee staffers were first reported last week by the New York Times: “The strain grew so acute that some of Mr. Biden’s advisers lashed out at their own party, taking the unusual step of urging campaign surrogates to criticize the [DNC] for not doing more to defend Mr. Biden,” Jonathan Martin, Alexander Burns and Katie Glueck reported.A compromise: The DNC has called for Facebook and networks to refuse to carry the 30-second ad called “Biden Corruption," which alleges without evidence that Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor looking a Ukraine gas company to protect his son Hunter Biden and accuses “media lap dogs” of helping Democrats with their impeachment push.Perez, however, insisted that the narrative Trump and his allies are pushing will not hurt Biden going into 2020.For instance, the committees recently launched $10 million ad offense targeting Democrats, including [Biden].”

“Trump’s overflowing coffers have allowed him to spend lavishly early in the race.For instance, the committees recently launched $10 million ad offense targeting Democrats, including [Biden].” $$$: “There are six main committees working to secure his second term, including the official campaign, the Republican National Committee and a super PAC.At The White House

THE ATTACKS CONTINUED AT A RAUCOUS MINNEAPOLIS RALLY: Trump “leveled some of his most personal attacks yet against Joe Biden and his family at his first campaign rally since House Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry, highlighting unsubstantiated claims about his potential 2020 rival’s son and using profanity to describe Biden’s tenure as vice president,” our colleagues Seung Min Kim and Aaron Blake report.On blast: Biden “was never considered smart,” Trump said.He was only a good vice president because he figured out how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass.”

-- Hunter Biden will resign from the board of a Chinese investment company by the end of this month and promises not to do any work for foreign firms if his father is elected president, his lawyer George Mesires said in a statement on Sunday.Michael Kranish and Anna Fifield report: “Mesires did not say how much Hunter Biden earned in his work for Burisma [in Ukraine].Mesires said Hunter Biden was paid nothing for his service as a director for the Chinese company and has yet to make a profit from his 2017 purchase of a 10 percent stake in that company, which he said is worth $430,000....

“Much about Hunter Biden’s China dealings is unknown because many records of the company are not public, and he has declined interview requests to discuss his work for the company.At the time, Archer was a partner in an investment company with Hunter Biden … In 2012, Li visited Archer in New York City to find a suitable investment partner.… It’s not clear whether Hunter Biden did anything other than provide a high-profile name — and a connection to the vice president of the United States — that might lure investors.…

-- Joe Biden, speaking on Sunday afternoon to reporters in Iowa, said he did not see the statement from his son’s attorney before it was released, but he said he supports it.A strong performance could help calm the doubts about his prospects as the oldest candidate in the field, while a weak showing could deal a devastating blow to a campaign that was already slipping.”

-- Warren continues to rise across the early states, drawing even with Biden and Sanders in Iowa, according to a CBS News battlegrounds poll.Meanwhile, voters have said Biden’s response to Trump’s accusations has left them “somewhat” satisfied, not “very” satisfied.If you prefer state by state polls, Warren leads Biden narrowly in Iowa and New Hampshire, then comes Sanders, with Buttigieg moving up.Biden leads by a huge amount in South Carolina.AD

Biden has not lost as much ground as one might imagine under the constant pummeling of President Trump and some media-driven moral equivalence between his son Hunter and the self-enriching Trump clan.Biden is not crashing, but he could make far better use of the impeachment proceedings.One wonders why Hunter Biden is going on television Tuesday.(Isn’t the point of Joe Biden’s argument that this is about Trump and his corruption, not Hunter Biden?)He has yet to make hay out of Trump’s obvious fear of going up against Biden or of his advantage on foreign policy.While voters do not prioritize foreign policy in debates, Biden would do well to yank the debate back to ground on which he has an advantage and offer himself as the one to pick up the pieces of America’s shattered reputation overseas.AD

How to cover the cost of Medicare-for-all has dominated the Democratic debates.AD

To illustrate the cost, Biden said that eliminating the U.S. defense budget would pay for four months of Medicare-for-all.The Biden camp said he took the Defense Department budget request for 2020, $718 billion, to come up with that estimate.His new attempt at a fiery persona comes as former vice president Joe Biden dips a bit in the polls.Buttigieg has long sided with Biden’s more moderate views on health care and economics, and his campaign is almost certainly calculating that if Biden gets out of the race, Buttigieg could attract some of his supporters.The big difference: Russia’s electoral interference is gaining new relevance as House Democrats pursue impeachment for Trump seemingly inviting Ukraine to find dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his family -- another case of a foreign power interfering in a U.S. election.Biden lambasted him for siding with Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies while Sen.

This seems to be his strongest suit: “I’m not going to lie to you, and I’m looking for workable solutions to your problems.” That is a message he needs to keep hitting even though he is more likely to pick up votes from supporters of former vice president Joe Biden.Why not attack Biden?For one thing, Buttigieg is trying to ingratiate himself with Biden voters (and not beat up on a sympathetic figure in the party) and for another, Buttigieg is betting that a side-by-side comparison between a sometimes meandering, older candidate and a verbally dexterous, young candidate will speak for itself.I am electable, and I’m a heck of a better candidate than Biden.And the tech titan doubled down on his stand that the company would not fact check political ads, despite a recent uproar about its decision to allow the Trump campaign to continue to run misleading ads about former vice president Joe Biden.“Facebook has chosen to sell Americans’ personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,” Bill Russo, spokesman for Biden for President, told my colleague Tony Romm in a statement.But recent polls have shown him trailing Warren and Biden.Some of them are eager to see him sharpen the contrast that he has drawn with Biden and hear him speak more openly about his personal life, including his heart attack.Former vice president Joe Biden’s education plan is less detailed but includes more spending for schools in high-poverty districts.“This is where much of the action in her Administration would be.” Bianchi was director of economic and domestic policy for ex-vice president Joe Biden, who is running for president in 2020; and Tedeschi served as a senior adviser and economist at the Treasury Department during the Obama administration.He’s down seven points to former vice president Joe Biden in RealClearPolitics’ average of national polls, and trails Sens.Biden, for example, has ranged from 47 to 57 percent against Trump, while Trump has only ranged from 38 to 45 percent.I just want to help solve the problems of this era.”

Without divulging which other candidate with whom he is most closely aligned, Yang claimed, of all the Democratic presidential hopefuls, only former vice president Joe Biden had pulled him aside to talk about concerns over automation and the “fourth industrial revolution.”

“I’m definitely open to working with Joe,” Yang said in response to a question about whether he’d serve as Biden’s vice president.Moderate candidates (e.g., former vice president Joe Biden, Sen.

Her ideas about the Middle East were criticized by her rival, former vice president Joe Biden, who suggested they are naive.“I have never heard anyone say with any serious background in foreign policy, ‘Pull all troops out of the Middle East,'” Biden told reporters in Ohio on Wednesday.AD

Turning to Biden specifically, the latest CNN poll, showing him leading with 34 percent, may be an outlier, so it will be necessary to await further polling.Overall Biden’s lead in the RealClearPolitics average over Warren has expanded as Warren has dropped a couple of points this month.Unlike Warren, who expressed support for bringing home all the troops (at least the combat ones), Biden sounds a more mature and balanced tone.The Associated Press reported:

Biden used a 40-minute speech in Iowa to excoriate Trump for withdrawing American forces and leaving Syrian Kurds, key U.S. allies in the yearslong fight against the Islamic State group, open to attacks from Turkey.Trump’s many foreign policy missteps make Biden’s experience as vice president and Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman an even more valuable asset.(“ ‘There’s not going to be time to build relationships from scratch,’ [Biden] said, adding that he can ‘pick up the phone, call our NATO allies, know them by their first name.’ ”)

This echoed his performance in the debate last Tuesday.The debate has escalated as 2020 Democrats attack the company for running a Trump campaign ad with misleading information about Biden's dealings with Ukraine.The result is that both Biden and Warren are leading Trump among women overall in these battlegrounds by 56-37 and 54-36 respectively.AD

One interesting point about this is that Biden doesn’t do appreciably better than Warren does among these subgroups of men, which is a bit of a surprise.In Quinnipiac University’s new poll, Biden wasn’t doing quite as well.CNN and polling partner SSRS had Biden scooping up 34 percent of the vote among possible primary voters; Quinnipiac had him at 21 percent.AD

AD

Before we try to answer that question, we’ll note that the difference between Biden and Warren in the two polls was represented across a range of demographic groups.Quinnpiac had Biden up three points with men and down 11 with women; CNN had Biden up 19 with men and 13 with women.Meaning that the top-line numbers (the 34 percent that CNN had for Biden, for example) really sit in the middle of a range of possibilities (something like 28 to 40 percent in the Biden example).AD

But we can’t say the same of the Biden results.Our average (which includes both the Quinnipiac and CNN polls) has Warren performing about as well as Quinnipiac’s poll but Biden somewhere in the middle of the two new results.CNN’s poll shows Biden doing better than the average, while Quinnipiac’s shows a downward turn that matches the average.and former vice president Joe Biden.Biden’s plan advocates legalizing marijuana for medical purposes but would leave decisions on recreational use largely up to the states.Biden would reclassify cannabis as a Schedule II drug, rather than Schedule I, so researchers would be allowed to study it.“As president, Joe Biden will push to remove private money from our federal elections.“Until we have these badly needed reforms, we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to re-elect this corrupt president.”

Biden has struggled to raise money, and last week, his campaign reported having $9 million on hand, roughly a third as much as some of his top Democratic rivals.In the statement released Thursday, the Biden campaign emphasized the challenge of facing Trump.“He and his allies are already spending [a] massive amount of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.”

That doesn’t mean that Biden could just turn off one spigot and expect the money to flow in equal measure from another.Right now it appears that Biden’s support is as broad as theirs, but not nearly as deep; he has millions of Democrats who will tell a pollster he’s their choice, but they aren’t so jazzed about him that they’re opening up their wallets.More money is always better than less money, of course, but in the primaries it’s hard to imagine that whatever problems Biden has can be solved with a bunch of ads being dropped on TV in Des Moines or on Facebook (since super PACs can’t coordinate directly with candidates, they usually dump most of their money on ineffectual advertising).AD

If instead he’s looking forward to the general election, that could be a different story, provided that the pro-Biden super PAC spent its money wisely, which is never a guarantee.AD

As far as campaign sins go, accepting the help of a super PAC is pretty minor, and I don’t doubt that Biden would sincerely prefer a system in which they didn’t exist.This idea — backed by several of the presidential candidates, including former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) — is something Congress tried to add to the ACA but was forced to ultimately remove.Biden, 76, and Warren, 70, have also faced questions about their age, but the subject is showing signs of becoming a larger concern for Sanders, especially since his heart attack.White House trade czar Peter Navarro refused in an interview with CNN’s Jim Sciutto to say whether U.S. negotiators discussed a potential Chinese investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son — an action Trump encouraged before national television cameras from the South Lawn.See Navarro here:

“It’s like dealing not with a commander in chief, but a whiner in chief,” said Biden.AD

Obama administration officials always made clear the United States was not in Iraq to steal the country’s oil, Biden said, because that’s exactly what the terrorists allege in their propaganda.Biden said there’s a middle ground between committing hundreds of thousands of troops to overly ambitious interventions and deploying the military for limited missions to lead coalitions and help local partners fight common enemies.AD

Joe Biden has a go-to line when asked about what he wants to do about climate change as president.That dynamic was on display Sunday evening when a volunteer for the youth climate group Sunrise Movement confronted Biden in North Carolina about why he decided to no longer oppose the creation of an outside group capable of taking unlimited donations in support of his candidacy.The decision to open the door to super PAC money has exposed Biden to criticism he will be beholden to wealthy donors.“Look at my record, child,” Biden responded.The Sunrise Movement, which has pushed the sweeping Green New Deal climate plan, later admonished Biden for responding to the 18-year-old activist with “frustrated condescension.” "It's one thing to say 'look at my record,' ' said Stephen O'Hanlon, a co-founder and spokesman for the Sunrise Movement.Biden did embrace the idea of a Green New Deal, which calls for rapidly reducing the nation's contributions to climate change, when he released his climate plan in June.Lily asked @JoeBiden how young people can trust he'll fight for us when he's opened the door SuperPACs, which would allow any amount of dark fossil fuel money to support his campaign.🙄 pic.twitter.com/NmpX2B1jUq — Sunrise Movement 🌅 (@sunrisemvmt) October 28, 2019

This isn't the first time Biden, a veteran senator from Delaware before serving two terms as President's Obama's No.“I’m one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill, way, way back in '87,” Biden said in Iowa in May.Biden indeed was among the first senators to introduce climate change legislation.Fact-checkers at PolitiFact and the New York Times both rated Biden's claim favorably.During his 36-year career in the Senate, Biden had an overall score of 83 percent from the League of Conservation Voters, which rates legislators on how they vote on various environmental issues, including climate change.Tiernan Sittenfeld, LCV's senior vice president for government affairs, said that many of the votes that counted against Biden's score reflect his occasional absence from the Senate — either during his previous runs for president in 1988 or 2008 or during his hospitalization for an aneurysm and other issues also in 1988.When serving as the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee through most of the 2000s, Biden criticized the George W. Bush administration for abandoning an international climate treaty called the Kyoto Protocol.We don't care what you do on your own,' “ Biden told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in 2001.Reengaging the rest of the world on reducing greenhouse gas is one of the planks of Biden's $1.7 trillion climate plan in the 2020 race.Biden calls for rejoining the Paris climate accord and legally committing the country to achieving net-zero emissions by at least 2050, though like many other Democrats he isn't precise how that to accomplish that goal.At times, Biden has taken environmental positions dramatically different from Obama — most notably in calling for an end of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands.Sunrise's O'Hanlon said the 1986 bill was an important stance “at that time” but added that Biden's 2020 climate plan is “much less ambitious than his rivals'.”

For any voter, there has been a lot to process in the inquiry — a country called Ukraine, a whistleblower, another whistleblower, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, various ambassadors, and two men named Igor and Lev.By then, the first crucial facts had come to light: A whistleblower alleged that President Trump had called the Ukrainian president and asked him to investigate discredited allegations about the son of Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival.House Democrats had subpoenaed Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, who had acknowledged that he was working on behalf of Trump to gather damaging information about Biden, Biden’s son and others.AD

Giuliani’s debunked assertions about former vice president Joe Biden having been involved in untoward activity center on the 2016 firing of Ukraine’s then-general prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.Shokin says that he was fired because he was investigating a company for which Joe Biden’s son Hunter was working, though Shokin is the only official making that claim.According to Bloomberg, people working with Firtash obtained a sworn statement in which Shokin leveled the allegations against Biden.Facebook also announced it removed a network of Russian-backed phony accounts that praised Trump and attacked former vice president Joe Biden, my colleagues Tony Romm and Isaac Stanley-Becker report.It is rare for Biden to offer a complete apology; his usually fall into the “I really regret some have taken totally out of context” category, as occurred in 2007 when he called then-candidate Barack Obama, whom he would later serve as vice president, “articulate and bright and clean.”

Tuesday’s apology marked how potentially significant his campaign viewed his use of the word, and also highlighted how Biden’s long history in public life has not always been an advantage.Biden was attempting to limit the damage to what has been the bulwark of his support — black voters — even as he struck out Wednesday to attempt to highlight his ­middle-class roots and an economic policy designed to win back voters in the industrial ­Midwest.AD

AD

Unlike his Democratic primary rivals, Biden has often had to clean up his past comments before taking a shot at Trump.The latest example occurred after Trump on Tuesday morning said that the impeachment inquiry amounted to a “lynching.” Biden and many other Democrats and Republicans denounced his use of the word and said it was intended to deepen racial wounds.“Impeachment is not ‘lynching,’ it is part of our Constitution,” Biden tweeted in response.“Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense,” Biden said in an interview with Wolf Blitzer.After several hours of criticism, Biden responded.AD

“This wasn’t the right word to use and I’m sorry about that,” Biden tweeted Tuesday night.Biden quickly transitioned into a criticism of Trump, attempting to argue that he didn’t mean to use the word divisively, whereas Trump did.AD

Biden, whose standing in the race has been supported by a huge advantage among black voters, was not alone, however.AD

The apology came amid new polling that indicated Biden may be gaining ground, following relentless attacks from Trump over the work Biden’s son Hunter did in Ukraine at the same time Joe Biden took the lead on Ukraine policy when vice president.In a national CNN survey, Biden had the support of 34 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, marking his highest level in a CNN poll since just after his campaign began in late April.AD

The attacks from Trump have threatened to overshadow any effort to change the subject, but on Wednesday Biden attempted to turn toward an economic message by speaking before a friendly crowd two miles from the northeast Pennsylvania home where he grew up.AD

Although the speech was billed as centering on economic policy, Biden did not release any new ideas and instead reiterated his previous stances that are more incremental than the ones promoted by others in the field.Biden wants to repeal Trump-era tax cuts, make community college free for everyone and reduce the student debt burden of graduates who go into public service jobs.But mostly Biden painted himself as someone who can help the middle class — because, he said, his roots lie there.No matter what your station in life, no matter what your background is, you’re entitled to be treated with dignity.”

During hard times, Biden’s father, who shares his name, commuted to Wilmington, Del., to clean boilers for a heating and cooling company — and moved the family there in 1953.In his biography and on the campaign trail, Biden recounts that he and his siblings moved in with their grandparents during hard times.In Scranton, Biden sought to draw a contrast not just with the other Democrats, but also with Trump.“I don’t think Donald Trump is capable of understanding that,” Biden said later.“More than two months before the phone call that launched the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Ukraine’s newly elected leader was already worried about pressure from the U.S. president to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden.”

That won’t keep Republican from concocting more phony defenses.[William] Taylor’s testimony fleshed out the biggest open questions, including whether there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine (there was), what it involved (military aid), and what Trump wanted (investigations of the Biden family and the 2016 election.)“Former Vice President Joe Biden is favored by 50 percent and Trump by 44 percent.… In August, Biden received 51 percent and Trump 42 percent.AD

Democrats, meanwhile, are looking to make the proceedings public by mid-November as they build a case about Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden while U.S. military aid to the country was being withheld.12:10 p.m.: Navarro dodges question on whether he asked China to investigate the Bidens

In an interview with CNN’s Jim Sciutto, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro repeatedly declined to say whether he asked Chinese officials to investigate the Bidens as part of the ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations.“Did you bring up investigating the Bidens as part of the negotiations?”

Navarro demurred, saying, “It’s not an appropriate question, in my judgment.”

Earlier in the interview, Navarro told Sciutto: “You don’t have a right to know what happens behind closed doors in the administration.”

In an exchange with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House earlier this month, Trump himself publicly called on China to investigate the Bidens.Here's video of @jimsciutto asking Peter Navarro if political investigations about the Bidens have come up during China trade talks, and Navarro declining to answer.In May, the group asked the State Department for records related to alleged efforts by Trump and his administration to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: Most polls have asked Americans in specific terms what they think of President Trump requesting that his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky order an investigation into Joe Biden’s son.A Washington Post-Schar School poll earlier this month asked whether it was appropriate for Trump to request that Ukraine investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.When the names Trump and Biden were included in the question, 32 percent of U.S. adults said it was okay and 62 percent said it was not.What’s appropriate in terms of process and consequences is far less clear.”

This helps explain why Trump defenders on Capitol Hill have fixated more on complaining about the impeachment process than offering a substantive defense of Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine or his public call for China, from the White House lawn, to investigate the Bidens.Additional reporting, along with sworn testimony from administration officials, has established that this was part of a broader campaign to compel Kyiv to help Trump tar Democrats generally and Biden specifically.His prepared testimony returns repeatedly to his fears that Trump’s manipulation of Ukraine policy to discredit Biden is unethical and damaging to U.S. national security.“Vindman cites a July 10 meeting in which Gordon Sondland, a major Trump donor and ambassador to the European Union, emphasized that to secure a meeting with Trump, the Ukrainians would have to ‘deliver investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,’ a Ukrainian natural gas company that had controversially tapped Biden’s son to serve on its board.Vindman’s statement notes that an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma would likely inject Ukraine’s new president into U.S. politics and cause the struggling democracy to lose bipartisan support in Congress.), a surrogate for the campaign of former vice president Joe Biden — argues that such coarse chants are inappropriate for a democracy, and that talk of jailing political opponents is the stuff of authoritarian regimes.Ambassador Gordon Sondland about investigating former vice president Joe Biden or his son Hunter, Politico reports.Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the [National Security Council] was going to get involved in or push,” Vindman said in his opening statement.Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the [National Security Council] was going to get involved in or push,” Vindman said in his opening statement.The contradiction: Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CBN News that “not once was a Biden name — not the former vice president, not his son — ever mentioned.” But the timeline “would put Perry in the meeting when Vindman raised his objections about Sondland's request that Ukrainian officials investigate the Bidens — which Perry has repeatedly denied,” Politico reports.Here’s how Ingraham described its provenance: “I want you to listen to some unearthed footage of front-runner Joe Biden from way back in November 2006.”

AD

Given the “unearthed” phrasing, viewers might have supposed that a team of worms pushed the clip up through Washington’s soil, whereupon they projected it onto a screen on the Mall.The actual explanation is a bit different: CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski — of his namesake KFILE investigative group — published on May 10 a full examination of the 2006 video in which Biden explained his immigration position to the Columbia Rotary Club in South Carolina.The footage highlighted the struggles that Biden faces wiggling between his centrist past and the sensibilities of the progressive Democratic base in the ongoing primary campaign.Accordingly, the Biden-fence piece secured extensive attention at the network.This is a soundbite that is flashing back to Joe Biden back in 2006 when he was taking a bold move to support a wall.Take a listen.”

AD

Again on June 2, “Fox & Friends” circled back to the Biden-fence clip.After playing it, co-host Ed Henry said, “So there you are, he’s on camera and we’ve got the record: In 2006, actually voted, didn’t just talk about it, voted for 700 miles of border fence.”

Hours after CNN’s fence scoop surfaced, @TrumpWarRoom picked up the video and packaged it in a tweet:

AD

Biden: “I believe the fence is needed…[because] people are driving across that border with TONS, TONS, hear me, TONS of everything from byproducts for methamphetamine to cocaine to heroin & it's all coming up through corrupt Mexico.”



Thanks for the support Joe!“The campaign’s war room, President Trump’s war room, has put out this video of Biden advocating for a border fence, something not so popular with Democratic primary voters.”

Other outlets managed to do the right thing and credit CNN, including Politico, the Washington Examiner, the Daily Caller and, yes, FoxNews.com.2: On June 13, Kaczynski presented a video from 2006 in which Biden held forth on his views about abortion.But this newly unearthed video from 2006 shows then-Sen. Joe Biden taking a very different stance.3: On March 7, Kaczynski scooped a 1993 Biden speech on the Senate floor speaking in favor of the now-infamous 1994 crime bill.They are beyond the pale many of those people, beyond the pale,” said Biden.AD

AD

Considering that Carlson grabbed the Biden clip months after CNN dug it up, it’s tempting to give him a pass.They have needed all those human resources to mine the expansive fossil record of Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972.Kaczynski tells the Erik Wemple Blog that KFILE has constructed a database with more than 120 hours of Biden footage.This year, he wondered whether Biden had contributed similar rhetoric to the mid-1990s crime debate.— New York Times, May 1, 2019

“In March 2016, Biden made one of his many trips to Ukraine and told the country’s leaders that they had to get rid of the prosecutor if they wanted $1 billion in U.S. aid.”

“In March 2016, Biden was in Kiev, where he was scheduled to announce a $1 billion American loan to the Ukrainian government.”

AD

This is just a sampling of the many news organizations — starting with the New York Times in the first paragraph of a front-page article — that reported that Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid unless a top prosecutor was fired while on a trip to Kiev in March 2016.AD

But here’s the rub: Biden never traveled to Ukraine that month.Because Biden managed to squeeze months of diplomacy into a few hours when he recounted the story years later at the Council on Foreign Relations.Biden’s tale, ironically, has become exhibit 1 in President Trump’s false narrative that Biden ousted the prosecutor because he was investigating a company associated with his son Hunter Biden.AD

The Facts

Here’s’ what Biden said during a 2018 appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations:

“I remember going over, convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees.And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

From Biden’s story, it sounds like things had happened very fast, in the space of six hours.In August 2016, in fact, Biden gave a somewhat less dramatic version of the story to the Atlantic magazine:

“He described, for example, a meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko—whom he calls ‘Petro’—in which he urged Poroshenko to fire a corrupt prosecutor general or see the withdrawal of a promised $1 billion loan to Ukraine.‘Petro, you’re not getting your billion dollars,’ Biden recalled telling him.Just understand—we’re not paying if you do.’ Poroshenko fired the official.”

Biden was carrying out a policy developed at the State Department and coordinated with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.AD

Pyatt kicked off the effort with a speech on Sept. 24, 2015 in which he blasted Shokin for “openly and aggressively undermining reform” and having “undermined prosecutors working on legitimate corruption cases.” In testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Oct. 8, Nuland declared: “The Prosecutor General’s Office has to be reinvented as an institution that serves the citizens of Ukraine, rather than ripping them off.”

Biden followed up with a visit to Kiev in December.On Dec. 7, he held a news conference with Poroshenko and announced $190 million to “fight corruption in law enforcement and reform the justice sector.” He made no public mention of the loan guarantee, but behind the scenes he had explicitly linked the $1 billion loan guarantee to reform efforts, including removing Shokin, according to Colin Kahl, Biden’s national security adviser at the time.AD

Kahl said Biden had a version of the parliament speech in which he would have announced the loan guarantee if Poroshenko immediately had taken the actions demanded by the United States and its international partners.But since the Ukrainian leader did not remove Shokin during that trip, Biden instead emphasized the country’s corruption in his speech.AD

Biden next met on Jan. 20 with Poroshenko on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, when he also pressed “the need to continue to move forward on Ukraine’s anti-corruption agenda,” according to a White House statement.Kahl said Biden at that meeting reinforced the linkage between the loan guarantee and the necessary reforms.Feb. 12: Biden spoke to Poroshenko by phone.Feb. 18: Another call took place between Biden and Poroshenko.AD

That same day, Biden spoke separately to Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.March 22: Biden and Poroshenko spoke again by phone, mainly about Russia’s conviction and sentencing of Ukrainian pilot and member of parliament Nadiya Savchenko, who had been captured by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.On March 31, Poroshenko met with Biden during a trip to Washington, and Biden emphasized that the loan guarantee was contingent on further reform progress beyond Shokin’s removal.AD

On April 14, Biden and Poroshenko had another call.Biden congratulated the president on his new cabinet and “stressed the urgency of putting in place a new Prosecutor General who would bolster the agency’s anti-corruption efforts and strongly support the work of its reformers,” a White House statement said.On May 13, in a phone call, Biden told Poroshenko he welcomed Lutsenko’s appointment and creation of an inspector general in the prosecutor’s office.The Bottom Line

As we demonstrated, Biden was never in Kiev in March 2016, as many news organizations have reported.The tying of $1 billion in loan guarantees to needed reforms, including the ouster of Shokin, was a policy pursued over many months, but Biden’s explicit linkage was made during his trip to Kiev in December — three months earlier.Biden’s overly dramatic foreshortening of events has confused many reporters, including here at The Fact Checker.The complaint described a July 25 call in which Trump pressed Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the activities of former vice president Joe Biden and his son and subsequent efforts to restrict access to records of the call.At that time — following Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelenksy — the Ukrainians probably understood action on corruption to include the investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Officials close to Pence insist that he was unaware of Trump’s efforts to press Zelensky for damaging information about Biden and his son, who had served on the board of an obscure Ukrainian gas company, when his father was overseeing U.S. policy on Ukraine.The poll shows just 45 percent think Trump either “made any promises” to Zelensky or “put any pressure on” him to investigate Biden.That 45-36 split on whether Trump at least applied pressure on Zelensky is actually very similar to the split on whether Biden applied pressure on Ukraine to stop investigating his son — 42 percent to 37 percent.A plurality of Americans say it is “probably” true that Biden “put pressure on Ukrainian officials to get them not to investigate his son’s business dealings there.”

Except that that allegation is dubious at best.U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said the investigation of the company that employed Biden’s son Hunter Biden, Burisma Holdings, was dormant at the time that then-Vice President Biden was pressuring Ukraine to remove its prosecutor general.The prosecutor general himself wasn’t even investigating the Bidens, but rather the company.Biden’s effort was hardly extraordinary, relative to that of other powerful Ukraine allies.The 42 percent who believe the Biden claim may simply be Trump’s die-hard base, but it’s worth noting that it’s still more than those who disbelieve it (37 percent).Giuliani has made clear since May that it was his intention to get people to focus on the Ukraine story, because it could help Trump in his reelection bid — apparently by neutralizing the Democrat who polls best against Trump, Biden.But it does appear to be having some of the intended effect on Biden, despite the available evidence.Under Biden’s proposal, a gun owner would either have to sell the weapon to the government or register it.AD

AD

Biden also proposes requiring new guns to include biometric technology that enables a gun to be used only by those authorized to do so, an idea he talks about frequently on the campaign trail.“Why is it any violation of the First Amendment at all to say, from this moment on, every weapon we sold, every gun we sold in America, has to have your biometric marker on it?” Biden told reporters in August.You go out there and you can own it, you can use it.”

Biden’s plan comes as the campaign attempts to shift focus to guns this week — as it focused onhealth care last week — amid a rapidly shifting political dynamic that has altered the presidential campaign.Biden has become a central character in the impeachment inquiry that resulted from President Trump’s decision to ask the Ukrainian president to investigate unsubstantiated allegations about Biden and his son Hunter.Biden does not fully endorse the March for Our Lives plan, but he does adopt some of its proposals.AD

Biden has frequently touted his willingness to take on the National Rifle Association, pointing to his efforts in 1993 in passing a law establishing the background check system, and in 1994 in passing a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.AD

Biden also spearheaded the Obama administration’s efforts to reduce gun violence after the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012.When asked during a CNN interview this summer what he would say to gun owners who think he’s coming for their guns, Biden said, “Bingo!Biden’s plan says that he would enact legislation giving states and local government grants to require individuals to obtain a license before purchasing a gun — although he has in the past been skeptical of the concept.“Gun licensing will not change whether or not people buy what weapons — what kinds of weapons they can buy, where they can use them, how they can store them,” Biden said in June.To restrict the ability to quickly stockpile weapons, Biden would restrict the number of firearms an individual may purchase to one per month.Biden also favors rescinding a law that helps protect gun manufacturers from being held civilly liable for their products.Should Zelensky find improprieties by the Bidens, even better.It’s broken out into two, overlapping universes, one focused on implicating the Bidens (the green lines) and one focused on the Russia investigation (blue lines).The Bidens

Trump and his attorney Rudolph Giuliani insist that Joe Biden’s December 2015 demand that Ukraine’s then-president fire general prosecutor Viktor Shokin was a function of Shokin’s investigation into Burisma Holdings, a company for which Hunter Biden was working.While Shokin insists that such a probe was underway and that Biden’s demand was linked to it, the available evidence suggests that no such investigation was underway and, further, that there was nothing about Hunter Biden’s work that was related to questions about Burisma’s business practices.AD

Giuliani’s efforts to uncover dirt on the Bidens included multiple conversations with Lutsenko and at least one meeting with Shokin (according to the complaint filed by an intelligence community whistleblower).The pro-Trump, anti-impeachment talking points run the gamut: The president’s call to Ukraine was “perfect.” Former vice president Joe Biden corruptly benefited his family while working in government.The image shows Joe and Hunter Biden, the younger Biden’s longtime business partner Devon Archer and another unidentified man.The chyron says “Joe, Hunter Biden pictured golfing with Ukraine gas company exec in 2014.” That’s a reference to Archer, an American who joined the board of a Ukrainian gas company with Hunter Biden.Counting the younger Biden, there are two Ukraine gas company executives in the frame.announces he is drafting legislation to ban immediate family members of Senators, members of Congress, the president or the vice president from working for “any entity doing business in or with Ukraine.” This is an indirect shot at Hunter Biden, whose father is no longer vice president and who no longer works for a Ukrainian company.He alleges via tweet that The Post, NBC News and CNN are “going after me because I’m the messenger, and covering up the message, Dem corruption.” He says Biden “is protected and immune like the Clintons and crooked Clinton foundation!” It is not clear what stories he is referring to.AD

The Democratic chairs demanded interviews to shed light on Trump’s pressure on the Ukrainian president to get involved in the next U.S. election on Trump’s behalf, by helping validate conspiracy theories undercutting the legitimacy of the special counsel investigation, and by manufacturing smears against potential general election opponent Joe Biden.What stands out in the call, of course, is what caught the attention of the whistleblower and his sources — namely the request that Zelensky work with Attorney General William P. Barr and Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, to find negative information about former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.But to see him in the office of the president putting his own personal and political interests ahead of the national security of our country just pierced through whatever confusion or denial people had.”

Shortly before the show was taped, the Wall Street Journal reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was listening in on the phone call at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, in which Trump sought the Ukrainian president’s assistance in investigating his main political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden.AD

The lawsuit preceded the current storm surrounding a House impeachment inquiry into the White House, which was triggered by a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations against former vice president Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden.6:12 a.m. Herbst also contradicts the Trump argument that Biden did something wrong by pushing to fire Viktor Shokin, a Ukrainian prosecutor who once investigated a company that employed Biden's son.Herbst also notes that the Shokin affidavit saying Biden’s concerns over his son’s company caused his firing was written to aid attorneys for Dmytro Firtash, an oligarch U.S. officials are seeking to extradite on a warrant of bribery.“And in fact it undermines their position.”

8:32 a.m. Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, is asked a question that will not go away anytime soon.Does the former vice president have any regrets about not keeping son Hunter Biden from working for the Ukrainian firm while Biden oversaw Ukrainian policy at the White House?“No, because he didn’t do anything wrong,” Bedingfield says of the younger Biden on CNN’s “New Day.”

8:46 a.m. Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who quit after undermining his reelection hopes by opposing Trump, calls on other Republican senators “to risk your careers in favor of your principles.” In a Washington Post opinion piece, he describes removing Trump from office through impeachment as a tough call, but argues that opposing Trump’s reelection is a moral necessity.AD

AD

11:21 a.m. Ukraine’s former top law enforcement official Yuri Lutsenko, who took over after Shokin was fired, recounts yet again the efforts by Trump to pressure him to investigate the Biden family.He has denounced the “witch hunt,” called the whistleblower “Fake Whistleblower” and declared “the Bidens were corrupt!” He also raised the possibility that Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested “for treason” for using words Trump never spoke to dramatize the president’s call to Ukraine.“Let me explain how — if we go to the Politico article, please — the problems for Joe Biden are serious here and especially — look at Politico, 2017.Upton, who has served in Congress for more than three decades, including during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment, said last week in a statement that the developments regarding Trump seeking assistance from Ukraine to obtain dirt on former vice president Joe Biden were “disconcerting,” but that he wanted to “review the facts that emerge before making any conclusions.”

AD

AD

Upton, one of the last remaining so-called moderates in the House Republican caucus, has taken a stand against Trump’s behavior in the past.Trump has blithely conceded he brought up Joe Biden on his call with the Ukrainian president, while also saying there was nothing wrong with this, because he was merely trying to make U.S. military aid contingent on rooting out “corruption.”

In other words, Trump is explicitly saying he can legitimately pressure a foreign leader — who is desperately awaiting that aid — to work against his political opponent, simply by falsifying that opponent’s conduct and then calling it “corruption.”

Trump has unlimited power to declare any profoundly corrupt act on his part legitimate.“The Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump pressed the president of Ukraine eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden’s son,” Raddatz said.AD

Pompeo then pivoted again, this time to insinuate improper behavior by former vice president Joe Biden.AD

The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign announced a combined $10 million in television and digital spending last week, with the RNC unveiling an ad that battles the accusations against Trump by raising questions about former vice president Joe Biden’s dealings.AD

While dozens of Democrats did back an impeachment probe over the summer recess, it wasn’t until last month, with the emergence of allegations that Trump used U.S. military aid for Ukraine as leverage to secure dirt on Biden, that Pelosi and other senior Democrats embraced an impeachment inquiry.The men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, have been assisting Giuliani’s push to get Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, as well as Giuliani’s claim that Democrats conspired with Ukrainians in the 2016 campaign.That puts him in the same sector as former ecology minister Mykola Zlochevsky, who owns one of the country’s largest gas producers and brought then-Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter onto his board.In May 2018, about six months before the men began working with Giuliani on his Biden investigation, a Florida business established by Parnas received a $1.26 million wire transfer from an account whose owner was represented by a real estate lawyer who specializes in assisting foreign buyers of U.S. property, court documents and corporate filings show.A member of the Progressive Caucus, she came out for impeachment early, on July 25 — the very day, it turns out, when Trump had his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asking him to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.AD

Trump bared his frustrations in a heated exchange with a journalist who asked him about a July 25 phone call in which Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate one of his potential Democratic challengers, former vice president Joe Biden.Trump is demanding a criminal investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Be smart and avoid Soviet style clichés🧐 pic.twitter.com/C1WrSOo8ay — UKR Embassy in USA (@UKRintheUSA) September 28, 2019

Ukraine has found itself as an unusual topic of conversation — and target of scrutiny — in the United States since last week, when it was revealed that President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into business dealings related to Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president Joe Biden.On Wednesday, House Democrats promised to subpoena the White House by the end of the week if officials refuse to produce documents related to Trump’s July phone call with Ukraine’s president and other efforts to persuade the country’s new leader to investigate Trump’s political rival Joe Biden.AD

Giuliani, who was a leading figure in pushing the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and pushing for the removal earlier this year of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, has insisted he was on a mission for the State Department.Elsewhere in the call, Trump also pressed for an investigation into Biden and the former vice president’s son.“They want to do their jobs, serve their country and not be pulled into this.”

The Democrats’ quest for answers took a bizarre turn on Wednesday after State Department Inspector General Steve Linick provided lawmakers a packet of documents containing conspiracy theories and other unproven claims about Biden, his son and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump criticized in his phone call with Zelensky.On Wednesday night, Giuliani told “CNN Today” that he was responsible for sending some of the materials in the packet to the State Department, saying he sent an “outline” of allegations against Biden and Yovanovitch.AD

Raskin called the packet a “completely irrelevant distraction.”

During Wednesday’s news conference with the Finnish president, Trump refused to say exactly what he wanted from the Ukrainian president regarding Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Trump ignored the question posed by a reporter and focused his answer instead on why he held back military aid to Ukraine, citing, as he has in the past, corruption there and the claim that the United States is the “only one who gives the big money to Ukraine.”

When the reporter pressed Trump to answer his question about the Bidens, Trump became angry and demanded that the reporter “not be rude” and instead ask a question of the Finnish president.Trump eventually said that “Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked,” then leveled his oft-made attack against the “fake news” media.Specifically, before Pence did any of those things, Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, repeatedly said he wanted Ukraine to investigate — i.e., fabricate smears against — Biden, on Trump’s behalf.Trump himself said publicly that Biden’s activities in Ukraine merited scrutiny.And Pence privately met with Zelensky in September, to tell him hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid would not be released, due to concerns about Ukrainian “corruption.”

AD

Pence’s aides are claiming he was unaware of the pressure that Trump had been placing on Zelensky to manufacture dirt to smear Biden.Here’s the timeline, with Pence’s pressure on the Ukrainian president in bold:

May 9: The New York Times publishes a big story about Giuliani’s plan to push Ukraine to investigate two matters: the origins of the special-counsel investigation finding Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf, and the matter involving Biden.AD

That narrative, which holds that Biden pressured Ukraine to oust a prosecutor to protect his son Hunter, has been entirely debunked.AD

May 10: Giuliani tweets about this whole plan the next day, saying Biden should be “investigated” by Ukraine.(Again, that’s code for “smeared with lies.”)

May 19: Trump goes on Fox News and rails about Biden and Ukraine, falsely claiming that Biden improperly pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was supposedly “after” his son.June 21: Giuliani tweets an explicit demand that Zelensky ramp up the investigations into Biden.AD

Pence’s aides are also now claiming that, when Pence told Zelensky the problem was that Ukraine needed to investigate “corruption,” he didn’t understand that this was code for smearing Biden.But as Jonathan Chait points out, this is wildly implausible, because it’s overwhelmingly likely Pence already understood how this code worked — that the call for investigating “corruption” was cover for a demand to smear Biden.After all, it had been public for months that Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate Biden, and there’s no way Pence believes that Trump actually cares about “corruption.”

AD

The bigger point here is that of course Pence perfectly understood the role of his own actions in this whole plot.July 25: Trump in a phone call asks the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, a potential Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, and Hunter Biden, according to a readout of the conversation released by the White House.Here’s Trump making the request:

“The other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...It sounds horrible to me.” (In making this request, Trump falsely claimed that Biden as vice president stopped Ukrainian prosecutors from pursuing a case involving his son.)Aug. 12: An intelligence community whistleblower files a complaint based on Trump’s request that Ukraine investigate Biden and related issues.It reads in part: “According to the White House officials who had direct knowledge of the call, the President pressured Mr. Zelenskyy to, inter alia: initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.”

AD

AD

Sept. 20: The Wall Street Journal reports that “President Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son.” The Washington Post and other news outlets confirm that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.And we have heard from reporting in the Wall Street Journal that the president asked Zelensky about eight times to have the Ukraine work with his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s involvement in Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company.The Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump pressed the president of Ukraine eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden’s son.It’s been remarkably consistent, and we will continue to try to drive those set of outcomes.”

AD

AD

We asked whether Pompeo had a role preparing or briefing Trump for the July 25 phone call with Zelensky, and if so, whether the request to investigate the Bidens came up in the preparations.Biden, who spent four decades in the Senate, has in the past sought to separate Trump and his base from the Republican Party that contains his friends and peers, including many he served with as a senator.But in his remarks here, Biden slammed the GOP and “hatchet men” who he said echo Trump’s words.His party fans out to carry the smear,” Biden said.I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.”

Biden said the attacks by Trump were an attempt to “pick his opponent and go against only the candidates he thinks he can beat.Well, we’re not going to let Donald Trump pick his candidate.”

Democrats have begun to worry that Trump’s relentless attacks on Biden will weigh on the campaign, even if they’re baseless.If Biden is the Democratic nominee there is fear that Trump could succeed in sowing doubt in voters’ minds.AD

Trump has accused Biden of pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in 2016 to benefit his son, Hunter.AD

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors over possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.At the time that Joe Biden, then acting in his capacity as vice president, sought to have Viktor Shokin, the Ukrainian prosecutor, ousted, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.Biden and other Western officials have said they were in agreement that Shokin needed to go because he was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases in Ukraine.AD

Biden said Trump sought to discredit him and his family because, “like every bully in history, he’s afraid.He’s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.”

AD

During a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, Trump asked him to investigate Biden’s son for possible corruption.In the roughly 30 minutes that Biden spoke, he didn’t touch on the appearance of a conflict of interest.Earlier Wednesday, during a news conference with the president of Finland, Trump called Biden and his son “stone-cold crooked.”

AD

Biden was asked about Trump and impeachment during a gun-safety forum in Las Vegas and was asked if he had spoken to Hunter Biden about the matter.Biden said they had “communicated a couple of times” but did not offer more detail.“But look, there is zero, zero, zero, zero evidence of any assertion being made, I’m not going to … look, the issue is this president of the United States engaged in something apparently that is close to, well, engaged in activity that at minimum gives a lot of running room for the Russians and Ukraine and I think we should just focus on the issue,” Biden told the reporters.Meanwhile, the gaps appear at places where the conversation turns to more incriminating matters — such as Trump’s pressure on Zelensky to find evidence undercutting Russian culpability, or to manufacture smears of potential campaign opponent Joe Biden — suggesting the possibility of key omissions.The Post reports that Trump repeatedly employed Pence to pressure Zelensky, at the same time Trump was working to get Zelensky to manufacture anti-Biden smears via other channels.The Post recounted:

When Reuters’s Jeff Mason tried again and again to ask the [Joe] Biden-specific question, Trump became angry and demanded that Mason “not be rude” and instead ask a question of the Finnish president.When Mason pressed him, Trump responded that “Biden and his son are stone cold crooked,” then leveled his oft-made attack against the “fake news” media.There is no acceptable answer to that question, because we now have a rough transcript of the call in which he repeatedly seeks to enlist the Ukrainian president’s help in finding (nonexistent) dirt on Biden.As Biden said on Wednesday, “It’s way beyond anything I frankly thought he would do.”

Trump and his embarrassing spinners can concoct whatever irrelevant and false excuses they want.Biden carried out the Obama administration’s and the West’s anti-corruption agenda in urging Ukraine to fire an ineffective prosecutor (who was not in any event investigating Biden’s son at the time).For purposes of Trump’s impeachment, Biden’s actions don’t matter.AD

Leaving the meeting, Rep.

Trump ordered the removal of U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from her post in Kiev after hearing concerns from Giuliani and former Texas congressman Pete Sessions, among others, according to a senior administration official, who confirmed the Wall Street Journal’s reporting.AD

Giuliani informed the president that he thought Yovanovitch was blocking his investigation into Biden and that she was against Trump.He told the Journal, which first broke the story, that he had seen Yovanovitch “as an obstacle” in his pursuit for information about Biden from Ukrainians.AD

A bipartisan letter dated Feb. 12, 2016, signed by Republican Sens.The letter, first unearthed by CNN, shows that then-vice president Joe Biden was not alone in wanting Ukraine to oust its prosecutor over concerns about the corruption pervasive in the country.The senators wrote to the Ukrainian president that they “urge you to press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General’s office and judiciary.”

Trump has said that Biden wanted the prosecutor ousted because he’d investigated a Ukrainian natural gas company that employed Biden’s son, Hunter.Notably, since it was revealed that Trump asked the Ukrainian president for help getting information about Biden and his son, Johnson has said he would consider opening a congressional investigation into Biden’s engagements with Ukraine.“In carrying out that perversion, Mr. Barr has clearly violated [your] Rules of Professional Conduct he swore to uphold and should face the severest sanction your body can mete out: revocation of his law licensure.”

10:30 a.m.: Trump calls for China to investigate the Bidens

Trump suggested Thursday that another foreign country should investigate Biden and his son Hunter, even though House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry against him over his request that the Ukrainian president do the same.Biden is a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Trump told reporters.Trump’s allegations regarding Hunter Biden and China center on him joining the board of an investment firm whose partners included Chinese entities while his father was vice president.Asked what he wanted from Zelensky, Trump said, “I would think if they were honest about it, they’d start a major investigation into the Bidens.”

Trump added: “Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.”

Asked whether he had requested Chinese President Xi Jinping to help investigate the Bidens, Trump replied: “I haven’t, but it’s certainly something we can start thinking about, because I’m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny.”

Trump also told reporters he had fired former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch because he “heard very bad things about her.”

Yovanovitch was recalled from her position in Ukraine this year amid political attacks by conservative media and other allies of Trump, including Giuliani, who targeted her with unsubstantiated accusations and argued that she “should be part of the investigation as part of the collusion.”

Yovanovitch is scheduled to appear before three House committees on Oct. 11 as part of the impeachment inquiry.“So the fact that their loyalty is to Trump and not to the Constitution is not going to slow down or impair our ability to keep the republic.”

During the interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, Pelosi also pushed back on a Republican argument that Trump’s call with Zelensky was not problematic because there was no explicit “quid pro quo” between providing U.S. military aid to Ukraine and investigating the Bidens.6 a.m.: Biden, in fiery remarks, tells Trump: ‘I’m not going anywhere’

RENO, Nev. — Biden struck a defiant tone Wednesday night during a campaign speech in which he ripped Trump’s efforts to smear him and assured supporters that Trump won’t destroy him or his candidacy.The top-polling 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has become inextricably intertwined with the impeachment inquiry into Trump’s behavior, which centers on Trump asking a foreign leader for dirt on Biden’s son.Biden, who spent four decades in the Senate, has in the past sought to separate Trump and his base from the Republican Party that contains his friends and peers, including many he served with as a senator.But in his remarks here, Biden slammed the GOP and “hatchet men” who he said echo Trump’s words.His party fans out to carry the smear,” Biden said.AD

When, on July 25, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he wanted Ukraine to dig into a derogatory theory Trump had about former vice president Joe Biden, Trump may not have been explicitly considering the legal ramifications.“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Trump said to reporters.China, in other words, should try to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter — information that, if generated, would certainly be of use to Trump in a possible general-election fight against the leading candidate for the Democratic Party’s 2020 nomination.“I don’t think it is credible that Trump has some other reason for seeking foreign investigations of Biden other than to help his 2020 campaign,” former Federal Election Commission general counsel Larry Noble told The Washington Post over email.“It is the only context in which Biden is relevant to Trump.”

AD

Noble pointed out that Trump had even tried to obfuscate the target of his request to Zelensky before the rough transcript was released, insisting that he had been pushing Zelensky to act on corruption broadly.That rough transcript, though, makes clear that Biden — a potential political opponent — was the sole focus of Trump’s “corruption” concerns.Here, we know what Trump is asking for”: information linking Biden to corrupt acts.PENCE in June:

“People have a right to know if the [Bidens] profited from [VP job]" pic.twitter.com/VXUHdosmoK — JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) October 3, 2019

Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama who now teaches at New York University Law School, described in a phone conversation with The Post last year how value was determined.It could not be more transparent: Donald Trump is terrified that Joe Biden will beat him like a drum.Biden’s statement that Trump is a serial wrongdoer is indisputable and should be echoed immediately by the other Democratic presidential candidates and congressional leaders.That is what he did on the White House lawn when he called, again, for Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and also asked another country, China, with whom we are engaged in a destructive trade war, to do the same.Giuliani has admitted working on Trump’s behalf to dig up information related to the Biden allegations, including meeting with Ukrainian officials.Trump has been explicit since the release of the call’s rough transcript and the whistleblower complaint that he believes Ukraine should investigate Biden.Asked what he wanted President Zelensky to do about the Bidens, “If they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens.” pic.twitter.com/CZ0ikrtEdp — Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) October 3, 2019

These stipulated facts are at the heart of the Democratic push to impeach the president.AD

AD

The Democrats’ central argument is that Trump sought Zelensky’s assistance in aiding Trump politically, either by undermining Biden (a possible 2020 opponent) or undermining the investigation into Russian interference — and, specifically, the individuals involved in launching it.We are unquestionably now in the midst of the 2020 campaign, and Biden is one of the most likely opponents Trump will face.Undermining Biden is an electoral benefit to Trump.Trump’s push for Ukraine to investigate Biden wasn’t about Biden, as such, but about corruption more broadly — the issue at the heart of Biden’s own opposition to Ukraine’s former general prosecutor.Maybe Biden actually did something wrong?The vast weight of the available evidence suggests that Biden’s push to oust Ukraine’s general prosecutor and for reforms aimed at combating corruption in 2015 was in line with American policy and agreed upon by both Democrats and Republicans.Trump’s focus is solely on Biden, what he thinks Biden did and what he thinks Biden’s son Hunter did.Trump tells Zelensky that “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it” — here the transcript includes an ellipsis — “It sounds horrible to me.”

That’s the question: Is that acceptable?It would force the media to recount and show clips of the participants making clear that former vice president Joe Biden has done nothing wrong.Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rob Portman of Ohio once co-authored, before becoming sycophants, encouraging Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin’s office to be shaken up and anti-corruption measures to be undertaken, the very same message Biden carried to Ukraine from President Barack Obama.)AD

AD

Former vice president Joe Biden can make up for lost time and go on offense.“This is the moment for Biden to embrace his decades of national security experience, to sound the alarm on election security and to call out Russia hawks in the Republican Party.Three of the four come when Trump is talking about the two specific investigations he wants, on CrowdStrike and on former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden:

AD

AD

TRUMP: I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike ...And:

TRUMP: The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ...Trump refers to how he wants Ukraine to “look into it” — referring to the matter involving the Bidens — and then immediately after the ellipsis again refers to “it” — apparently repeating the personal pronoun he had just used to refer to the “matter involving the Bidens.” It’s possible there might be something between those two comments, but they make sense right next to one another.When he announced a trip to Kiev in May, Giuliani planned to encourage the new administration to probe connections related to former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Thursday morning, he openly called for both Ukraine and China to interfere with the election by providing dirt on former vice president Joe Biden.Pompeo on Ukraine

The claim: After ABC News’s Martha Raddatz asked Pompeo about reports that Trump pressured Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, Pompeo responded, “So, you just gave me a report about a [intelligence community] whistleblower complaint, none of which I’ve seen.” He added: “I think I saw a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister yesterday, said there was no pressure applied in the course of the conversation."And he often leaned heavily on that goodwill — as former vice president Joe Biden previously noted — to prop up his 2008 presidential campaign.said he plans to issue a subpoena for White House documents by the end of the week centered on Trump's requests to the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, former vice president Joe Biden.Two months later, on July 25, Trump repeatedly urged Zelensky in a phone call to investigate Biden, offering to enlist Attorney General William P. Barr in that effort while dangling the possibility of a White House meeting, according to a rough transcript of the call the White House released.The Russian leader also came to Trump's defense as the president faces an impeachment investigation for a controversial call in which he seemingly pressed the leader of Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his family.Burisma’s owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment, but the investigation was dormant when Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, and none of the references to Black in conservative media carry any evidence that he was a target of the probe.That complaint revealed Trump’s request of Ukranian leaders to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a political rival.The whistleblower portrayed Volker as working with European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland to try to run interference between Ukrainian officials and Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was pressing for Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden.The text messages suggest that Volker and Sondland might more accurately be described as trying, at times, to effect what Giuliani — and Trump — wanted to see: an investigation into a completely unfounded attempt to link Ukraine to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee network in 2016 and a probe of Biden and work his son Hunter did for an energy company called Burisma Holdings.The Trump-Giuliani theory is that Joe Biden wanted Ukraine to fire its general prosecutor to protect Hunter and Burisma; there remains no significant evidence that this happened.“Heard from White House,” Volker wrote, “assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.”

AD

AD

This is as explicit a quid pro quo as you can get: Promise to get to the bottom of events in 2016 — which could refer to either the hacking or to the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor targeted by Biden — and you’ll get the validity that comes with a White House visit.The U.S. helped shape a statement from Ukraine mentioning the Biden probe.“Once we have a date,” the Zelensky aide wrote, “will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.”

AD

Again, an investigation into Burisma is, in essence, an investigation into Hunter Biden’s work and an effort to position Joe Biden as having acted unethically.We already know from the rough White House transcript of Trump’s call that he pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to “investigate” potential political opponent Joe Biden, based on an entirely fabricated narrative, and to substantiate a fringe conspiracy theory undercutting the fact of Russian interference in our election on his behalf.Just before the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker texted a Zelensky aide to say that he had “heard from White House” that “assuming” Zelensky were to persuade Trump that he will do the investigations, “we will nail down date for visit to Washington.”

AD

Subsequent to this, on the July 25 call, Trump directly pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden.“The Republicans are very unified,” Trump said, as he again insisted he had said nothing inappropriate during the July call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.AD

Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine, defended Biden in his opening statement to Congress on Thursday and said he was trying to run interference on information being supplied to Trump by Giuliani to secure continued American support for the government in Ukraine.Volker said he did not believe allegations that Giuliani has leveled against Joe Biden, namely that Biden was influenced in his dealings with the Ukrainian leadership by his son’s presence on the board of a Ukrainian gas company whose owner was being investigated by authorities in Kiev.“I have known former vice president Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son simply has no credibility to me,” Volker said.— Paul Sonne and Greg Jaffe

A spokesman for Cornyn clarified that the senator was referring to the ongoing investigation being conducted by U.S. Attorney John Durham into various activities surrounding the FBI’s Russia probe and that “the Durham investigation could end up also looking at the Bidens.”

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to messages, and an FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.When asked by a reporter later Friday morning if the Justice Department was looking into Biden, Trump said, “Well, that you’d have to ask Attorney General Barr, but I can tell you just as an observer that what I saw Biden do with his son, he’s pillaging these countries, and he’s hurting us.”

Beginning this weekend, the Trump campaign is airing more than $1 million worth of TV ads in early primary states that accuse Joe Biden and his son Hunter of corruption in Ukraine, according to Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager.The anti-Biden ads are part of a larger $8 million ad buy focused on impeachment, which the Trump camp is trying to spin to its advantage.CNN said Thursday it would not run the ad because the allegations of corruption against the Bidens highlighted in the ad are unsubstantiated.Trump’s contention, in a tweet, came at the end of a day in which he publicly urged both Ukraine and China to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden.This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens.This does have to do with their corruption!”

KIEV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s new chief prosecutor said Friday his office will conduct an “audit” of an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that had recruited Hunter Biden for its board.A criminal probe of the company was closed in 2016, and Trump has alleged it was because of pressure by Hunter Biden’s father, Joe Biden, who was then vice president.Ukrainian officials said previously that the probe was focused on the years 2010 to 2012, before the younger Biden joined the board.Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka told a news conference that he is aware of at least 15 investigations that may have touched on Burisma, its owner Nikolai Zlochevsky, an associate named Serhiy Zerchenko, and Biden, and that all will be reviewed.— Will Englund

6:30 a.m.: Trump wanted Ukraine’s president to launch investigations before face-to-face meeting, texts show

House investigators released numerous text messages late Thursday night illustrating how senior State Department officials coordinated with the Ukrainian president’s top aide and Trump’s personal lawyer to leverage a potential summit between the heads of state on a promise from the Ukrainians to investigate the 2016 U.S. election and an energy company that employed Biden’s son.Although the texts do not mention Biden by name, congressional Democrats leading an impeachment inquiry are pointing to them as clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing “to launch politically motivated investigations,” top Democrats said in a statement Thursday night.He comments on Twitter came hours after he told reporters that he would like to see investigations of the Bidens not only by Ukraine but also China, prompting an uproar from congressional Democrats.Here is a video of Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) responding to a constituent Thursday night at a town hall in Templeton, Iowa, who asked a pointed question about the president: “When are you guys going to say, ‘Enough?’”

5 a.m.: CNN declines to run Trump campaign ads

CNN said Thursday that it will not run two Trump campaign ads because they disparage the network’s journalists and make “demonstrably false” claims while discussing impeachment and pushing unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against Biden.The network’s decisions come as the Trump administration escalates its attacks on congressional Democrats’ impeachment efforts and continues to lash out at media organizations it tries to discredit as “fake news.”

CNN’s move brought renewed ire from Trump’s reelection campaign, as Communications Director Tim Murtaugh called the news network a “Democrat public relations firm” that “spends all day protecting Joe Biden.”

Read more here.But either way, Trump was angry, and his rambling question-and-answer session seemed to convey an essential truth: That he considers it fair game for him ask foreign governments to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter — who, Trump claimed again with no evidence, were the perpetrators of “tremendous corruption.”

AD

The president has long been comfortable with conspiracy theories.Trump repeatedly insisted that he was not worried about Biden as a possible 2020 rival — “I don’t care about Biden’s campaign, but I do care about corruption,” he said — a claim undermined by the fact that Trump fixated on Biden, mentioning the former vice president more than two dozen times.AD

He again claimed his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — during which he asked that the Ukrainians dig up dirt on Biden as “a favor” — was “perfect,” and that when he released notes from the conversation, the reaction was positive.“By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.”

Trump also falsely claimed that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the president’s phone call with Zelensky was “wonderful.” Though McConnell did defend Trump in a statement to Politico, saying the Democrats had “already overplayed their hand” by using the phone call to launch an impeachment inquiry, he was hardly effusive about Trump’s conversation with Zelensky.The president also accused Hunter Biden of taking “a billion and a half dollars out of China.” He seemed to be referring to the sum of money that a private-equity company based in China had said it hoped to raise.Hunter Biden became a board member of the firm, BHR Partners, in 2013, and later acquired a 10 percent interest in the entity overseeing the fund — but his lawyer has described Trump’s allegations against him as “a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden’s role with BHR.”

AD

AD

Turning his attention to Mueller’s Russia investigation, Trump described that probe as “perfect.”

“We went through two years of Mueller, and that came out like a 10,” the president said.Provided none has solicited election help from a foreign power, obstructed an investigation into the same or threatened a whistleblower, the Democratic nominee should be able to beat Trump “like a drum,” as Biden put it.Today’s comments publicly inviting China to investigate Biden, a political rival, while US is in delicate trade negotiations ALONE is an impeachable abuse of power.”

ADSo when he saw an opportunity to turn the tables and use Ukraine against former vice president Joe Biden, his leading potential Democratic rival in 2020, he grabbed it.Biden deserves some blame, too.Putting aside the false Trump conspiracy theories about him, Biden used poor judgment in playing a role on Ukraine policy while his son Hunter was working for Ukrainian gas company Burisma.More than two years later, in May 2019, Telizhenko would meet with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, as he was accelerating his efforts to gather dirt about Biden and other Democrats.After the Mueller investigation finally concluded with the released report in April, Trump and Giuliani saw Ukraine as a place to settle political scores — and perhaps damage Biden.“Most impt [important] is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation.”

AD

Volker warned Giuliani that the allegations about Biden were based on an unreliable informant, according to the State Department official.There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General [William P. Barr] would be great.”

AD

The Ukrainians thought the call had gone well.However, no evidence has emerged that Perry participated in the effort to pressure Ukranian officials to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.AD

It also may buy some time for Ukrainian authorities at a sticky moment — as they deal with the aftermath of Trump’s alleged favor-trading demand for a Biden probe, while trying to keep Ukraine’s image from being too tarnished by the House impeachment inquiry.Ryaboshapka reiterated Friday that he has seen no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.“Every smart top public official should understand that the story about Trump-&-Biden (read Republicans-&-Democrats) is not so fun for us,” he wrote in a text message.Hunter Biden was invited to join Burisma’s board in 2014.AD

Ryaboshapka said Friday that he was aware of at least 15 cases that were launched against Zlo­chevsky after Yanukovych’s downfall in 2014, all of which focused on the period before Biden joined the board and none of which came to anything.Eventually, Western officials, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, sought his ouster.That fueled Trump’s insistence that the senior Biden brought pressure on Kiev to protect his son and that a new criminal probe should be undertaken.On Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that “China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.”

His request for China to assist in an investigation into Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, came as Washington and Beijing prepare for trade talks next week.Volker, who as of Thursday was the executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, said he did not believe allegations Giuliani has leveled against Biden, namely that Biden was influenced in his dealings with the Ukrainian leadership by his son’s presence on the board of a Ukrainian gas company whose owner was being probed by authorities in Kiev.(Cindy McCain, a Biden friend, chairs the McCain Institute.)“I have known former vice president Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son simply has no credibility to me,” Volker said, according to a written copy of the opening statement reviewed by The Washington Post.“I know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country.”

Volker, who was serving in the special-envoy position in an unpaid capacity, said he was not on the July 25 call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his family.Volker’s statement casts the president’s reluctance to meet with Zelensky as having little to do with Biden or Burisma but instead related to his “long-held negative view towards Ukraine” and Giuliani’s assertion of Ukrainian malfeasance in the 2016 election.See you tomorrow — kurt.”

However, it is clear from the text messages Volker knew by Aug. 10 that a renewed investigation of Burisma, the gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board, along with a probe of Ukraine and the Democrats during the 2016 election, were viewed in Kiev as a quid pro quo for the Ukrainian president to secure a date for a White House summit with Trump.Volker also pleaded ignorance of Trump’s July 25 call in which he raised investigating Burisma and Biden with Zelensky, saying he received a general readout of the conversation from people who described it as a “good, congratulatory call.” He said he learned the full details about the call only when it was released late last month.AD

After Trump suggested on the White House lawn Thursday that China investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Romney denounced the president, one of the few Republicans to do so.“By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.”

Only one other GOP senator has criticized Trump’s behavior, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse.“If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that’s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.”

Not surprisingly, the first portion of Luria’s event was devoted to her decision to come out as a leading advocate for impeachment proceedings against Trump after he acknowledged that he pressured Ukraine’s president to conduct investigations into former vice president Joe Biden, one of his potential 2020 rivals.Faced with a more evenly divided crowd in Michigan on Thursday, Slotkin explained her decision to support the impeachment probe — as Trump supporters challenged her interpretation of the Zelensky phone call, questioned whether former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter ought to be investigated, and pressed the former CIA officer on whether she knows the whistleblower who sparked the Ukraine inquiry.“The president is going to say what the president is going to do.”

Trump’s extraordinary public request that China investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — adding to his previous pressure campaign on Ukraine — has sparked divergent reactions among other Republican senators, including over whether the president was being serious when he delivered his plea.Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), the most outspoken of his colleagues, tweeted Friday: “By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.”

Then Thursday, when Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, was meeting with congressional investigators, and President Trump was calling for both Ukraine and China to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, Melania Trump was about as far away from Washington as she could get.Trump quickly hailed Johnson for supposedly routing “Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd.”

Of course, the rough White House transcript of Trump’s call itself unequivocally shows that Trump did pressure Zelensky to “dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent.” Trump told Zelensky that Biden “stopped the prosecution” of his son, which is a lie, and prodded Zelensky to “look into it,” thus pressing him to manufacture a smear of Biden.And even if you question the wisdom of Schiff’s dramatization, it was an accurate representation: Schiff dramatized Trump urging Zelensky to manufacture dirt on Biden, and to contact lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to facilitate this.AD

Trump’s ad tells the whole story

Heck, this ridiculousness is shamelessly and unabashedly on display in the new ad that Trump is running against Biden.pic.twitter.com/U7WxKrO6Kx — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019

The ad’s core claim rests on the idea that the Ukrainian prosecutor Biden wanted ousted was investigating his son, which, again, is a lie.Note that Trump says this ad shows he’s DRAINING THE SWAMP!”

The core deception driving this whole disinformation campaign, of course, is not merely that Trump is lying about what Biden did, but also the fluid and continuing conflation of “investigate Biden” with “investigate corruption.”

AD

Trump is claiming both that what Biden in Ukraine did was corrupt and merits investigation (because Biden is corrupt), and that his calls for an investigation of corruption in Ukraine have nothing whatsoever to do with Biden (because those demands are entirely apolitical).The transcript confirms that his demand was directed at Biden, and even more incoherently and absurdly, Trump himself wants the story to be all about Biden!Given how nutty the president and his top aides sound, there is little wonder most Republican defenders sound desperate to change the subject, to throw accusations at former vice president Joe Biden and otherwise distract from the debacle that threatens to take down Trump and his party.But Hunter Biden … First, the claim that former vice president Biden did anything untoward has been repeatedly, unequivocally debunked.It is not enough just to say that there is “no evidence.” Biden did not do what he is accused of doing (removing a prosecutor to protect his son); he executed the policy of the U.S. government and our allies to push out a prosecutor who was not rooting out corruption.Second, if Biden’s actions were a problem, why did Trump not care until Biden became the front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination and built a double-digit lead in polls against Trump?Third, if Biden were to drop out tomorrow, Trump would still have committed impeachable acts (e.g., withholding taxpayer-funded aid to get help eliminating a rival).The kind-of critics

This group has publicly expressed concern that Trump raised former vice president Joe Biden with foreign leaders, as in a July call with Ukraine’s president or publicly to China last week.By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.All have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republicans, and while Giuliani was running around Ukraine trying to gin up an investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the three were trying to get the Naftogaz CEO removed so that an executive more friendly to their own ambitions to sell liquefied ] natural gas to Ukraine could be installed.… [But] people said they have no indication that Perry explicitly called on Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the issue that has spawned a House impeachment inquiry into Trump.”

Even beyond that, Johnson's argument is weak: Trump's anti-corruption push in his call with Ukraine's president went no further than to ask that Biden and his son be investigated.The interview with Jordan that was so offensive, though, concentrated on an effort to get Jordan to say whether it was appropriate for Trump to have asked China to investigate Biden last week.Why should we not assume that China might try to gain leverage in negotiations by offering Trump some sort of dirt on Biden — however legitimate?You still investigate me.”

Trump, of course, explicitly asked China to investigate Biden.“By the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens,” he said on Oct. 3, as memorialized in a White House transcript, “because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with — with Ukraine.”

AD

There’s no reason to think that Trump was joking in any respect.But there is no indication that Pompeo objected when Trump withheld all of the assistance while Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani — and the president himself — pressed the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.In his July 25 call with Zelensky, Trump described her as “bad” and ominously warned that “she’s going to go through some things.”

Yovanovitch and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, were accused by Giuliani and conservative media figures of trying to protect the Bidens from an investigation by Ukrainian prosectors and working at the behest of George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist.In internal documents turned over to Congress by the State Department inspector general last week, Kent warned in an email to colleagues that Yovanovitch had become the target of a “classic disinformation operation.”

One of the conspiracy theories pushed by Giuliani and a columnist for the news outlet the Hill was that Yovanovitch provided a “do not prosecute list” to Ukrainian officials to protect Biden and others.“I never heard a word of it internally,” the official said of efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, who Trump has alleged intervened when he was vice president to protect his son from a corruption investigation in Ukraine.Ukraine had closed an investigation on the energy company on whose board Hunter Biden served with no finding of wrongdoing.Everything the State Department had done regarding Ukraine, he said, was in the interests of the American people and “at the direction of the president.”

7:00 p.m.: Trump dodges questions on whether he was joking about asking China to investigate the Bidens

At a meeting with senior military officials at the White House Monday evening, Trump repeatedly declined to answer questions from reporters on whether he was joking about asking China to investigate the Bidens.Last Thursday, in remarks outside the White House, Trump publicly urged China to investigate Biden.“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Trump said then.But there is no indication that Pompeo objected when Trump withheld all of the assistance while Giuliani — and the president himself — pressed the government of Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son.“Meanwhile the Biden Family gets pass.”

Kudlow said Monday he wasn’t certain whether Trump was joking when he publicly called upon China to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.It’s not a real request.”

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), echoed Rubio during an appearance Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” Dodging host George Stephanopoulos’s questions about the appropriateness of Trump’s request, he asked, “George, you really think he was serious about thinking that China’s going to investigate the Biden family?”

During his conversation with reporters Monday, a reporter asked Kudlow whether the president can conclusively state that he does not want China to investigate the Bidens.The Turkey story displaced, however temporarily, the issue that has gripped U.S. politics for the past several weeks: Trump’s overtures to Ukraine and then China to dig up dirt on potential 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.The committees are also expecting to hear from the whistleblower who initially set off the Ukrainian firestorm by detailing Trump’s request that Zelensky probe former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.It also raises questions about whether Trump allies were mixing business and politics just as Republicans were calling for a probe of Biden and his son Hunter, who served five years on the board of another Ukrainian energy company, Burisma.”

It's still unclear if the Perry and Giuliani allies were collaborating but “the affair shows how those with ties to Trump and his administration were pursuing business deals in Ukraine that went far beyond advancing the president’s personal political interests.It also raises questions about whether Trump allies were mixing business and politics just as Republicans were calling for a probe of Biden and his son Hunter, who served five years on the board of another Ukrainian energy company, Burisma.” Also notable: “The Trump and Giuliani allies driving the attempt to change the senior management at Naftogaz, however, appear to have had inside knowledge of the U.S. government’s plans in Ukraine.Literally but not seriously: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) echoed another defense Republican lawmakers are making after Trump publicly called on China to investigate Joe Biden and his son: Trump isn't serious.That Ukraine is involved is not merely coincidence: On the same phone call in which Trump made clear to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he wanted Zelensky to get on an investigation of Joe Biden, Trump brought up this conspiracy theory.The findings indicate that public opinion has shifted quickly against Trump and in favor of impeachment proceedings in recent weeks as information has been released about his efforts to pressure Ukrainian government officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 campaign rival, and Biden’s son Hunter.One was a rough transcript of a July 25 telephone call between Trump and newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump asked for “a favor” that included requests for the Ukrainians to look into what happened during the 2016 presidential election and to investigate Biden and his son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.The verdict on the former vice president is more positive, if still mixed: Asked whether Biden would uphold adequate standards for ethics in government should he become president, 47 percent say yes, while 38 percent say no.Those results also split along partisan lines, with 72 percent of Democrats saying Biden would uphold ethical standards, while 63 percent of Republicans say he would not.AD

AD

The poll finds that 15 percent of all Americans say Trump does not uphold adequate ethical standards and that Biden also would not do so if he were president.On the question of the appropriateness of Trump’s request to Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, 45 percent of moderate-to-liberal Republicans and Republicans younger than 40 say it was not appropriate.For months, Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani had been agitating for an investigation into Biden in particular.Good luck!”

That “get to the bottom” likely refers to the theory underpinning Trump’s interest in investigating Biden: a debunked claim that Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire its general prosecutor to shield his own son.We already know from the rough White House transcript of Trump’s call that he pressured Zelensky to “investigate” Joe Biden, based on an entirely fabricated narrative, and to substantiate a fringe conspiracy theory undercutting our own intelligence services’ documentation of Russian interference in our election on Trump’s behalf.— Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Oct. 6, 2019

Never mind that the rough transcript released by the White House of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows that Trump said, “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.”

Johnson says that what Trump really wanted to find out from Ukrainian officials is what happened in 2016.“Neither Hillary Clinton, nor Joe Biden, nor John Podesta, nor George Soros asked me to publish the information from the black ledger.Trump leveraged his position to ask Zelensky to look into former vice president Joe Biden, a possible 2020 opponent of Trump’s.With the exception of Biden and Zelensky, each of the individuals above has been the subject of a request from House investigators, either for documents or for testimony.Attacks against Yovanovitch, however, were consistent with the pro-Trump cause: Rudolph W. Giuliani, a personal attorney for Trump, gave Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a “nine-page document dated March 28 that included a detailed timeline of the Bidens’ dealings in Ukraine and allegations of impropriety against Ms. Yovanovitch, including that she was ‘very close’ to Mr. Biden.” Yovanovitch was removed from her post in May.Now breaking moments ago, we have just obtained, I have it in my hand, a brand-new document from Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani detailing his interview with the Ukrainian prosecutor who was fired at the request of former Vice President Joe Biden.Although the critiques have not all directly addressed the focus of the House investigation — Trump’s request that Ukraine investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — they have added to the case being made by the president’s critics that he is putting U.S. security at risk.And when the institutions don’t work, that is a national security threat.”

She was among 90 national security veterans who signed an open letter published Sunday in support of the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint that Trump had acted improperly in asking the Ukranian president to investigate Biden in a July phone call.Thirteen percent of those who view Trump’s actions in the least favorable light, saying that he asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden to gain a political advantage, nonetheless don’t support impeachment and removal.The swing comes in the aftermath of the revelations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Asked about the call between the two world leaders, 62 percent of American compared to 32 percent felt that Trump's request to investigate the Bidens was inappropriate.On Biden: Despite the onslaught of unsubstantiated attacks from Trump and his allies, out poll found that a majority of voters believe Biden would “uphold adequate standards for ethics in government were he to become president.”

“Those results also split along partisan lines, with 72 percent of Democrats saying Biden would uphold ethical standards, while 63 percent of Republicans say he would not.”

Also: The findings highlight Trump's problems with younger voters and women.Why things are so bad: "Most worrisome to the department is concern that Pompeo did not intervene to protect U.S. diplomats either enlisted by Giuliani to assist his efforts or punished for being insufficiently committed to the cause, according to more than a dozen current and former officials, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter," our colleagues write of the secretary's response to efforts to cajole Ukraine over investigations into Biden."Most worrisome to the department is concern that Pompeo did not intervene to protect U.S. diplomats either enlisted by Giuliani to assist his efforts or punished for being insufficiently committed to the cause, according to more than a dozen current and former officials, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter," our colleagues write of the secretary's response to efforts to cajole Ukraine over investigations into Biden.AD

Volker’s statement also doesn’t deal with a potential quid pro quo, though it does say “at no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden.”

That’s a little difficult to swallow, given that Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani had been pushing for that very publicly for months.The U.S. president has been mired in potential impeachment proceedings after the release of a partial transcript of a July phone call with Ukraine’s Zelensky that appeared to show Trump urging an investigation of the son of domestic political rival Joe Biden.he’s already convicted himself,” Biden said.The letter was the latest escalation in a standoff with Congress, where Democrats are vowing to hold Trump accountable for pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this year to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, at a time when U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been suspended.AD

Joe Biden told a crowd of about a hundred people in New Hampshire that the move was an effort by Trump to “smear” him in order to pick his opponent in 2020.The former vice president said that neither he nor his son did anything illegal, but he did not offer a detailed defense of Hunter Biden’s actions in Ukraine.AD

Before Joe Biden left the venue where his speech was held, Trump took to Twitter to respond.“So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment — and I did nothing wrong,” Trump tweeted.“Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!”

Biden replied in kind: “Thanks for watching,” he tweeted.You?”

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner had earlier come under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors over possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.The younger Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.The probe into Burisma was dormant at the time that Joe Biden, acting as the Obama administration’s point person on Ukraine, sought to have Viktor Shokin, the Ukrainian prosecutor, ousted, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.AD

Biden reminded his audience Wednesday that other Western officials and even some Republican lawmakers agreed that Shokin needed to be replaced because he was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases in Ukraine.AD

On the other hand, Biden said, Trump has repeatedly called on foreign powers — including China, during televised remarks to reporters last week on the White House lawn — to investigate the president’s political enemies.On the campaign trail, Biden has sought to turn the conversation away from Ukraine and instead focus on education and the middle class, even as impeachment has dominated headlines.Still, many Democrats, including Biden partisans, have begun to worry that Trump’s relentless attacks on the former vice president will weigh on the campaign, even if they’re baseless.If Biden is the Democratic nominee, there is fear that Trump could succeed in sowing doubt in voters’ minds.AD

Just hours after Biden spoke, the president’s reelection campaign announced a multi-ad buy — totaling $10 million and focused in early-voting states — that centers on the Bidens and Ukraine.The ad campaign repeats Trump’s unfounded accusation that Biden had leaned on Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor to benefit his son.The 25 July Presidential phone call

What’s confirmed

Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to “initiate or continue an investigation” into Joe Biden.The rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump telling Zelensky: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General [William P. Barr] would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.” (Note: The ellipsis appears in the White House document, suggesting something may have been removed before release.)As we have documented, Trump’s claim that Biden stopped the prosecution of his son Hunter is false.Trump offers praise, however, for an unnamed prosecutor: “A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.” Trump also said: “I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything.”

AD

Trump only discussed “corruption cases” involving Biden and the DNC.The whistleblower noted that the official Ukrainian readout of the call said Trump asked Zelensky to “complete the investigation of corruption cases that have held back cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.” He wrote that, aside from Biden and the 2016 election, “I was told by White House officials that no other ‘cases’ were discussed.” This is confirmed by the rough White House transcript; no other “corruption cases” were discussed.See you tomorrow — kurt.” And Andrey Yermak, an aide to Zelensky, wrote in an Aug. 10 message to Volker: “Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling investigations.” (Burisma Holdings is the Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden had been a board member from 2014 to 2019.)Trump confirmed he had done so but insisted it was unrelated to Biden.In the complaint, the whistleblower does not link the security assistance to Trump’s demands — “I do not know definitively whether the below-mentioned decisions are connected to the broader efforts I describe” — but he notes that U.S. officials “were unaware of a policy rationale.”

That has been confirmed by subsequent reporting, though in one instance a top diplomat privately thought there was a link between the aid and the requested Biden probe: “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” wrote Bill Taylor, chargé d’affaires to Ukraine, in September to Sondland.“The record clearly established that the call was completely appropriate,” Cipollone insists, adding that “there was nothing wrong with the call.”

The rough transcript of the July 25 call released by the White House reveals that Trump directly pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate likely general-election opponent Joe Biden, and to try to invalidate our intelligence services’ conclusion about the Russian attack on our political system on Trump’s behalf.The first of these is based on a fabricated narrative about the Bidens.In that document, which was released by lawmakers, the whistleblower raised concerns about Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pressed for an investigation of Joe Biden, one of his political rivals, and dangled a White House meeting.Last week, House Democrats released texts between Trump diplomats that showed some were concerned the White House was setting up a quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and Ukraine agreeing to investigate Democrats in the 2016 election (and perhaps Trump’s 2020 potential challenger former vice president Joe Biden).I think most of them are holding their breath.”

1:45 p.m.: Biden delivers forceful denunciation of Trump’s actions: ‘He should be impeached’

In a fiery campaign speech in Rochester, N.H., Biden condemned Trump’s actions and declared that the president should be impeached.Biden had previously used caveats when discussing whether Trump’s behavior merited impeachment.“He believes he can and will get away with anything he does,” Biden said.He’s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.”

Biden seized on Trump’s remarks outside the White House last week, where the president publicly urged China to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.Trump did so “in the broad light of day,” Biden said.“It was the third foreign power that we know of that he’s asked in clear, unmistakable language … to interfere” in U.S. democratic proceedings, Biden said, adding that Trump has made overtures to Russia and Ukraine as well.The speech marked Biden’s most combative on the topic of Trump and foreign election interference.“We believe Americans should decide Americans, period,” Biden said.… He has seen no limits to his power, regardless what the Constitution says.”

Biden also took aim at Trump for suggesting that the people who provided information to the whistleblower should be executed.“And by the way, even Nixon released his taxes,” Biden said.That is a long shot, given that Republicans in Congress have largely defended Trump in the face of allegations that he pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son.Hoyer’s assessment came in a statement in response to the White House announcement Tuesday that it would not cooperate with the inquiry into Trump pressing Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.AD

Biden Jr., it says, offered Ukraine $1 billion in aid if the country pushed out the man investigating a company tied to Mr. Biden’s son."But Facebook did not, and on Tuesday, the social network rejected a request from Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign to take it down, foreshadowing a continuing fight over misinformation on the service during the 2020 election as well as the impeachment inquiry into [Trump]...Sondland, who was a hotel magnate and Trump donor before becoming the president’s envoy to the European Union, appears to have played a significant role in trying to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden at Trump’s behest.AD

The Trump administration, in its push to get the Ukrainian government to investigate Burisma Holdings, the firm whose board Hunter Biden served on, was not rooting out corruption in Ukraine.To begin, nearly all of them have endorsed the idea that when the president sent Rudolph W. Giuliani to strong-arm Ukraine into digging up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden, then did some of the strong-arming himself on a call with the Ukrainian president, it was only because Trump cares so much about fighting corruption.AD

AD

And they are positively outraged at the actions of Biden’s son Hunter.For example, notable self-made businessman Eric Trump tweeted his scorn at the amount Hunter Biden was paid for sitting on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.Trump and his consiglieri have undertaken a long-running plot to press Zelensky to undertake “investigations” to magically produce “evidence” validating a conspiracy theory undercutting the confirmed fact that Russia sabotaged the 2016 election to help Trump, and bolstering a fabricated narrative about invented corruption on the part of potential campaign opponent Joe Biden.He says he has an “absolute right” to ask other countries to investigate “corruption,” while saying openly that the corruption he’s talking about involves Biden, thus claiming total authority to solicit foreign help in rigging the next election.The two men, who helped Giuliani investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, were arrested Wednesday night in Virginia, according to a person familiar with the charges.Getting Yovanovitch removed was a project he was working on with his associate Giuliani, in part because Yovanovitch resisted Giuliani’s efforts to strong-arm the Ukrainians into opening an investigation on Joe Biden and his son.Most notably, he repeatedly declined to say whether he was even aware of Trump’s interest in getting Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Q: Were you ever aware of President Trump’s efforts to pressure President Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate the Biden family?Skipping ahead a bit:

Q: Were you ever aware, Mr. Vice President, of the interest in the Bidens, the interest in investigating the Bidens was at least, in part, the reason the aid to Ukraine [was] being held up?PENCE: I never discussed the issue of the Bidens with President Zelensky.Pence said the administration was “entirely focused” on corruption, which one could read as him saying this was not really about Biden.If Pence did not know this was about Biden, you could certainly argue he was being willfully ignorant.AD

So let’s try this again:

Q: But you were aware of the interest in the Bidens being investigated and that being tied to aid to Ukraine being held up?Let me be very clear: The issue of aid and our efforts with regard to Ukraine were from my experience no way connected to the very legitimate concern the American people have about corruption that took place, about things that happened in the 2016 election ... or about the issue that former vice president Biden had his son on the board of a major energy company in Ukraine at a time that Vice President Biden was running the United States’ efforts in Ukraine.He told Zelensky, according to a rough transcript released by the White House, that “there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

But spinning this is one thing; avoiding talking about what he knew and when is quite another.You could make an argument that Pence must have known that this was really about the Bidens and about Trump’s conspiracy theories involving the Russia investigation’s origins, because Giuliani and Trump had made that pretty clear.Both Parnas and Fruman have helped Giuliani investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, though the indictment does not mention Giuliani or suggest that he was part of the alleged crimes.AD

9:00 p.m.: Trump takes aim at Biden, says Democrats’ impeachment effort will ‘produce a backlash at the ballot box’

At a raucous campaign rally — his first since Democrats began their impeachment inquiry — Trump predicted that his political opponents will pay a price at the ballot box, despite polls showing that a majority of the public supports impeaching him.AD

Trump also launched a broadside against Biden and his son, Hunter.Joe Biden “was never considered smart,” Trump said.He was only considered a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass.”

8:30 p.m.: ‘Lock him up!’ Eric Trump says of Hunter Biden

The president’s son, Eric Trump, warmed up the crowd in Minneapolis by taking aim at Biden’s son, Hunter, leading the crowd in a chant of, “Lock him up!”

The phrase is a play on “Lock her up,” a Trump rally favorite.“We don’t need to lock him up,” Eric Trump said of Hunter Biden.— Greg Miller and Greg Jaffe

6:30 p.m.: Biden campaign fundraising off mugshots of Giuliani associates

Biden’s campaign sent out a fundraising email Thursday night featuring the mugshots of Parnas and Fruman.The email includes an MSNBC headline: “Two businessmen who helped Giuliani go after Biden in Ukraine arrested on campaign finance charges.”

“The tide is turning,” the message reads.“These Trump allies who helped Rudy Giuliani try to smear Joe Biden in Ukraine will face a court of law and the Trump Administration is facing an impeachment inquiry.”

6:20 p.m.: Trump dismisses concerns about blocking officials from testifying

In an exchange with reporters outside the White House before departing for Minneapolis, Trump dismissed concerns about his blocking testimony by ambassadors and aides, arguing that allowing such testimony would interfere with his efforts to run the country.Asked whether he was serious when he publicly asked China to investigate Biden last week, Trump didn’t answer directly — but his answer suggested that he did not make the comment in jest.1 p.m.: Trump adviser questions Chinese officials about Biden’s son

Michael Pillsbury, an informal Trump adviser who regularly consults with the president, recently asked Chinese officials questions about Hunter Biden and his business dealings, the conservative scholar said Thursday.Pillsbury claimed he was told that money from the Bank of China went to Hunter Biden’s firm, but that it was difficult to determine exactly how much.He said the Chinese were largely reticent to speak about Biden.Pillsbury said he spoke with Trump just before he went on his trip to China last month, but he said the president didn’t ask him to raise Biden to Chinese officials.The China expert said he’d never spoken with Trump about Hunter Biden but was aware of the president calling for the Chinese to investigate from the South Lawn of the White House last week.Parnas and Fruman have assisted Giuliani with his investigation of Biden and his son in connection with the son’s business dealings in Ukraine.11:30 a.m.: Democrats react to arrests of Giuliani associates

Democrats in Congress started to weigh in on the news that two men who helped Giuliani investigate Biden were arrested on charges of campaign finance violations.“The two Russian born ringleaders of the Ukraine scandal just got arrested for making hundreds of thousands of dollars of illegal contributions to Trump’s re-election.”

11:10 a.m.: Zelensky says he’s open to a ‘joint investigation’

Four hours into a marathon meeting with journalists at a food hall in Kiev, Zelensky said he would be open to a “joint investigation” of Ukraine’s role in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 and of the Burisma gas company, which had recruited Joe Biden’s son Hunter to its board.— Will Englund

10:40 a.m.: Biden campaign presses case for impeachment with new video

A day after Biden delivered a fiery speech in New Hampshire calling for Trump’s impeachment, his campaign continued to press the issue with the release of a video contending that Trump has violated the oath of his office.It then cuts to footage of Trump calling on China to investigate the Bidens from the White House lawn before showing a clip of Biden’s speech Wednesday in Rochester, N.H.

“Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts,” Biden says in the speech.The two men, who helped Giuliani investigate Joe Biden, were arrested Wednesday night in Virginia, according to a person familiar with the charges.9:05 a.m.: Trump seizes on comments by leader of Ukraine

Trump seized on comments by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a Fox News report to claim that talk of impeachment should “immediately end.”

As part of a day-long event with media inside a Kiev food market, Zelensky told reporters there was “no blackmail” when Trump pressed him to investigate the Bidens at a time when U.S. military aid was suspended.5:45 a.m.: Biden campaign slams New York Times for op-ed by conservative author behind Ukraine claims

As Trump has lobbed unsubstantiated and false claims of international corruption at Biden and his son, he’s often turned to one source for ammunition: conservative author Peter Schweizer.So when the New York Times ran an op-ed on Wednesday written by Schweizer about the Bidens, the Democratic presidential candidate’s campaign cried foul.In a letter sent to New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, Biden’s campaign called Schweizer a “discredited right-wing polemicist” and suggested the op-ed was part of a larger pattern of “journalistic malpractice.”

“Are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, wrote in the Wednesday letter.In a July 25 phone call, as the United States withheld military assistance to the country, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate allegations relating to the son of former vice president Joe Biden, as well as a discredited theory about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.During a call in late July, Trump asked that Zelensky and Ukraine investigate former vice president Joe Biden.WATCH: VP Mike Pence repeatedly dodges questions from @NBCNews' @VaughnHillyard about whether he had knowledge of Trump's Ukraine plot pic.twitter.com/xLm9D8f3Aq — TheBeat w/Ari Melber (@TheBeatWithAri) October 10, 2019

The Campaign

BIDEN PUNCHES BACK, COMES OUT FOR IMPEACHMENT: "Former vice president Joe Biden made his most direct call yet for [Trump’s] impeachment, just hours after Trump tweeted that the Democratic-led inquiry was tainted with political bias and should be terminated 'for the good of the Country,'" our colleagues Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Felicia Sonmez report.he’s already convicted himself,” Biden said.he’s already convicted himself,” Biden said.This line: "We all laughed when he said he could stand on the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away it," Biden said.Trump appeared to be watching: Before Biden left the venue where his speech was held, Trump took to Twitter to respond.(Biden later chided him in his reply.)And he's taking the message to voters: "Just hours after Biden spoke, the president’s reelection campaign announced a multi-ad buy — totaling $10 million and focused in early-voting states — that centers on the Bidens and Ukraine," our colleagues write."The ad campaign repeats Trump’s unfounded accusation that Biden had leaned on Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor to benefit his son.Asked their views about what Trump did — specifically, ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden — most respondents said that the request was “very” or “extremely” troubling.It’s an argument that suffers from two distinct problems: There’s not strong evidence that Biden was engaged in anything close to corruption, and there’s no evidence that Trump has put a focus on corruption anywhere that a prominent Democrat wasn’t involved.This suggests, perhaps, that some supporters accept the idea that Trump wasn’t looking to undermine Biden specifically.Unearthing additional evidence suggesting that Trump’s goal was solely to undercut Biden could presumably increase the number of people who consider Trump’s actions out of bound.The once lauded New York mayor was an important player in the push for a politically driven investigation by Kiev into a potential Trump opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, and Biden’s son Hunter.“This appears to be a threat of retaliation for political reasons, which is both shocking and inappropriate.”

Another former ambassador to Ukraine, Steven Pifer, described Trump’s request to Ukraine for “derogatory information” on Biden as “an abuse of power.”

Pifer’s email added this ominous prospect: “I have seen nothing quite as blatant as this but have to wonder if there are other questions where the White House has subverted American interests to the President’s.”

Earlier this week, the White House blocked the House appearance of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.The Morning Consult/Politico poll finds that “50 percent of registered voters surveyed would support the Senate’s removing Trump from office, while 43 percent oppose the president’s removal.”

In the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll reports that "47 percent of Americans believe the allegations that Trump requested Ukraine’s president to look into the Bidens are either ‘quite serious’ or ‘extremely serious.’ That includes 73 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and even 21 percent of Republicans.” In the same survey, a clear majority, 53 percent, think he has not been honesty and trustworthy about Ukraine; only 38 percent believe he has been.The whistleblower alleged that Trump improperly asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a potential Democratic opponent in the 2020 election.About four hours into the session, Zelensky conceded that he would be open to a “joint investigation” of Ukraine’s role in the 2016 U.S. election and of the Burisma gas company, which had recruited former vice president Joe Biden’s son to its board.AD

Sondland had inserted himself as a go-between as Zelensky sought a White House meeting and Trump sought help investigating Joe and Hunter Biden.That’s it.”

“I’m not very happy” that the July 25 conversation came out, he said, because it damages diplomatic relations and “reduces the space for tactical maneuvers to zero.”

But if this is an attempt to put all the Trump-Biden-Putin-Donetsk-Burisma-Giuliani controversies behind him once and for all, well, his occasionally testy exchanges suggest that it’snot too likely.And Prince’s personal politics would seem an unlikely match for the GOP president, who used his Thursday night rally to once again slam refugees and former vice president Joe Biden.AD

The House sought these records months before the beginning of its recent impeachment inquiry, related to Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.Smith called Carlson “repugnant” for not defending Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano when a guest on Carlson’s program called Napolitano “a fool” for criticizing Trump’s efforts to gain damaging information on Democratic rival Joe Biden from the president of Ukraine.The person said Sondland believed his testimony would be “generally helpful” in that Sondland did not fully understand that an investigation Trump wanted Ukraine to conduct was into former vice president Joe Biden and his son, and thus would benefit Trump’s reelection campaign.“They didn’t understand this directly related to something personal, like dirt on the Bidens,” the person said.On his Fox News program Wednesday night, Carlson followed up those sentiments with these sentiments: “The president has already asked half-facetiously Ukraine and China to look into the Bidens, maybe he should check with the Kazakhs, too.The advice on Kazakhstan was based on Carlson’s contention that, according to court filings reviewed by “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, had dealings in Kazakhstan through the same business partner — Devon Archer — who’s involved in the controversy surrounding Ukraine.“Archer and Hunter Biden have a business relationship that centers on more than simply Ukraine.And according to court filings reviewed by this show, Archer and Biden’s firm, Rosemont Seneca, also did business with Kazakhstan’s Sovereign Wealth Fund.”

AD

As for the claim that Trump “half-facetiously” petitioned Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens, that’s a recycled talking point that Republican apologists for Trump have floated on public-affairs shows.The main problem with the talking point is the not-at-all-joking demeanor of the president in remarks last Thursday: “China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine," said the president.He also repeatedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden in a July 25 call, an incident that’s fueling an impeachment inquiry.“Hunter, you’re a loser.”

Mocking Hunter Biden’s lack of public appearances, Trump bellowed: “Whatever happened to Hunter?Where’s Hunter?”

Trump attacked the press for fact checking the allegations he has leveled against the Bidens noting they are often described as unsubstantiated.Trump, who has fixated on the former vice president as a potential 2020 foe since Biden entered the race in April, is embroiled in an escalating battle with House Democrats as they pursue an impeachment inquiry over Trump pressuring the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over what Trump claims were the younger Biden’s corrupt business dealings in the country.AD

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.During the raucous rally — interrupted frequently by pro-Trump chants, cheers and boos as protesters were hauled out of the arena — the president ramped up his attacks on Biden and paid scant attention to other potential 2020 Democratic challengers, even as the former vice president has faltered lately in polling.Biden “was never considered smart,” Trump said.“I’d love to run against him, to be honest,” Trump said of Biden.Biden responded late Thursday after a town hall meeting in Los Angeles, writing in a Twitter post addressed to Trump: “I spent my night at the HRC [Human Rights Campaign] forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves.AD

AD

The State Department blocked Sondland last week from appearing before three panels focused on Trump’s efforts to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden at a time when U.S. military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.His comments come the day after his Minneapolis rally, when Trump leveled some of his most personal attacks yet against Biden and his family, mixing curse words with unsubstantiated claims.The speaker then criticized Trump’s recent public statements — particularly about Biden and his other potential Democratic opponents — saying they’ve become especially acerbic.In explaining her departure, she acknowledged months of criticisms by President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had accused her of privately badmouthing the president and seeking to protect the interests of Biden and his son who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.House Democrats launched an inquiry just over two weeks ago, focusing on Trump’s pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son.Messages that were released publicly show that the administration sought a promise from Ukrainian leaders to investigate the 2016 election and the energy firm, Burisma, that had paid Hunter Biden to sit on its board.During a rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, Trump leveled some of his most personal attacks yet against Biden and his family, highlighting unsubstantiated claims about his potential 2020 rival’s son and using profanity to describe Biden’s tenure as vice president.Among other things, Trump mocked Hunter Biden’s personal problems, including his discharge from the Navy after he tested positive for cocaine use.“Hunter, you’re a loser.”

Joe Biden went on Twitter after the rally, referring to his appearance at a town hall hosted by the Human Rights Campaign and CNN on LGBTQ issues.“I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves,” Biden tweeted.Since House Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry just over two weeks ago, Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her top lieutenants have coalesced around a plan to focus on Trump’s pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.A new memo from the original whistleblower, obtained by the New York Times, says that a White House official who was on Trump’s July phone call with Ukraine’s president described the call as “crazy” and “frightening” and “completely lacking in substance related to national security.”

WEDNESDAY: Biden backs removing Trump, Pence struggles to answer questions

Former vice president Joe Biden says Trump should be impeached “for shooting holes in the Constitution.” He had been a notable holdout in the 2020 race on calling for impeachment.He met with Ukraine’s president in September, and when pressed by an NBC News reporter, he did not say what he did or didn’t know about Trump’s attempts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.“If Pence did not know this was about Biden,” writes The Fix’s Aaron Blake, “you could certainly argue he was being willfully ignorant."There, he lambastes Democrats over the impeachment inquiry (“a brazen attempt to overthrow our government”) and launches vicious personal attacks at both Joe Biden (”never considered smart") and his son Hunter Biden (“a loser”).Yovanovitch tells House investigators that Trump had her ousted over concerns she was loyal to the Bidens, despite being a career diplomat -- an allegation she denies..The two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who had been helping Giuliani investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden, were arrested Wednesday evening at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington, D.C., where they had one-way tickets on a flight out of the country.” Not exactly fighting corruption, eh?That the whistleblower was aware of the discussion of the server, aware of the discussion of the prosecutor, aware of the discussion of former vice president Joe Biden captures the details salient to the issue at hand: what Trump wanted from the Ukrainian president.AD

AD

“There is simply no evidence of what House Democrats have made the central claim of their impeachment inquiry,” Strassel writes, “that Mr. Trump engaged in a ‘quid pro quo’ by withholding aid to Ukraine unless it ‘opened an investigation’ into former vice president Joe Biden.”

This, my friends, is called a “straw man.”

When Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the impeachment inquiry, the focus was on Trump’s request for political assistance from a foreign leader, something that Trump himself admits having done.Her critique was broader than just that, but it was clearly not an effort centered on an explicit quid pro quo of aid for a Biden probe.There was a text message released in which Trump’s Ukraine envoy prepared a Zelensky aide for the call by directly tying Zelensky’s desire for a White House meeting to the Biden probe.Schiff then depicted what happened on the call accurately, by mimicking Trump pressing Zelensky to produce dirt on Biden, and directing Zelensky to talk to Attorney General William P. Barr and personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani to carry it out.AD

The Financial Times reported that Michael Pillsbury, one of Trump’s China advisers, said he had received potentially negative information on Hunter Biden during a visit to Beijing.Nor are Democrats readying a new ­impeachment probe of Trump’s request last week that China dig up dirt on Biden, which one official said was a public declaration and didn’t need to be investigated.Recent reports, the Democratic investigators wrote, have “raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani’s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election.”

AD

AD

Democrats also subpoenaed two Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, for documents pertaining to how they worked to connect Trump’s attorney to Ukrainians claiming to have damaging information on the Bidens.After Trump said last week that along with Ukraine, China should investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the younger Biden’s business dealings, several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said the president was joking.“You watch what the president said: He’s not saying, ‘China, investigate,’ ” he said during an interview Monday on “Fox and Friends.” What Trump told reporters regarding China was: “They should investigate the Bidens.”

AD

Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is deeply involved in the controversy over the administration’s policies toward Ukraine, has often resorted to exaggeration when defending the president or condemning Democrats.Among the assertions from the whistleblower that have proved accurate: that Trump asked Zelensky to “initiate or continue an investigation” into former vice president Biden, a potential 2020 rival; that Trump told Zelensky to speak with Giuliani and Barr about the matter; and that Trump raised the debunked theory that Hillary Clinton’s email server may be in Ukraine during the conversation.Over the last few weeks, we have learned: Trump ordered aid to Ukraine halted and, to any reasonable observer, was linking that aid and a meeting to Ukraine’s assistance in manufacturing dirt on Democratic presidential contender and former vice president Joe Biden, and in pursuing his asinine conspiracy theory that Ukraine — and not Russia — interfered in the 2016 election; Trump refused to allow witnesses and documents to be produced in response to subpoenas necessary for the House impeachment inquiry; Trump publicly threatened a whistleblower; and, according to a Bloomberg report (in an echo of his attempt to get former FBI director James Comey to go easy on fired NSA Michael Flynn):

President Donald Trump pressed then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to help persuade the Justice Department to drop a criminal case against an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who was a client of Rudy Giuliani, according to three people familiar with the 2017 meeting in the Oval Office.And ever since the first stories broke three weeks ago about Trump’s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to help find damaging information about the Bidens and about Hillary Clinton, there has been some version of the Minnesota performance virtually every day.To some who have long been critical of the president, Trump’s actions with regard to Ukraine and his call to China to launch its own investigation of Biden and his son have brought a heightened sense of alarm.The core issue in the impeachment inquiry remains Trump’s willingness to pressure Ukraine to go after political rivals, including one, Biden, who could become his 2020 challenger, a project in which he allowed his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to circumvent the State Department and the National Security Council to run a shadow operation.He likened the whistleblower to a spy and called Biden and his son Hunter “corrupt.” “I think Biden has never been a smart guy, and he’s less smart now than he ever was.” He ended that encounter by calling the media “the enemy of the people,” adding, “Have a good day everybody.In the news conference, Jeff Mason of Reuters asked what Trump wanted about Biden from the Ukrainians.But then came revelations, beginning with a whistleblower report, that Trump had pressured Ukraine officials to investigate a top 2020 Democratic rival, former vice president Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.Hunter Biden is taking a step that no other prospective presidential adult child in recent memory has undertaken.AD

Bloomberg notes:

Biden’s pledge to avoid foreign work if his father wins the White House sets him apart from Trump’s children, who have continued working with foreign business partners from Dubai to Indonesia and India while his father sits in the White House.And we’re supposed to be concerned that Hunter Biden, whose father is no longer in office, is serving on a Chinese company’s board?AD

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been among the most vocal defenders of the Bidens (Democratic candidates who prefer to lie low and reap the benefit of Trump’s attacks against their primary opponents behave shamefully), made the point with exceptional clarity on CNN’s State of the Union:

.@PeteButtigieg: "Even though there's been no accusation of wrongdoing, [Hunter Biden's] doing something just to make sure there's not even the appearance of a conflict of interest, while in the White House the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interest."AD

Biden’s campaign has yet to call for the Trump children to take the same pledge as Hunter Biden, but it really should consider going on offense.AD

Tuesday’s debate is the perfect forum for Democrats to end the double standard that serves to shelter the Trump clan from scrutiny for continuing to perpetrate massive conflicts and self-dealing while targeting Joe Biden and his son, who have done the right thing in promising to raise the bar on ethics if Biden wins.It would be a good idea for all the Democratic candidates to promise that their own adult children will follow Hunter Biden’s example.Hunter Biden served, starting in 2014, as a paid board member for a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, at a time when his father was shepherding U.S. policy in that country, including advocating for increased gas production.AD

AD

Trump asked Ukraine’s president in a July 25 phone call to “look into” the Bidens, referring to allegations that Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor who was probing the company where Hunter Biden served as a director.In recent days, Trump has sought to highlight questions about Hunter Biden, asking on Twitter and at a campaign rally last week, “Where is Hunter Biden?”

AD

Hunter Biden’s lawyer, George Mesires, said in the Sunday statement that his client has been the subject of allegations that bear “little resemblance to the public record.”

AD

Mesires did not say how much Hunter Biden earned in his work for Burisma.Mesires said Hunter Biden was paid nothing for his service as a director for the Chinese company and has yet to make a profit from his 2017 purchase of a 10 percent stake in that company, which he said is worth $430,000.Mesires said that if Joe Biden is elected president, Hunter Biden will abide by any ethics laws imposed by his father’s administration and will not work for foreign companies.AD

“Hunter makes the following commitment: Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests,” Mesires said.“In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.”

AD

While Mesires said Hunter Biden “intends to resign” from the Chinese company’s board of directors by Oct. 31, he did not say whether his client would sell his stake in the company.Trump also has asked China to investigate the Bidens.As Trump tells it, Hunter Biden “walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund, and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China, and he’s there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two.I think that’s a horrible thing.” Hunter Biden’s lawyer, however, said his client has yet to make a penny.AD

Joe Biden, speaking to reporters in Altoona, Iowa, said that he had not seen the statement from his son’s lawyer before it was released, but he said he supported it, calling his son a “man of integrity.” He said that his son “did not realize” that “the appearance of it” would raise questions, apparently referring to his son’s work for companies in Ukraine and China while he was vice president.He said that he and his son had done nothing wrong but that his son would avoid questions by not taking such positions during a Biden administration.AD

“If I am your president, your next president, I am going to build on the squeaky clean White House that we had in the Obama-Biden administration,” Joe Biden said.End of story.”

Some analysts said Hunter Biden created at least the appearance of a conflict of interest by taking his board position at BHR while his father was dealing with China policy.Herrera noted that Hunter Biden was not required to report that he was a board member of a company connected to the Chinese government when he joined BHR in 2013.Even if it is not illegal, it creates an appearance of conflict of interest and in some cases is a conflict of interest.”

AD

Much about Hunter Biden’s China dealings is unknown because many records of the company are not public, and he has declined interview requests to discuss his work for the company.At the time, Archer was a partner in an investment company with Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz, the stepson of former secretary of state John F.

During Hunter Biden’s time as a director of BHR, the company made several deals that have drawn attention from Republicans.Decisions by the committee are confidential, and no records are publicly available about how a decision was approved or whether Hunter Biden played any role.Two days later, Joe Biden criticized Trump for being soft on China, citing what he called that country’s “human rights abuses that are staggering, cause for enormous concern,” including Muslims who are “imprisoned in so-called reeducation camps.” He made no reference to BHR’s connection to the Chinese company, or the Trump administration’s blacklisting of it.Mesires said in his statement that “Hunter played no role in directing or making BHR’s investments,” leaving it unclear what Biden did in his position.Megvii said in a statement that Hunter Biden is not a direct investor in the BHR funds that own a stake in the company.“It is our understanding, through conversations with BHR, that Biden has not been involved in any aspect of BHR’s investment into Megvii,” according to the statement.It illustrates, said veteran campaign reformer Fred Wertheimer, how Citizens United “created a clear path for unlimited amounts of foreign money to enter our political system.”

The arrests also make clear that Trump’s July 25 phone call seeking help from Ukraine’s president to smear Joe Biden was part of a larger structure of corruption that is the hallmark of the Trump presidency.One big reason for the uptick: The uproar over Trump’s phone call with Ukraine’s president on July 25 — in which he urged an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election rival — and the ensuing House impeachment inquiry.Another false claim — that Biden forced the resignation of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he was investigating his son Hunter — just barely missed the cutoff for inclusion.AD

Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican most outspoken about Trump’s conduct, is “Pompous Senator.”

During the Oct. 2 news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, Trump acted like a schoolyard bully when Jeff Mason of Reuters pressed him repeatedly on a question he did not want to answer: what, specifically, Trump sought from Zelensky during a controversial phone call in which he asked him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Now facing impeachment over a problematic call with his Ukrainian counterpart — where he asked Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political rival as “a favor” — Trump has rejected the notion that his conversation with Zelensky was anything but “perfect.” Instead, he has accused Biden and his son Hunter of corrupt dealings of their own with Ukraine, despite little evidence of wrongdoing.He also turned on a member of his own party, Romney, after the Utah senator was critical of him for calling on both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden.The committees pursuing the investigation have remained at work — securing a string of lengthy closed-door interviews with current and former diplomats, subpoenaing crucial documents and otherwise showing progress toward elucidating Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son at a time when U.S. military aid was being withheld from the country.Kurt Volker, the former special representative to Ukraine, gave the committees text messages depicting State Department officials coordinating with Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to leverage a public promise of an investigation into the Bidens for a meeting between Trump and Ukraine’s new president.“In order for the president’s [stonewalling] strategy to work, he needs willing partners among those … in the administration, and not all of them are willing to go along with it.”

As the committees heard testimony last week, federal prosecutors in New York indicted two close Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who played a role in driving Trump’s interest in Ukraine by pushing theories about the country’s involvement in the 2016 election and the service of Biden’s son Hunter on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.The campaign-finance indictment from Trump’s own Justice Department has undercut Giuliani’s credibility and complicated White House attempts to promote a counternarrative focused on Biden’s alleged wrongdoing.While the younger Biden did not say anything objectionable in an interview with ABC broadcast Tuesday morning, I am at a loss to explain the strategy involved in putting him up for examination and thereby giving a lift to President Trump’s false equivalence.Moreover, Hunter Biden acknowledged and underscored the one legitimate area of criticism.Not in any way whatsoever.”

Perhaps we can feel a bit sorry for a man who has had his share of personal issues and knows he gets used because his last name is Biden, but why in the world are we talking about Hunter Biden when the real issue is first, Trump’s impeachable conduct, and second, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump’s gross corruption in making money while working in the White House.Seriously, why has Joe Biden not gone on offense there, demanding they divest or leave the White House?Biden should come out blazing.His answer might go something like this: “Let me get this straight: You’re asking about my son who has been repeatedly exonerated of any wrongdoing and my own work fighting Ukrainian corruption while the guy in the White House solicited help from Ukraine in violation of campaign laws and wanted them to manufacture dirt on my son and help prove his wackadoodle theory that the Democratic National Committee server was in Ukraine?” Biden might continue, “I’m going to talk about the most serious betrayal of American democracy and the Constitution in U.S. history, a president not only going to a foreign country to interfere in our elections but also to extort help using the promise of a meeting and release of aid.”

Biden would do well to give a mini-course in the impeachment revelations.(Such as: “All around him people knew this was wrong and tried to hide evidence of a disastrous phone call.”) He should reiterate that Trump is doing all this because he sees Biden as the one Democrat exempt from “socialist” accusations whose ties to working-class voters is second to none.He might also dare his opponents to pledge their own kids would take the same pledge of noninvolvement in overseas business as Hunter Biden has.In sum, Joe Biden’s record of honorable public service evidences no whiff of actual wrongdoing.He can go a long way Tuesday night toward impressing voters that Trump is right in fearing Biden as the Democratic nominee.That’s where I made the mistake,” Biden said in the exclusive interview.Not in any way whatsoever.”

The younger Biden’s overseas business dealings have consumed the last few weeks of Joe Biden’s third bid for the presidency, and they have been raised repeatedly by President Trump in apparent efforts to tarnish his chief rival and sidetrack an impeachment inquiry.Joe Biden and his son have both denied any wrongdoing.Beginning in 2014, Hunter Biden served as a paid board member of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, at the same time that Joe Biden, then vice president, was shepherding U.S. policy toward that country.Hunter Biden also later worked as a director and a part-owner of a Chinese investment company.AD

On July 25, Trump asked Ukraine’s president to “look into” the Bidens, particularly whether, as vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to get ammunition against Biden.AD

As the House’s impeachment inquiry continues, Trump and his supporters have accused the Bidens of corruption — in tweets, at a profanity-laced campaign rally in Minneapolis and in an ad blitz worth millions of dollars.The claims are untrue and have been largely debunked, but it remains unclear how much the quagmire of foreign names and overseas business dealings might affect voters who attend Trump rallies and Biden town halls.Even as the president is enmeshed in an impeachment inquiry, Trump and his allies have repeated false claims and argued that Joe Biden is corrupt, including in an advertisement that CNN and other networks have refused to air.AD

At the Minneapolis rally Thursday night, Trump attacked the Bidens in crass, personal terms, highlighting the unsubstantiated claims about Hunter Biden and using profanity to describe Joe Biden’s tenure as vice president.“Hunter, you’re a loser.”

In the ABC News interview, Hunter Biden said that he had been on several boards, including Amtrak’s.As a result, the Bidens have been put on the defensive as the former vice president faces a fire hose of accusations.AD

And questions have remained about Hunter Biden’s actions: particularly whether his overseas business associates were more drawn to his legal and technical expertise or to making a connection to his powerful father.The controversy hits at the image Joe Biden is presenting of himself as he tries to become president.On the campaign trail, he repeatedly tells voters he spent decades as the poorest member of the U.S. Senate and boasts of the nickname earned by his modest income: “Middle Class Joe.” Hunter Biden has refused to say how much he made as a board member for Burisma, but some reports say he was paid as much as $50,000 a month.AD

A statement released Sunday morning by Hunter Biden’s attorney said he had stepped down from the Burisma board and planned to step down from the board of BHR, a Chinese limited-liability company that aims to invest Chinese capital outside China.AD

The statement did not specify what will happen to an equity stake valued at $420,000 that Hunter Biden holds in the Chinese company.To avoid conflicts or the appearance of conflict if his father is elected president, Hunter Biden said he would restrict overseas business activity and not work on behalf of foreign-owned companies.“Hunter makes the following commitment: Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests,” the attorney, George Mesires, said in the statement.“In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.”

Joe Biden, speaking to reporters hours after his son’s statement was released, emphasized that numerous news organizations have found that he and his son did nothing wrong.He said his son’s statement was an example of Hunter Biden doing the right thing and that it was not issued in concert with the campaign.Joe Biden, who has called for Trump’s impeachment, said the president’s actions were motivated by fear that Biden would “beat him like a drum” in the general election.“And I can tell you now, if I am your president, the next president, I’m going to build on the squeaky-clean, transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House,” he said.End of story.”

Crucially, this eruption came after a meeting in early July at which Sondland made it clear that the goal of this shadow campaign was to get Ukraine to revive investigations into Burisma, the company on whose board Biden’s son Hunter sat.This confirmed for Bolton that the goal was to leverage Ukraine into acting as Trump’s weapon against Biden — that is, by manufacturing smears designed to debilitate him in the 2020 election.That transcript shows Trump explicitly naming Joe Biden while demanding investigations.In his own words, Trump has flatly said that Ukraine “should investigate the Bidens.”

Hunter Biden, whose tenure on the company, Burisma Holdings, began in 2014, said he didn’t foresee that his work would become central to a political controversy.Trump and Giuliani have pressed the idea that Joe Biden’s efforts as vice president to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor was tied to the fact that he had examined the company.“What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this, this ridiculous conspiracy idea, which has … been completely debunked by everyone,” Hunter Biden said.“Rarely has a presidential decision resulted so immediately in what his own party leaders have described as disastrous consequences for American allies and interests.”

There is no exact transcript of the conversation — in which Trump urged an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election rival — as the summary was cobbled together from notes by White House officials.Biden’s name came up twice in the call, not seven times.So there were a number of requests — ABC News counted eight — but not seven about Biden.Trump also did not request that Zelenksy “make up dirt” on Biden.In what surely will be long-remembered phrases, she reportedly testified that Bolton had called Giuliani a “hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up” and had declared “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and [acting chief of staff Mick] Mulvaney are cooking up.” Aside from adding some colorful commentary to the Giuliani-Trump skullduggery, Bolton’s reported statements confirm that pressure on Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden was not part of official U.S. policy (i.e.The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, the energy company, and Biden — something that made Bolton go “ballistic” after the meeting, the official said.In their July 25 call, Trump appeared to pressure the Ukrainian leader to launch probes into the 2016 U.S. election and the son of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden.2 ranking diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, of trying to protect the Bidens from an investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors.Giuliani and the Hill had alleged earlier this year that Yovanovitch provided a “do not prosecute list” to Ukrainian officials to protect the Bidens and other allies.AD

Kent is one of more than a half-dozen current and former State officials who have been summoned by Democrats as part of their probe into Trump’s bid to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on the Biden family — and sideline State officials who did not take well to that task.The subpoena seeks records about Sessions’s dealings with Giuliani and two business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who before their arrest had been helping Giuliani investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden.The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, the energy company, and Biden — something that made Bolton go “ballistic” after the meeting, the official said.Mulvaney also tolerated meetings between Trump and Giuliani at a time when Giuliani was brazenly declaring in interviews his intent to enlist Kiev in efforts to substantiate conspiracy theories about the 2016 election and revive seemingly dormant probes that could prove damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.He then asked for “a favor, though,” pushing Zelensky to revive an investigation of an energy company, Burisma, that had paid Biden’s son Hunter to serve on its board.He watched as some veteran diplomats were berated for their perceived disloyalty to the Trump administration and as experts on Ukraine were sidelined to satisfy the president’s political desires in pursuing an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.Then, in late September as McKinley was with Pompeo in New York for the U.N. General Assembly meeting, news broke of Trump’s pressure on Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens.Other human beings don’t have inherent dignity; their worth is determined solely in terms of what they can do for the person who is the betrayer.”

Joe Biden

Democratic candidate

The former vice president has centered his third presidential run on his vow to oust President Trump.In September, Biden’s name became part of the House’s impeachment inquiry of Trump, who acknowledged asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.Neither Biden nor his son has been accused of wrongdoing.Biden, 76, has been a force in Democratic politics for nearly five decades, representing Delaware in the Senate for 36 years before serving two terms under President Barack Obama.Besides being erratic (to put it kindly) and consumed with conspiracy theories, Giuliani was also pursuing not the interests of the United States but two other goals: getting dirt to smear Joe Biden in order to help Trump get reelected, and finding ways to make money for himself.Burisma is the company on whose board Hunter Biden sat, and we know full well that any discussion of “corruption” coming from Trump and Giuliani was not about fighting corruption per se — you’d have trouble finding two people who care less about actual corruption — but about using anti-corruption investigations as a tool to discredit Biden.But then Sondland makes a big claim:

But I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President’s 2020 reelection campaign

Sondland isn’t the first to make this claim.Energy Secretary Rick Perry also told the Wall Street Journal this week that he had never heard Trump or Giuliani talk about Ukraine investigating the Bidens.In the weeks leading up to that May 23 White House briefing, Giuliani’s and even Trump’s interest in spotlighting the Bidens’ actions in Ukraine were hardly a secret.To wit:

So according to Sondland, despite all of that, as of May 23 he “did not understand … that Mr. Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son.” He even says Giuliani mentioned the Ukrainian company that employed Hunter Biden, Burisma Holdings, in August, but “I did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma.”

Giuliani, a decision that made Sondland uncomfortable but one he still carried out.” He further claimed at the time to have been in the dark about Giuliani’s role in scrounging for dirt on former vice president Joe Biden, a questionable defense, given Giuliani’s many public statements boasting that this was precisely what he was doing.And that is absolutely appropriate.”

The fact that Mulvaney sought to separate the now-acknowledged quid pro quo from the issue of the Bidens is also telling.Sondland was testifying behind closed doors about Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden at a time when nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.Schiff embellished the transcript of the July phone call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.Mulvaney maintained Thursday that Trump’s request of Ukraine was unrelated to the Bidens, even though Trump mentioned the former vice president in his July phone call with Zelensky.“The money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden,” Mulvaney said.The briefing comes as Mulvaney has emerged as a key facilitator of the campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.“It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president’s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani.”

Sondland said he did not understand “until much later that Mr. Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president’s 2020 reelection campaign.”

Sondland said that he and others were “disappointed by the President’s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani.”

7 a.m.: Donald Trump Jr. slammed for attacking Hunter Biden over nepotism

Donald Trump Jr. listened Wednesday night as Fox News host Sean Hannity scrutinized Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings, suggesting that the son of a former vice president only had opportunities in other countries because “they’re really buying favor with the father.”

“Of course they are,” Trump Jr. chimed in.“Now, let’s be clear, I’m not defending Hunter Biden,” Noah said on his show Wednesday.“He literally said the thing the president and everyone else said did not happen.”

Trump has repeatedly claimed there was “no quid pro quo” in his dealings with Ukraine, which also included a request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Pelosi later clarified that Trump actually called her a “third-grade politician.”

It was the two party leaders’ first face-to-face meeting since Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, arguing that Trump betrayed his oath of office by pressuring Zelensky to dig up dirt on former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.“I was convinced that this would also have a serious impact on Foreign Service morale and the integrity of our work overseas.”

Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union — who is described in testimony as one of the “three amigos” designated to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens — is scheduled to testify Thursday.Graham has also promised to invite Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to testify about allegations against the Bidens in Ukraine, which have not been substantiated.Perry also said he never heard the president, any of his appointees, Mr. Giuliani or the Ukrainian regime discuss the possibility of specifically investigating" former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.It’s Trump’s request for an investigation into the Bidens during a July call with [Ukranian President Volodymyr] Zelensky that sparked the impeachment inquiry.But there’s another reason this walkback is highly implausible: The timeline of events shows that again and again, over many months, Trump and his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani publicly talked about this very conspiracy theory or variants and offshoots of it — in some cases calling on Ukraine to investigate them — along with another set of lies designed to debilitate potential opponent Joe Biden.In early April, he floated a version of it on Fox News, and also aired the debunked idea that Biden improperly tried to get a prosecutor in Ukraine removed to protect his son.AD

In early May, Giuliani talked extensively to the New York Times about his elaborate plan to get Ukraine to investigate yet another aspect of the conspiracy theory — the debunked notion that Ukraine colluded with Hillary Clinton by digging dirt on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort — as well as the Biden angle.AD

Later in May, Trump railed on Fox News about the debunked Biden narrative.Giuliani publicly demanded Ukraine investigate the Bidens in May and in June.And on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump explicitly pushed for investigations into the Crowdstrike and Biden theories, and not for an investigation of “corruption.”

The bottom line

Given this long-running public obsession with getting Ukraine to investigate this bundle of theories, it’s simply impossible to believe Trump withheld the military aid only because of a generic concern about corruption.He admitted to House investigators that Giuliani, acting at Trump’s direction, demanded that Ukraine publicly commit to investigate the debunked Crowdstrike and Biden theories as a condition for a White House meeting.George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden’s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition.Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people.But when Kent raised the issue with Biden’s office, he was told the then-vice president didn’t have the “bandwidth” to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony.AD

AD

The testimony by Kent offers a reminder that as Democrats probe President Trump’s alleged actions in pressuring Ukraine to dig up compromising information on Biden, the impeachment inquiry also threatens to keep alive questions about the former vice president’s handling of his son’s foreign work at a precarious moment for his 2020 presidential campaign.Kent, who also testified about how Trump’s associates raised unfounded allegations about the former ambassador to Ukraine, is the first known example of a career diplomat who raised concerns internally in the Obama administration about Hunter Biden’s board position.The Washington Post has previously reported that there had been discussions among Biden’s advisers about whether his son’s Ukraine work would be perceived as a conflict of interest, and that one former adviser had been concerned enough to mention it to Biden, though the conversation was brief.During his testimony this week, Kent did not name the Biden staffer he said he communicated with, according to people familiar with his remarks.AD

AD

Although many of Trump’s charges regarding Hunter Biden have been unfounded, the elder Biden has faced questions about why he didn’t anticipate concerns about potential conflicts of interest as he took a leading role in carrying out U.S. policy toward Ukraine.Polls show Biden with an advantage over Trump in a potential general election matchup, and Biden has sought in recent days to focus attention on the actions of a president many Democrats see as corrupt and unfit for office.A former senior Biden national security aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, had no recollection of hearing about Kent’s concerns, and also never heard a concern raised by the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the time.The first time the aide recalls Hunter Biden’s involvement surfacing as an issue was in December 2015, when the vice president traveled to Ukraine to deliver an anti-corruption speech and the New York Times wrote about his son’s role.Hunter Biden’s board appointment had been publicly announced the previous year and reported by the media at the time.The aide said that Hunter Biden’s position had no substantive impact.In the aggregate it didn’t have any discernible effect.”

The aide said that Joe Biden was dealing with a lot during Beau Biden’s bout with cancer, but that it had a minimal impact on his work.But I never saw evidence he wasn’t capable of doing the VP role and dealing with his family at the same time.”

Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement that “on Joe Biden’s watch, the U.S. made eradicating corruption a centerpiece of our policies toward Ukraine.”

AD

Hunter Biden joined the board of the Ukrainian gas company — headed by a former government minister investigated for possible corruption — in 2014, at the same time his father was leading U.S. efforts to crack down on corruption in that country.The issue has erupted in recent weeks amid revelations about a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukraine’s president to “look into” the Bidens, particularly whether Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor whose office had been investigating Burisma.The Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is seeking to determine whether Trump withheld military aid and diplomatic support to Ukraine in an attempt to get information to use against Biden.AD

Trump and his allies have made the unsubstantiated claim that Biden pressed for the prosecutor’s firing to protect his son.And Biden, adding to the calls from others in the U.S. government and Western institutions, was urging Ukraine to tap a new prosecutor who would be more aggressive in combating corruption.AD

Biden has said that he never spoke with his son about his dealings with Ukraine and has said that he only learned of his position on the Burisma board when he read about it in news reports.Hunter Biden told ABC News in an interview this week that he did “nothing wrong at all” but that he showed “poor judgment” in accepting the position on the Burisma board.AD

Joe Biden told reporters Wednesday that he wouldn’t have changed anything about his actions, including discouraging his son from joining the board, and said he had no regrets.That’s a fact.”

Biden has pledged that, if president, no one in his family would have “any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country.” During the presidential candidates debate Tuesday night, he twice dodged a question about why he did not have a similar policy as vice president.AD

But on Wednesday, he said his new policy was developed not because of anything Hunter Biden did but because of the actions of the Trump family.“In my White House, none of my children or family have offices at the White House,” Biden said.He has so debased the standard of what constitutes ethical behavior that the next president has to make it absolutely clear — absolutely clear — this will not happen again.”

AD

Biden’s campaign has been attempting to move past any discussions about Hunter Biden, and his team considers most questions having already been addressed.Biden aides also pointed toward the debate Tuesday night, where no candidate criticized Biden on the issue, as a sign that it is not resonating on the campaign trail.TUESDAY: Hunter Biden speaks

Hunter Biden told ABC News in the only interview he’s given since this story broke that he showed “poor judgment” and wouldn’t serve on any foreign boards if his dad, former vice president Joe Biden, were president, trying to clear the air about his work in Ukraine hours before the Democratic presidential debate.AD

George Kent, a former state Department official overseeing Ukraine, testified he was worried Hunter Biden’s work could undermine U.S. efforts, led by Biden, to encourage the Ukrainian government to address its own conflict of interest problems.This was in 2015, and Kent said he brought it up to the attention of then Vice President Biden’s office but was turned away by a staffer who said Biden was already overwhelmed by dealing with the terminal illness of his other son, Beau.There is still no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine, but Kent says he was worried about the appearance of it at the time.AD

Kent also testified that Giuliani tried to get the special prosecutor Biden wanted fired a visa to come to the United States, more evidence of how he was carrying out a shadow Ukraine foreign policy, ostensibly for Trump’s political benefit.That’s despite the fact Sondland comes across in text messages as one of Trump’s top defenders throughout the summer, as he, Giuliani and diplomats negotiated with Ukraine’s newly elected president to score an investigation into the Bidens.AD

House investigators have subpoenaed Perry for documents related to Trump’s call with Zelensky, which has triggered an impeachment inquiry into whether the president abused his power when he asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a political opponent, and his son Hunter.AD

AD

Since news reports about Trump’s effort to get Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden began to emerge, Trump and his allies have offered a broad array of rationales for the actions that have surfaced.The complaint articulates three components of the call: a request to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a request to investigate a server, and that Trump suggested Zelensky work with Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr.Scattered reports before the release of the rough transcript suggested Trump had engaged in a quid pro quo in his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.AD

Joe Biden should have been investigated!Biden’s call for the firing of Ukraine’s general prosecutor was presented by Trump as linked to Biden’s son’s work for an iffy Ukrainian energy company that, Trump allies allege, was under investigation.Trump defenders nonetheless argue that it’s appropriate for Trump to pressure Ukraine to investigate corruption and that a Biden probe would fit under that umbrella.There was no explicit quid pro quo in the call and no admitted quid pro quo involving Biden.At the core of the impeachment inquiry is Trump’s request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — while the United States was withholding nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine — for “a favor” in the form of investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as detailed in a rough transcript of a July 25 call between the two leaders that was released by the White House under public pressure.He urged, for instance, a corruption investigation into Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was vice president.So far, there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or his son.In rough notes released by the White House of Trump’s controversial call with Zelensky, the president seems to view Giuliani as almost interchangeable with Attorney General William P. Barr, telling Zelensky he hoped the Ukrainians could work with Giuliani and Barr to root out corruption there, including investigating the Bidens.AD

AD

While there are certainly still a number of unanswered questions surrounding Trump’s efforts to get Ukraine to help undermine both former vice president Joe Biden and the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, one aspect of that effort has become increasingly clear.When news broke that he planned to travel to Ukraine to try to dig up dirt focused on the Bidens and the 2016 election interference, he told the New York Times on May 9 that the information he received to that end “will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.” The benefit to Trump was the primary focus.Sondland claimed not to have been aware of Giuliani’s efforts on Biden — though, of course, the meeting came weeks after Giuliani had already spoken publicly about the issue.House investigators expect Laura Cooper to provide details about the nearly $400 million in military aid that was withheld from Ukraine as Trump pressed the country’s president to investigate Biden and his son.AD

The Washington Post first reported that Kent testified Tuesday that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.In his opening statement, which was obtained Friday by The Washington Post, Kent testified that he and other U.S. officials who “have spoken publicly in Ukraine to push back against Russian aggression and corrupt influences have been subjected to defamatory disinformation campaigns.”

Though it’s not part of the formal impeachment inquiry, Trump’s decision to hold a meeting of global leaders at one of his private resorts is casting another shadow over the administration, and rankling global leaders and Republicans.Appearing on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends,” Perry said he is still awaiting advice from his department’s general counsel about whether to comply with the subpoena, which seeks information related to Perry’s involvement in the July call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.Perry said that there was “no quid pro quo” involving military aid and investigating the Bidens and that Trump never mentioned the Bidens to him.“I’m going to follow the lead of my counsel on that.”

7:45 a.m.: Diplomat tells investigators he raised alarms in 2015 about Hunter Biden’s Ukraine work but was rebuffed

A career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about Biden’s son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer, according to three people familiar with the testimony.George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden’s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition.Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for obtaining influence with his father, the people said.But when Kent raised the issue with Biden’s office, he was told the then-vice president did not have the “bandwidth” to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau Biden, was battling cancer, they said.House investigators expect Cooper to provide details about the nearly $400 million in military aid that was withheld from Ukraine as Trump pressed the country’s president to investigate the Bidens and a debunked conspiracy theory that a hacked Democratic National Committee computer server was taken to Ukraine in 2016 to hide evidence that it was that country, not Russia, that interfered in the presidential election.Schiff embellished the transcript of the July phone call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.Then two weeks ago, Trump both defended his request that Ukraine investigate his potential 2020 campaign rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter and called on China to investigate the family, too.The comments, which Mulvaney later backpedaled, marked a stunning admission as House Democrats' impeachment investigation hoes in on whether Trump conditioned Ukrainian aid on the nation investigating the bizarre consiparcy theory and also the family of his 2020 rival former vice president Joe Biden.Democrats have taken particular issue with Facebook’s decision to allow an ad from [Trump’s] 2020 campaign that included falsehoods about former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.”

The public humiliation of Poroshenko illustrated the unusually aggressive approach employed by Biden, the Obama administration’s chief Ukraine envoy, to bring the distant but strategically important former Soviet republic closer to the West.It was an approach that yielded successes but also earned Biden and his aides a slew of enemies and detractors in Ukraine, and it may now have boomeranged to hurt his 2020 presidential campaign.AD

Biden’s actions unfolded over an extraordinary period of turmoil in Ukraine, as well as trauma in his own life.During the last three years of the Obama administration, Biden made five trips to Ukraine.Biden and Poroshenko’s conversations continued even after Biden left office, through earlier this year.AD

AD

Poroshenko would typically call Biden to wish him happy birthday.When Biden’s son Beau died in 2015, Poroshenko was one of the first to call with condolences.And when Poroshenko came to Washington, Biden sent flowers to his wife.Biden’s extensive involvement in the country’s fitful march toward reform has highlighted the political risks of becoming so deeply enmeshed in another country’s murky domestic affairs.The danger increased when Biden’s son Hunter took a paid position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company owned by a former government minister later accused of corruption.Though both Bidens say they did not discuss the gas company, the arrangement raised the perception that Biden’s family was benefiting from his vice-presidential role and gave ammunition to his critics, some of whom have now linked up with allies of Trump to smear the former vice president.The relationship between the two leaders fractured over time in part because of Biden’s repeated demands on Poroshenko, to the point that Biden’s allies now view some of the unsubstantiated allegations of corruption leveled against Biden as fallout from his actions on behalf of the U.S. government.Those allegations have been stoked in part by two Poroshenko allies — former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, whose firing Biden demanded, and his successor, Yuri Lutsenko.The actions of those Ukrainian prosecutors in Poroshenko’s orbit have led to President Trump’s insistence on an investigation into the Bidens that lies at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.AD

AD

“The vice president’s pressure on Poroshenko dialed up: Stop with excuses, get things done,” said Jake Sullivan, who for a year and a half was Biden’s national security adviser.And his relationship with the VP suffered as a result of that.”

This story is based on interviews with nearly a dozen aides and officials in the United States and Ukraine, including representatives to both Biden and Poroshenko.Biden had been tasked with overseeing efforts in a country that was teetering between Russian influence and a desire to be integrated with the European Union.It was a role made to order for Biden, raised politically during the Cold War and its aftermath.AD

AD

If he was sometimes wary of U.S. intervention, in this case Biden defined a broader rationale on behalf of the United States: dismantling the influence of Russia.As he grew further enmeshed during the spring of 2014, Biden took two trips there, first in April and then in June, for Poroshenko’s inauguration, where he walked the red carpet and grew optimistic that the allure of democracy could overcome autocracy.Biden and Poroshenko met for three hours, far past the allotted time, the two men sitting across from each other at a table filled with five aides on each side.AD

AD

“There was guarded optimism with Poroshenko, that he was perhaps someone who could run a more effective, cleaner government than his predecessors had,” said Sullivan, who accompanied Biden on those two trips.“He and the VP had a friendly, familiar rapport.”

Between Biden’s two springtime meetings, his son was appointed to a board seat at Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian gas company whose owner was the subject of a money-laundering probe and would later be investigated on charges of corruption.The position, for which Hunter Biden made between $50,000 and $100,000 a month, was part of the company’s effort to burnish its credentials and send a message that it had access to powerful people in the West.There were multiple red flags at the time that his son’s involvement appeared to be a conflict of interest, but Biden took no action to discourage it.Biden and Poroshenko began to clash as Biden continued pushing the Ukrainian president to do things he did not want to do, such as implement politically difficult reforms and push out some of his former allies.AD

AD

“Poroshenko undoubtedly was annoyed by always having to do these politically difficult things, and being asked by the U.S. to do it,” said Colin Kahl, who became Biden’s national security adviser in August 2014.Biden wasn’t naive.He knew as soon as you slacked off things would backslide.”

It was also a time of personal turmoil for Biden.His son Beau had been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2013, a crisis that those close to Biden said made him reluctant to criticize the decisions of Hunter Biden.By May 2015, when Beau Biden died, Hunter would be his only living son.AD

AD

Biden would persistently and forcefully raise questions on his calls with Poroshenko about the depth of his commitment to root out corruption, said Mike Carpenter, a former foreign policy adviser to Biden who was also deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia.It became obvious to us in Washington that the resistance was within Poroshenko’s inner circle.”

Both sides were frustrated, he said, but Biden “wasn’t moving on .AD

AD

“He became a single point of failure,” Kahl, Biden’s national security adviser, said of Shokin.“We could keep pushing corruption cases, but unless there was a fundamental change at the top, things weren’t going to change.”

Among the matters that had lain largely dormant under Shokin, according to U.S. officials and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, was the earlier investigation into the former minister who owned Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden served.When Biden went to Ukraine in December 2015, he used a new piece of leverage to try to force Poroshenko to act.“Look, you’re not getting this money unless Shokin is fired,” Biden told Poroshenko, according to Kahl.As Biden approached his speech to Ukraine’s parliament, his advisers crafted two versions.With Poroshenko still resistant, Biden and his aides gathered in a room and opened a laptop, reworking his speech just before he was scheduled to give it.They increased the degree to which Biden called for corruption crackdowns, attempting to ratchet up the pressure on Poroshenko to remove Shokin.Biden aides at the time figured Poroshenko was reluctant to get rid of Shokin because Shokin had something on him.But Poroshenko was also aggravated with Biden, who kept pressing him to do politically difficult things.It would take several more months — and a string of persistent calls from Biden — before Poroshenko removed Shokin.He met with Biden, and Biden congratulated him.Biden would later brag openly about the pressure he had applied and the threat he leveled over the loan guarantees, footage that one day would be used in an ad against him as supposed evidence of his own corruption.Biden’s public recounting of how he pressured Poroshenko to fire Shokin also came across in Kyiv as making the Ukrainian president look weak, like a marionette taking orders from Washington.But a few months later, three days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, Biden was in Ukraine for the last time.“I may have to call you once every couple weeks just to hear your voice,” Biden told Poroshenko during a news conference.“This has been going on a long time.”

In a private meeting, recounted by a Biden aide who was there, Poroshenko indicated he was baffled by Trump and eager to figure out how to get on his good side.He asked Biden for advice on how to approach the new leader.Biden told Poroshenko that U.S. foreign policy was much broader than Trump; he urged him to engage with incoming defense secretary Jim Mattis, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and others in the administration who had opposed Russian aggression.“I strongly urge the people of Ukraine: Keep demonstrating your commitment to the rule of law; keep fighting corruption; insist on transparency; investigate and prosecute government officials who siphon off public funds for their own enrichment,” Biden said during the news conference.Several times in 2017, Poroshenko called Biden, at times soliciting advice about how to deal with the new administration.He also repeatedly invited Biden to Ukraine to receive an award.“Biden was very cautious,” said Carpenter, who still works with Biden.They’re in office now.’ ”

Biden called Pence to brief him on the contents of his calls with Poroshenko, according to Carpenter.In his 2017 book, and in a speech he delivered in 2018 to the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden unflatteringly cast Poroshenko as an unwilling partner in moving Ukraine forward and, alternately, as someone he could bend to his demands.A spokeswoman for Poroshenko said in a statement that the Ukrainian leader had not considered his relationship with Biden ruined.In January, Giuliani conducted interviews with Shokin, the prosecutor Poroshenko fired at Biden’s urging, and Lutsenko, his successor.Both stirred up perceptions that Biden had pushed for Shokin’s firing to quash investigations into the owner of Burisma, where Hunter Biden was on the board — a baseless allegation that Giuliani is peddling for political gain in the 2020 election.(In his interactions with the Ukrainian prime minister’s office, Biden never mentioned anything that could be considered personal, such as cases against Burisma, said a former Ukrainian official familiar with the interactions.Biden allies and some in Ukraine suspect that Lutsenko would not have met with Giuliani without the blessing of Poroshenko — who was his boss at the time.A month after Giuliani spoke with Lutsenko and Shokin, Biden went to the Munich Security Conference and had a private one-on-one meeting with Poroshenko.Days later, Biden would announce his third bid for the presidency.AD

Reed often criticizes Joe Biden for allowing his son Hunter to be paid $50,000 a month for sitting on a Ukrainian board while he was vice president.They have been turning up an increasingly robust body of evidence showing that the president pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential contender, and his son Hunter.For one, his Doral announcement undercuts his own argument that Biden did something wrong when he allowed his son to make a profit from a Ukraine company board.They regularly claim the inquiry is invalid absent a full House vote (which is baseless); that Trump did nothing wrong in the Ukraine scandal (he pressured a foreign leader to help him rig our election by investigating potential opponent Joe Biden); that the whistleblower has been discredited (his complaint perfectly captured what Trump actually did); and that Biden did the same or worse (which is based on a fabricated narrative).Trump has adopted the unabashed posture that demanding the sham investigation of Biden is the affirmatively correct thing to do under the circumstances, and some GOP lawmakers are with him on this.AD

Fox is pushing similar messages — Trump is absolutely within his authority to call for an investigation of Biden, the truly corrupt figure in this situation; Trump is the real victim here (of the “deep state”).Although the accounts posed as Americans from all sides of the political spectrum, many were united in their opposition to the candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Graphika, a social media investigations company that Facebook asked to analyze the accounts.We’re seeing it already: The most corrupt president in history, who, among other things, gave his daughter and son-in-law key jobs in the White House, is charging that former vice president Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate for president, helped his son make money in Ukraine.Most gobsmacking of all, the Republican defense of his strong-arming the Ukrainian president into digging up dirt on the Bidens is that Trump — Trump!A few days prior, we had walked through all the points at which administration officials hinted at or explicitly identified an effort to trade either a White House meeting or that aid for investigations into former vice president Joe Biden or an element of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.An admission that seemed as if it might even be calibrated to undercut concerns central to the impeachment inquiry hanging over the White House: Arguing that the DNC server issue was the predicate for the aid being halted meant that the predicate wasn’t that investigation into Biden.Mulvaney explicitly denied a connection between aid and a desired Biden investigation when speaking on Thursday.When Wallace noted that Trump's call with Zelensky included a request for a favor and an ask that Ukraine investigate Biden, Mulvaney seized on the point.“You said, do me a favor and then immediately to the Bidens.You said that Trump responded to Zelensky's mention of aid by asking for the favor of looking at Biden when really Trump said he wanted the favor of investigating the DNC hacking.In text messages with other U.S. diplomats, Taylor raised alarms about the White House holding back military aid to Ukraine and pressing for investigations into the 2016 U.S. election and an energy company that employed former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.●Inside Joe Biden’s brawling efforts to reform Ukraine — which won him successes and enemies.Trump has repeatedly characterized the call — in which he urged Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens — as “perfect” and attacked Schiff for embellishing the transcript.It could be shifty Schiff.”

Trump reiterated his contention that his July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a “perfect call.” That call was the one in which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.Trump has repeatedly attacked Schiff for a statement in a hearing last month in which he embellished the transcript of the July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.Schiff embellished the transcript of the July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.The 72-year-old senator has condemned Trump for allegedly attempting to get officials in Ukraine to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and slammed the president’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.Diplomats involved in pressuring Ukraine to investigate the son of Trump’s 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, allegedly used private phones and texting apps to trade messages about their efforts, according to evidence released by leaders of the House impeachment inquiry.In July, Trump would have his now-famous phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which he pressed him to investigate unsubstantiated claims about Democratic rival Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory involving a computer server at the Democratic National Committee.At this point, of course, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani — and Trump himself — had already spent months openly advertising their corrupt scheme to pressure Ukraine to undertake fake investigations to undercut the fact of Russian interference in 2016 and smear potential 2020 rival Joe Biden.The two leaders didn’t urge Trump to see Zelensky as a potential source of smears against Biden.But they didn’t have to — feeding Trump this line helped reinforce a talking point Trump would use to pursue his own political goals while, they hoped, helping turn the United States against Ukraine: Trump could pressure Zelensky to help smear Biden, while pretending this was only about combating generic “corruption.”

AD

Indeed, as The Post reports, U.S. officials continue to say Trump’s pressure on Zelensky was mostly driven by Trump’s desire to target Biden and by conspiracy theories fed to him by Giuliani.Yet he flatly denied there was any quid pro quo for the smearing of Biden.AD

AD

How likely is it that Trump had the White House meeting on his mind when freezing the military aid, but did not have the smearing of Biden on his mind, after months of public and private obsessing over the Biden/Ukraine angle, at precisely the moment he maximized his leverage over Ukraine?The senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine said Tuesday he was told release of military aid was contingent on public declarations from Ukraine that it would investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election, contradicting President Trump’s denial that he used the money as leverage for political gain.Trump specifically took issue with media coverage of former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.After Hannity noted that Hunter Biden was hired for the board of a Ukrainian energy company despite his lack of experience, Trump said he has “a bad track record.” The president pointed to Hunter Biden being “thrown out” of the Navy Reserve, which happened in 2014 after a drug test came back positive for cocaine.And in what may be remembered as his most important non-deal, Trump apparently tried to make a deal with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — you find me dirt on Joe Biden, and I’ll release the military aid Congress appropriated — and the result is that not only did he not get what he wanted, he will likely be impeached because of it.William B. Taylor Jr. , a retired civil servant who headed the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv after the administration abruptly recalled Yovanovitch, said in a text that he considered it “crazy” to withhold U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless Kyiv agreed to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — Trump’s political rival — and his son Hunter Biden.How does he explain what Taylor outlines, which is that Trump was directly linking military assistance to demands that the Ukraine president announce publicly his intention to start investigations into the 2016 campaign and former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden?Trump has called the July 25 phone call “perfect.” In that conversation, he asked for “a favor” from Zelensky and specifically mentioned 2016 and the Bidens.“But President Trump did insist that President [Zelensky] go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference,” according to the prepared testimony.“By mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelenskyy wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma,” which employed Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden, “and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,” Taylor said.“I understood a ‘stalemate’ to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance.”

Sondland also said testified last week that “I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former vice president Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.”

AD

But Taylor described Sondland relaying a direct request involving the Bidens to Ukraine.As Slavitt notes, there are a variety of Democratic plans to build on the ACA, which he argues, “Trump and Republicans resist at their peril.”

Now the question remains whether evidence of the reduced cost of ACA premiums will weigh in favor of candidates such as Klobuchar, former vice president Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who all favor a public option.The profile includes images of no humans but rather stock photos of stars and a landscape paired with the text, “It is time to take back our countries.” The account retweets virulent attacks on Democrats in the United States, including former vice president Joe Biden, and appears to draw inspiration from conservative U.S. media figures, such as radio host Mark Levin.Ross also told Fox Business Network that the ‘actual meat’ of the agreement would come in two additional phases yet to be completed.”

— Pence and Biden argue trade in PA: "Vice President Mike Pence and former Vice President Joe Biden went head to head on trade ... both using Pennsylvania, a critical electoral state, to prove their opposing points on the efficacy of the Trump administration's new North American trade proposal," Politico's Sabrina Rodríguez and Matthew Choi report."Biden sent a scathing statement to a local news outlet, The Citizens’ Voice, lambasting [Trump’s] record on the working class, shortly before Pence’s planned visit to Luzerne County, Pa., to tout the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement."Biden's statement: "[Trump] has talked tough on trade but has nothing to show for it, other than pain for America’s families,” Biden wrote to the paper.“[Pence] has been his complicit sidekick, propping up Trump’s trade wars and slighting hard-working Americans in Luzerne County and across the country.”

"[Trump] has talked tough on trade but has nothing to show for it, other than pain for America’s families,” Biden wrote to the paper.The Post's Tony Romm and Isaac Stanley-Becker: "Facebook on Monday said it removed a network of Russian-backed accounts that posed as locals weighing in on political issues in swing states, praising President Trump and attacking former vice president Joe Biden — illustrating that the familiar threat of Russian interference looms over the next U.S. presidential race.The senator blasted Trump's attempts to dig up dirt on Joe Biden "wrong and appalling" and lamented the U.S. withdrawal from Syria.Open to impeachment: On “Axios on HBO,” Romney said that Trump's calls to have China and Ukraine investigate Joe and Hunter Biden were “shocking” and that he remains open to removing Trump from office should the House pass articles of impeachment: “It was shocking, in my opinion, for the president to do so — and a mistake for him to do.I can't imagine coming to a different point of view.”

On “Axios on HBO,” Romney said that Trump's calls to have China and Ukraine investigate Joe and Hunter Biden were “shocking” and that he remains open to removing Trump from office should the House pass articles of impeachment: “It was shocking, in my opinion, for the president to do so — and a mistake for him to do.The details: “Neither of those foreign leaders specifically encouraged Trump to see Ukraine as a potential source of damaging information about [Biden], nor did they describe Kyiv as complicit in an unsubstantiated 2016 election conspiracy theory, officials said,” our colleagues write.“But their disparaging depictions of Ukraine reinforced Trump’s perceptions of the country and fed a dysfunctional dynamic in which White House officials struggled to persuade Trump to support the fledgling government in Kyiv instead of exploiting it for political purposes, officials said.”

“Neither of those foreign leaders specifically encouraged Trump to see Ukraine as a potential source of damaging information about [Biden], nor did they describe Kyiv as complicit in an unsubstantiated 2016 election conspiracy theory, officials said,” our colleagues write.So, too, in the Ukraine scandal, the goalposts have moved from the “perfect” July 25 call to no evidence of a campaign violation to no quid pro quo to Sen. Lindsey O. Graham’s (R-S.C.) “no quid pro quo outside the July 25 call.” Under any reasonable definition of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” asking Ukraine to come up with dirt on former vice president Joe Biden to influence our election is an impeachable offense, but now Trump enablers are insisting on an ever-higher bar and exclusion of evidence we already have (the July 25 transcript) in order to rule out impeachment.(“Trump reiterated his contention that his July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a ‘perfect call.’ That call was the one in which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.” Not so perfect, then.)Bolton and others saw Sondland’s line as a clear reference to Trump’s desire to have Ukrainian authorities dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had secured a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at a time when his father was overseeing Obama administration policy.Trump used his July 25 call with Zelensky to secure that very commitment, reminding the leader of Ukraine how much aid his country received from the United States before soliciting dirt on Biden and material that might help substantiate 2016 conspiracy claims with the line: “I would like you to do us a favor though.”

Pelosi distributed a “fact sheet” Monday describing Trump’s push for a Ukrainian investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter as a gross abuse of presidential power.Officials said Putin and Orban did not encourage Trump to seek such information on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.AD

Trump was obsessed with the idea that Ukraine could produce information damaging Joe Biden.Whether Trump actually believed the debunked theory that Biden pressured Ukraine to oust a prosecutor widely seen as corrupt to help his son Hunter is barely relevant.Here’s what’s not in question: Trump was focused on Biden and Ukraine.But there is no question that Trump focused much of his attention to Ukraine on the Bidens.At Trump’s direction, Rudy Giuliani ran his own foreign policy whose goal was to get Ukraine to produce dirt on Biden.In a text to Sondland, Taylor incredulously asked whether military aid and a White House meeting Zelensky sought “are conditioned on investigations.” Taylor has now testified that the meeting was “conditioned" on investigations into Burisma — the company Hunter Biden worked for — and “alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.” Taylor added: "It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani.”

Taylor then testified that on a call, Sondland stated that Trump told him he wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to “publicly” pledge investigations — which would undercut the fact of Russian sabotage of the 2016 election and help smear potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.Barr keeps popping up in this scheme

On his July 25 call, Trump pressured Zelensky to help validate the 2016 Ukraine conspiracy theory and to help smear Biden — and instructed Zelensky to work with Barr to get it done.Second, Trump asked for an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, a potential Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, and his son Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine.AD

AD

No evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden has surfaced.But Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, this year pushed to get Ukraine to investigate both the Biden and CrowdStrike claims.An ongoing impeachment inquiry in the House is focused on whether Trump abused his office by making these requests of Zelensky, and whether Trump conditioned the security assistance funds, or a meeting Zelensky was seeking with the U.S. president, on the CrowdStrike or Biden probes.He doesn’t bring up Ukraine’s well-documented corruption in his public remarks; he focuses on Biden and the CrowdStrike-DNC server tale.Mulvaney’s bare-bones description on Fox News cited “information from our folks” and Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, in which corruption was not discussed but the Bidens and CrowdStrike were.As far as we can tell, Trump’s concern is limited to Joe Biden and the DNC server.AD

A key example: Sondland said, “I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former vice president Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens."AD

Perhaps Sondland’s defense will be that he pushed for the Burisma investigation and not one specifically into the Bidens.That would be quite the rhetorical trick, but it would fit neatly into his testimony, in which he claimed he “did not understand, until much later, that Mr. [Rudolph W.] Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son ...” He said that, as of August, “I did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma.”

I wrote about how difficult that was to swallow, given that Hunter Biden’s work for Burisma and Giuliani’s efforts to pursue that investigation in Ukraine had been in the news for months.Perhaps he knew what Taylor would say, and his new defense — however implausible — would be that he didn’t expressly or implicitly call for investigating the Bidens, because he didn’t know that was the same as Burisma.They didn’t know Burisma was about the Bidens

A related defense to the one above is this: Maybe there was an explicit quid pro quo on an investigation involving the Bidens, but those involved didn’t know it involved the Bidens.They just knew it involved the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, whose board Hunter Biden happened to serve on.“I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former vice president Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens,” Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified last week.He added that as of August, “I did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma.”

Outgoing energy secretary Rick Perry added Wednesday morning on Hewitt’s radio show: “In our conversations dealing with this issue, I never heard the president say the words ‘Biden.’ I never heard the word ‘Biden’ mentioned, not from him, not from staff, not from the E.U.ambassador, not from [former special envoy to Ukraine] Kurt Volker.”

Here’s the thing, though: Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani did not hide that this was about the Bidens.Trump himself invoked the Bidens publicly on May 19.Giuliani was already publicly agitating for the investigations Trump sought, including one targeting former vice president Joe Biden.Once Zelensky agreed to also investigate Biden, Trump offered to host Zelensky in Washington.AD

AD

On Aug. 16, Yermak also suggested to Volker that the United States formally request an investigation that might target Biden, according to Taylor.“The Top US diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor testified Tuesday that he had been told President Donald Trump would withhold military aid to the country until it publicly declared investigations would be launched that could help his reelection chances — including into former Vice President Joe Biden, according to a copy of Taylor’s opening statement.”

For all those Republicans insisting there had to be a quid pro quo, we found it!He has specific access, he talks about a conversation which I just put up on my Twitter, a conversation that he had with Ambassador [Gordon] Sondland in which Sondland tells him directly, President Trump wants the aid conditioned from Ukraine on investigating the Bidens.The Firtash case has helped provide fodder for Giuliani’s theories through one known avenue: In September, Firtash’s Austrian lawyers filed in court an affidavit by a former Ukrainian prosecutor in which the prosecutor claimed he was fired because he was investigating then-Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.Meanwhile, Parnas and Fruman were also assisting Giuliani as he sought information in Ukraine to prove his claims that Democrats received help from Ukrainians during the 2016 election and that Biden had orchestrated the 2016 removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he was investigating the gas company Burisma, whose board included Biden’s son.In fact, the international community was broadly in favor of removing the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, and the Burisma investigation was dormant at the time that Biden urged his removal.But in January 2019, Parnas and Fruman helped connect Giuliani by Skype to Shokin, who alleged to the former New York mayor that his firing was connected to his Biden work.Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas — two Soviet emigres who hired Trump’s personal lawyer and then helped him investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — made a brief appearance in federal court in a case that also has led federal investigators to scrutinize Giuliani’s interactions with the pair.That’s what this is,” Rep Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) declared as he attacked Democrats for questioning Trump’s alleged efforts to compel Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the son of his 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden.They say the president wanted Zelensky to investigate the location of the DNC server, not the Biden family.William B. Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified Tuesday that Trump wanted military aid to Ukraine linked to the country’s willingness to investigate the 2016 election and former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.AD

The association said its concerns culminated when Barr did not recuse himself from review of a whistleblower complaint about a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed his counterpart in Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.A Justice Department spokeswoman has said previously that Trump had never spoken with Barr “about having Ukraine investigate anything related to former vice president Biden or his son.” Officials have said Barr only learned later, after the complaint made its way to the Justice Department, Trump had mentioned him on the call.Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas — two Soviet emigres who hired Trump’s personal attorney and then helped him investigate Joe Biden — made a brief appearance in federal court in a case that has also led federal investigators to scrutinize Giuliani’s interactions with the pair.Those claims have come as the president and his administration sought to explain away a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky, during which Trump pressured his counterpart to open investigations into Biden and his son Hunter, and into a debunked conspiracy theory involving a hacked Democratic National Committee computer server.), are arguing that Ukrainians were unaware that U.S. military aid was being withheld and therefore Trump could not have offered a “quid pro quo” by asking for an investigation of the Bidens.“Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation,” Taylor said, referring to the Ukrainian gas company that employed Hunter Biden.In America, even people who confess to crimes get a fair process.”

Trump unleashed a gusher of foul language, referring to himself as a “son of a bitch,” claiming that Biden was a good vice president only because “he understood how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass,” and saying “hell” 18 times — and that was all in a single campaign rally.At another rally the following night, Trump denigrated Biden’s son Hunter for his struggles with substance abuse and called him a “loser,” while also declaring that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) “hates the United States of America.”

And just this week, Trump declared that the House impeachment inquiry was a “lynching” — equating his political troubles with the systematic murders of African Americans by racist white mobs.AD

A number of Republicans, for example, defended Trump’s lynching comparison, pointing to past uses of the metaphor by Biden and other Democrats.Isn’t that better?”

One of his major targets of late is Hunter Biden, who has come under scrutiny for accepting a paid position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president.At a campaign rally in Dallas last week, Trump mocked Biden’s struggles with drug use and said he was “thrown out of the Navy like a dog” — a reference to Biden’s discharge from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine.Trump put his own interests (dirt on Biden) above American democracy and above our national security needs, which entail resisting Russian aggression in Europe.The full details of what the two leaders discussed in that Easter Sunday phone call have never been publicly disclosed, and it is not clear whether Trump explicitly asked for an investigation of the Bidens.Hochstein is a former diplomat who advised Biden on Ukraine matters during the Obama administration.Trump also pushed Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son.Trump has denied that an investigation of Biden was a condition for releasing military aid as a quid pro quo.AD

Before Zelenskiy was elected, however, a public campaign to initiate investigations into the Bidens was already underway.For weeks, conservative media outlets in the U.S. had trumpeted unfounded accusations that Biden, the Obama administration’s top envoy to the war-torn former Soviet republic, had sought the removal of the country’s top prosecutor in order to stymie an investigation in Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that later hired his son to serve on its board.AD

Taylor said he understood that on Sept. 1, Sondland warned Zelensky aide Andrey Yermak that the security assistance “would not come” unless Zelensky committed to pursuing the investigation into Burisma, which could have damaged Joe Biden, a top 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful.Taylor testified that it was clear earlier in the summer that Giuliani’s focus on Burisma was related to Biden.Sondland told House investigators last week that he recalls “no discussions” with anyone at the State Department or White House about investigating Biden.Taylor also testified that Tim Morrison, a National Security Council official, had recounted to him a conversation between Trump and Sondland on Sept. 7 in which Trump insisted that Zelensky “go to a microphone” and commit to “opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference.”

Both Trump and Giuliani made public comments and tweets referencing the Biden accusations, with the president’s lawyer suggesting in a Fox News interview on April 7 that the U.S. Justice Department should investigate the matter.While Taylor viewed U.S. military assistance to Ukraine as vital for pushing back Russia in the east, the parallel universe line of diplomacy apparently viewed it as a bargaining chip for Ukraine to investigate the family of Joe Biden, the president’s political rival.The Associated Press reports that in early May, before he had even taken office, Zelensky had gathered a small group of advisers to discuss how to navigate the requests from Trump and Giuliani for a probe into Biden’s son Hunter and “how to avoid becoming entangled in the American elections.”

When these two parallel worlds of diplomacy collide, there is collateral damage.In her order, Howell called the Justice Department’s position “most troubling” when combined with its policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted and the Trump administration’s “open stonewalling [of] the House’s efforts to get information by subpoena and by agreement.”

The House, Howell said, is “the only federal body that can act on allegations of presidential misconduct,” yet under the Justice Department’s reasoning, “the Executive Branch would be empowered to wall off any evidence of presidential misconduct from the House by placing that evidence before a grand jury.”

The House lawsuit preceded the September disclosure of President Trump’s request to Ukrainian government officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 campaign rival, and Biden’s son Hunter.There have been questions recently about whether Trump will keep Giuliani as his lawyer given Giuliani’s prominent role in seeking help from Ukraine in investigating the Bidens, which is at the center of the House’s impeachment inquiry.Taylor said he spoke to Morrison several times about his concerns that Trump was using the aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.In the interview with the former top U.S. diplomat to air on both CNN International and PBS on Friday night, Kerry calls the evidence against Trump “more powerful already than what we saw in the impeachment of Richard Nixon.”

9:15 a.m.: Biden, Trump aides spar over roles of the men’s children

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway took a shot Friday at former vice president Joe Biden, as his and Trump’s adult children continued to be a flash point in the presidential campaign.Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company has been central to the impeachment drama.Trump pressed Ukraine to investigate the company, and Republicans more broadly have argued that Hunter Biden would not have had a position that paid $50,000 a month if his father hadn’t been the sitting vice president at the time.In an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” a portion of which aired Thursday, Joe Biden sought to turn the tables on Trump.My children are not going to sit in on Cabinet meetings,” Biden said.Conway responded to Biden during an appearance on Fox News on Friday.In fact, the account of the whistleblower closely tracked a rough transcript of the July call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when U.S. military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.AD

CNN reports that Tim Morrison, a top National Security Council adviser, will likely confirm key aspects of Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr.’s explosive testimony that Trump withheld military aid to leverage Ukraine into launching sham investigations undercutting 2016 Russian interference and smearing potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.AD

AD

In addition, William B. Taylor Jr. said in his testimony, according to news reports, that Bolton was (understandably) concerned about the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump seemed to tie both a White House visit and aid to Zelensky’s cooperation in finding dirt on former vice president Joe Biden.The Facts

The investigation into President Trump’s handling of relations with Ukraine — and whether he froze aid to pressure the country’s president to announce a probe into a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden — started with a whistleblower complaint forwarded by the inspector general of the intelligence community.Collins has offered similar comments about being a juror, but she was even more critical of Trump’s request for China to investigate the Bidens.AD

AD

“The president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period.“I think that would be important.”

AD

AD

Democrats have played down the necessity of the whistleblower’s testimony for weeks, starting with the Sept. 25 release of the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asks Zelensky to do him “a favor” by investigating an alleged Ukrainian role in the 2016 election, as well as the role that the son of former vice president Joe Biden played at a Ukrainian gas company.Morrison is the person who told Taylor that the Trump administration had directly informed Ukraine “that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelenskyy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation,” according to Taylor’s opening statement to investigators, referring to the energy company Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, worked for and using an alternate transliteration of the Ukrainian president’s name.He testifies he heard from another official that the president wanted a public Ukrainian declaration to investigate Democrats and the Biden family.He even accused former vice president Joe Biden of raping and pillaging the nation, though instead of saying “rape,” Trump said “the R-word.”

Without the luxury of undivided attention, anyone who tried to follow the bouncing ball of Trump’s hourly utterances and tweets was doomed to fail, and there is no relief on the horizon.Legislation would mark a significant escalation in Democrats' criticism of Facebook’s policy, which has been building since the company's decision to allow President Trump to run an ad with false claims about former vice president Joe Biden.Just a few weeks earlier, Schapiro wrote, Giuliani had left him a voice mail in which he could be heard making corruption claims about former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.A day earlier, Schapiro had spoken to Giuliani for a story that quoted several of the attorney’s former Justice Department colleagues saying they thought he had broken the law in pressing for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.In the message, Giuliani repeated familiar, unfounded allegations against the Bidens, Schapiro wrote.He claimed that Joe Biden had been “trading in on his public office” and that his son had done the same.He said the former vice president had halted the investigation of a Ukrainian gas company because Hunter Biden was on its board.Giuliani also said he was being attacked because of his public accusations against the Biden family.Trump has attacked the whistleblower at least 40 times on his Twitter account since the Ukraine scandal broke, including on Friday, when he asked, “Where is the whistleblower and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian president?”

The GOP line of questioning provides the most direct insight to date into the strategy of the president’s defenders in closed-door hearings that have produced powerful testimony about the administration’s attempt to coerce Ukraine into conducting investigations that Trump hoped would yield damaging information on Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden.Biden is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.AD

The complaint filed by the CIA employee on Aug. 12 described deep concerns among senior administration officials about a July 25 call on which President Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations that could be damaging to Biden.At the time, Yovanovitch was seeking to contain efforts by Giuliani to bypass normal diplomatic channels in his efforts to persuade government officials in Ukraine to revive corruption investigations into an energy company that had employed Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, as a board member.Taylor’s testimony described a concerted campaign by Trump to pressure Ukraine — including the withholding of a promised White House meeting with Zelensky and the suspension nearly $400 million of security assistance — to coerce Ukraine into delivering information that could hurt Biden and validate Trump’s conspiracy theories about 2016 election interference.Republicans have also used their time to go after Biden, including citing Trump’s unsubstantiated allegation that Biden used his position as vice president to pressure Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had been investigating the energy company that had employed Biden’s son.The survey period ended just before House Democrats opened the impeachment inquiry into Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to find damaging information about the 2016 election and about former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.They have urged him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden.The price Graham, and the other nine senators, had to pay is listening to Trump repeat himself, about the Russia investigation and now the impeachment inquiry about his effort to push Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden’s dealings there.Parnas has said that in January he helped connect Giuliani to a former Ukrainian prosecutor who claimed he had been fired at the urging of then-Vice President Joe Biden because he was investigating a Ukrainian company whose board included Biden’s son.He also hardened his tone on the impeachment hearings, vowing not to testify before a congressional inquiry he said was “not only illegal, but improper.”

Perry told The Associated Press that he urged Trump to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to offer Ukraine “an alternative to Russian gas” and said he never once heard the word Biden or Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that once employed Biden’s son.AD

The impeachment inquiry is investigating whether Trump was withholding military aid unless Zelenskiy went public with a promise to investigate the Bidens.The elder Biden is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.Trump told a group of Republican lawmakers that it was Perry who had prompted the July phone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy for a “favor” regarding Biden, according to an AP source familiar with the president’s remarks.Referring to the rough transcript in which Trump urged Zelensky to investigate former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Romney said on Twitter that “if the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme.”

When Trump publicly said Ukraine and China should investigate the Bidens, Romney said such a “brazen” request was “wrong and appalling” and “politically motivated.”

Trump punched back.Just after 11:30 p.m., Obama delivered his televised remarks from the Cross Hall entrance to the East Room, as a small group of reporters and aides, including Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, looked on.NORAH O’DONNELL: President Trump has said publicly, “Joe Biden and his son are stone cold corrupt.” And chances are, he’s watching this interview.Asked about Trump’s children — a daughter and son-in-law working in the White House with a mound of conflicts and two sons running international business operations as Trump directs business to his properties — Biden was matter-of-fact:

On a day Trump was offering nauseating self-congratulations and touting a raid to kill Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a raid made more dangerous and difficult by his own incoherent foreign policy directives, Biden sounded confident without a hint of the narcissism we’ve witnessed from Trump:

I’m not worried about my legacy.Biden openly ridiculed Trump’s claim that Russian intervention was a hoax.Everybody knows this,” Biden responded.Release your tax returns or shut up.”

AD

Biden also seemed more comfortable and less defensive about his center-left philosophy.They’re things I’ve done.”

AD

Whatever Biden did to prepare for this interview, he should do in advance of the next debate.His relaxed demeanor, concise barbs and low-key confidence in the power of center-left politics that have defined his career reminded one of the Joe Biden of the 2012 vice presidential debate.Biden might even consider doing more of these interviews so long as he can effectively taunt Trump and gently remind viewers that anyone can make pie-in-the-sky promises, but few can assume the presidency with no learning curve.The official, Fiona Hill, learned then about the involvement of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Giuliani associates who were helping with the Naftogaz pressure and also with trying to find dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky faced pressure to announce investigations into the family of former vice president Joe Biden and into the debunked conspiracy theory that a hacked DNC server was taken to Ukraine in 2016 to hide evidence that it was that country, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election.AD

Trump has accused Biden — a potential 2020 rival — of trying to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to stop an investigation of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company for which his son, Hunter Biden, had served on the board.Poroshenko has also rebutted Trump’s claim about Biden, saying this month that the former vice president never asked him to open or close cases.Telizhenko said he discussed two unsubstantiated claims with Giuliani that have since become central to Trump’s attitudes toward Ukraine — that the Ukrainian embassy in Washington where Telizhenko once worked aided Clinton’s campaign, and that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to stop an investigation of the energy company.Embassy staffers, the former contractor and the Biden family have vehemently denied these claims.The previous day, he had said there was nothing wrong with Trump urging China to investigate his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden.“In South Carolina, Democrats are working to chip away at a [former vice president Joe] Biden’s early advantage.Bolstered by the eight years he served as vice president to Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, Biden has deep connections with black politicians and clergy.”

Someone should find out this week what Russia did to help.AD

Hence, we get the never-ending shock of political reporters that former vice president Joe Biden is a front-runner or co-front-runner in many polls.Hougland says the technology is needed given the challenges facing candidates such as former vice president Joe Biden, from rivals and from other countries.Facebook just announced last week that it took down a network of Russian accounts whose top target was Biden.And the Trump campaign has flooded Facebook with ads containing baseless claims about Biden's dealings in Ukraine.“I think the Trump [campaign's] Biden ads [show that].Kupperman listened in to the July 25 call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Taylor said he spoke to Morrison several times about his concerns that Trump was using military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.He’s a good man.”

Giuliani has become a key figure in the Ukraine scandal because of his repeated efforts to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.Barr has been traveling the globe to solicit dirt on Biden.Democratic presidential candidates have blasted the company for allowing President Trump to make false claims about former vice president Joe Biden in ads, and Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) recently told the Technology 202 he's working on legislation to ensure that Facebook isn't making money off of politicians disseminating falsehoods.“I asked the president to make the call.” Perry said he did not hear the Bidens mentioned: "[H]e urged Trump to call [Zelensky] to offer Ukraine 'an alternative to Russian gas' and said he never once heard the word Biden or Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that once employed Biden’s son,” per the AP.Despite his remove from the White House, Vindman became deeply concerned about the way the president and some of his top advisers were manipulating Ukraine policy to discredit Biden, a possible challenger in the 2020 election.“This alternative narrative undermined U.S. efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine.”

AD

Vindman cites a July 10 meeting in which Gordon Sondland, a major Trump donor and ambassador to the European Union, emphasized that to secure a meeting with Trump, the Ukrainians would have to “deliver investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,” a Ukrainian natural gas company that had controversially tapped Biden’s son to serve on its board.Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the National Security Council was going to get involved with or push,” his statements reads.Vindman’s statement notes that an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma would likely inject Ukraine’s new president into U.S. politics and cause the struggling democracy to lose bipartisan support in Congress.AD

Behind closed doors, according to people familiar with what transpired, Vindman also testified Tuesday that the contents of the July 25 call differed slightly from what is stated in the official transcript that the White House released late last month — including that Zelensky referenced Burisma, and not just a nameless company, when Trump pressed him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter.Hunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, for five years.According to people familiar with Vindman’s testimony, who discussed the closed session on the condition of anonymity, he also remembered Trump going on about how Joe Biden was on tape boasting about Ukraine funds — most likely referring to comments Biden made in January 2018 that the United States held $1 billion in loan guarantees until the nation fired its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin.During the previously scheduled debrief, “Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma,”Vindman’s prepared testimony reads.Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push,” Vindman adds.Last week, Taylor testified that he learned from Morrison that Ukraine’s military aid was being held up to secure investigations into the role Joe Biden’s son Hunter had on Burisma’s board, as well as a debunked conspiracy theory involving a Democratic National Committee server that was hacked in 2016.Yet during her first days without Chuck in more than four decades, Biden, whom she barely knew, spoke with her several times, often talking of his own losses.But every day until you leave this Earth, you will miss him.’ ”

Perhaps more than any political figure since Robert F. Kennedy, who ran for president less than five years after his brother’s murder, personal grief is at the center of Biden’s public identity.As Biden crisscrosses the country trying to convince people that he should be president, he often encourages voters to reflect on their most difficult, grief-stricken moments — and his.In an age when so much of politics is about memes and tweets, blogs and GIFs, some voters say it humanizes Biden in a way that is not pierced by public gaffes or the attacks of his rivals.AD

AD

Biden’s sorrow has emerged anew in recent weeks, amid questions about how he has handled the potential conflict of interest involving Hunter, his surviving son.Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company when Biden was spearheading Ukraine policy as vice president.A State Department official told lawmakers recently that in 2015, when he contacted the vice president’s office about the potential appearance of a conflict in Hunter’s role, he was told Biden did not have the “bandwidth” to deal with it while Beau was battling cancer.Biden is almost certain to continue facing such questions, and he has promised that if elected, no one associated with him will serve on foreign boards.For those who’ve forged a connection with Biden, such statements are not necessary.Biden and his campaign declined to comment for this article.AD

AD

But no other candidate weaves grief into his personal message the way Biden does.Biden’s associates acknowledge that he derives a political benefit from displaying his sadness so publicly and sharing his agony on the campaign trail.“As they say, in politics, you’re always on — there’s no question about that,” said Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), a friend of Biden’s.But you really have to be you.”

AD

When Biden appeared recently in Los Angeles at an event sponsored by the Service Employees International Union, neither attendees nor moderators raised the current impeachment furor, which arose from Trump’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.Instead, the moment that endured was Biden’s emotional reply to a woman who asked what he would do to improve the lives of home-health-care workers.Wiping away tears, Biden talked about the emotional roller coaster of caring for Beau.AD

“Eighteen months he lived, knowing he was going to die — nobody makes it,” Biden said, referring to the severity of Beau’s diagnosis.The president shouldn’t react that way,” Biden said.“Raise your hand,” Biden told those in the crowd, “if you’ve lost a son or daughter, husband or wife, or you yourself are fighting cancer.” He continued: “Just look around.“It amazes me how many people there are who endure and live with devastating loss with nowhere near the support I have had, who get up every single day, put one foot in front of the other, and simply carry on,” Biden writes.And many of them do.”

The campaign is showcasing Biden’s relationship with tragedy in a new way.After a swift rise that saw Biden elected to the U.S. Senate before he was 30, his wife and baby daughter were killed in 1972 when their station wagon was broadsided by a truck as they were shopping for a Christmas tree.Biden’s two sons were seriously injured.AD

AD

Beau, who Biden has referred to as Joe Biden 2.0, died when his father was vice president.Biden himself had surgery for two aneurysms in 1988.In 2012, when Biden was addressing family members of service personnel killed in action, he paused to recall the death of his wife and daughter.“For the first time in my life, I understood how someone could consciously decide to commit suicide,” Biden told them.The speech prompted conservative columnist Michael Gerson to write of Biden, “Sometimes he seems to be the last genuine human being in American politics.”

Sen. Christopher A. Coons, a Democrat who occupies the Delaware seat once held by Biden — and who was consoled by Biden after his own father died — said the former vice president’s empathy is real.AD

AD

“I have been with people where Joe Biden was not looking for their vote, could not ever be helped by them — complete strangers from other parts of the country at times when he was clearly not running again,” Coons said.She is well aware that Biden is a politician, but as an Iowa voter she’s confident she can spot someone trying to manipulate her.She says her talks with Biden were among her few bright moments during one of the darkest periods of her life.When Biden and his wife, Jill, sent flowers to Chuck’s funeral, she had them dried with silica and, a year later, spread the petals over Chuck’s grave.Biden’s calls were not derived from some set of talking points provided by an aide, she said.For a while they said Trump’s phone call — in which he instructed the president of Ukraine to manufacture smears of Joe Biden — was, in the president’s words, perfect.Yes, they’ll say, it was not a good thing for Trump to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden to help in his reelection campaign.AD

On that call, of course, Trump corruptly pressured Zelensky to validate conspiracy theories undermining the confirmed fact of Russian sabotage of the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf, and to help Trump rig the 2020 election by smearing Biden.Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma.Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.AD

All of this comports with Hill’s own testimony that Bolton was so irate about what he’d heard that he referred to it as a “drug deal” that Sondland and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney were “cooking up.”

What’s notable here is Vindman’s assertion that in that subsequent debriefing, they discussed the demand for an investigation into the Bidens in particular.As Ryan Goodman notes, this contradicts Sondland’s own testimony that he didn’t recall any discussion of the Bidens, so Sondland may be legally exposed now.That’s belied by the fact that Trump’s lawyer Rudolph Giuliani repeatedly and publicly called on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens going back to at least May — and that Trump named Biden on the July 25 call — but put that aside for now.AD

One big revelation from William Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, is that he testified that Sondland had privately noted internally that Trump was demanding that Zelensky publicly announce an investigation of the Bidens.So here we have Vindman, a sympathetic witness, offering further corroboration of just how well understood it was that the Bidens, not generic corruption, were the real target of the “investigations” Trump wanted.Former vice president Joe Biden, in a written statement released Monday, went right after Trump’s incoherent strategy.“It’s been reported that Trump’s reckless decision to withdraw our troops from northern Syria forced the planning for the mission to be accelerated and the timeline compressed,” Biden declared.And they had to fly through territory that is now hostile to the U.S., taking fire along the way — including territory we controlled just weeks ago.”

AD

AD

Biden added, “Trump has also made it less likely we will be able to successfully replicate a mission like this in the future.It relied on allies he has belittled, undermined, and in some cases betrayed and abandoned.”

As a number of experts have pointed out, Biden argued, “His fixation on keeping troops in the region to defend the oil fields betrays his true priorities — profit seeking — and will surely serve as a tool for future terrorist recruitment.”

He then distinguished himself both from Trump and the “bring everyone home” crowd on the left.“That’s the smart, strong, and sustainable strategy we pioneered during the Obama-Biden Administration.Biden cautions: “Trump wants to tear it all down and walk away.According to his prepared testimony, Vindman will say that European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland said after a July 10 meeting with a top Ukrainian official that a long-sought meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump depended upon Ukraine launching specific investigations — those involving former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a conspiracy theory about the origins of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election:

What it doesn’t say: Vindman in his prepared statement doesn’t quite indicate the Bidens and the 2016 election investigations were explicitly broached in the meeting with Danylyuk — perhaps because it was cut short.I don’t want to see those two things combined.”

And here’s the other:

Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told House committees that he believed Ukraine agreeing to open investigations into Burisma Group — a gas company where Democrat Joe Biden’s son once served on the board — and into alleged 2016 election interference was a condition for a White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Sondland’s lawyer Robert Luskin said.Taylor, the U.S. charges d’affaires in Ukraine, told lawmakers in closed-door testimony that “the White House had threatened to withdraw much-needed military aid unless Kyiv announced investigations for Trump’s political benefit.”

Let’s recap what the whistleblower alleged: Trump in a phone call asked Zelensky to “initiate or continue an investigation” into former vice president Joe Biden and his son.“I just thought that they would publish their part.”

Trump’s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, testified to House committees that he believed opening “investigations into Burisma Group — a gas company where Democrat Joe Biden’s son once served on the board — and into alleged 2016 election interference was a condition for a White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky,” according to the Wall Street Journal, which also quoted Sondland’s attorney saying that when the ambassador was “asked by a lawmaker whether that arrangement was a quid pro quo, Mr. Sondland cautioned that he wasn’t a lawyer but said he believed the answer was yes.”

That’s a significant change from what Sondland said last month, when he denied in a text message to Taylor that Trump was engaging in a quid pro quo.Vindman will testify Tuesday about having heard Trump cajole Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a possible 2020 opponent of Trump’s.Taylor said Morrison told him in early September that military aid for Ukraine was being held up until Ukrainian leaders agreed to publicly commit to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his family, as well as a conspiracy theory regarding the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked in 2016.AD

Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, testified that he did not think it was proper for Trump to demand that Ukraine investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden and feared that doing so undermined U.S. national security.AD

For example, Vindman specifically recalled Zelensky referencing Burisma Holdings, one of the largest private natural gas companies in Ukraine, when Trump pushed him to investigate a company related to the Bidens.Hunter Biden had served on the board of Burisma.Vindman also remembers Trump going on about how Joe Biden was on tape boasting about Ukraine funds — most likely referring to comments he made in January 2018 that the United States held up $1 billion in loan guarantees until the nation fired a prosecutor accused of corruption, Viktor Shokin.Kushner also defended his employment in the White House against criticisms from Joe Biden, saying that many of his roles had dealt with “cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind.”

Biden, during an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Sunday, said he would not give his children offices in the White House or spots in Cabinet meetings.And the idea that you’re going to have his children, his — son-in-law, et cetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about,” Biden said.Biden also said Kushner had no “credentials” to be leading the Trump White House’s Middle East policy.— Seung Min Kim

1 p.m.: Trump campaign spokesman argues Vindman offers nothing new

A Trump campaign spokesman became the latest Trump ally to argue that Vindman offered no new consequential information in his opening statement and that there was no quid pro quo between withheld U.S. military aid and Trump’s desire for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.That echoed an earlier tweet Tuesday from Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in which she asserted: “None of these witnesses’ opinions change the key facts.”

She asserted that no Ukrainian said they felt pressured by Trump, that Biden wasn’t investigated and that military aid eventually flowed to Ukraine.You are a disgrace.”

Asked about Vindman, Biden told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell in a phone interview from the campaign trail that it was “despicable to do this to this guy who is a patriot.”

11:15 a.m. McConnell, Schumer spar over Ukraine military aid on Senate floor

McConnell accused Senate Democrats on Tuesday of preparing to hold up military aid to Ukraine, an assertion Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) dismissed as “laughable” during comments on the chamber’s floor.During the impeachment inquiry, House Democrats have highlighted the fact that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was being withheld at the time of Trump’s July call in which he pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.“This is something that we need to get to the bottom of and know how this whole thing started.”

Jordan also argued that there could not be a “quid pro quo” because the Ukrainians took no public actions to free up the military aid that was being withheld at the time Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.His testimony returns repeatedly to his fears that Trump’s manipulation of Ukraine policy to discredit Joe Biden is unethical and damaging to U.S. national security.WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

He said he also raised concerns with the NSC’s legal counsel after a July 10 meeting in which Sondland stressed the importance of having Ukraine investigate the 2016 election as well as Burisma, a company linked to the family of Biden, a top 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.The closing of the Russian-linked accounts — coming a week after Facebook also closed Instagram accounts targeting Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — shows how the company is moving forcefully against foreign sources of disinformation at a time when some critics say it is not doing enough to curb domestic sources.The controversy first arose earlier this month, when former vice president Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the White House, asked Facebook to remove a Trump campaign ad that contained multiple falsehoods.AD

“It would be unfortunate to suggest that the only option available to social media companies … is the full withdrawal of political advertising,” Biden campaign spokesman Bill Russo said about Twitter in a statement, “but when faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out.”

On Wednesday, Twitter executives labored to explain their decision as a matter of principle, acknowledging that political ad spending amounted to less than $3 million during the 2018 midterm elections.First, Trump wanted the Ukrainian president to launch “investigations” to absolve Russia of its role in sabotaging our election in 2016, and help rig the 2020 election by smearing potential opponent Joe Biden.In others, they were not:

AD

The omissions, Colonel Vindman said, included Mr. Trump’s assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr. Biden’s son Hunter.The recording of Biden is probably a reference to this video of Biden talking about working to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor (which doesn’t remotely support the conspiracy theory Trumpworld is spinning).And this doesn’t alter our understanding of this whole story, since Trump has repeatedly referenced this recording and his desire to see the Bidens investigated.It shows that on this call, Trump was more focused on the Bidens — and Zelensky more focused on investigating Burisma — than the summary implied.“But it makes it much harder for Trump to argue that this was about ‘corruption.’ The omitted edits underscore the fact that Trump was singularly focused on the Bidens.”

AD

Note that Trump’s claim that the “transcript” totally exonerates him is central to his demand that Republicans defend him on the substance.Here’s what Trump said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in their July 25 call, according to the rough transcript provided by the White House: “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

Sullivan sought to draw a line between his sentiment and what transpired in Ukraine, suggesting it might be okay if such an investigation was merely a part of a broader anti-corruption push.On Monday evening, the New York Times was first to report that Vindman would be testifying that he was among the officials listening to Trump’s call in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to manufacture smears of former vice president Joe Biden, and he was so troubled that he informed a National Security Council lawyer about it.Trump’s press secretary offered a “fact check” on Twitter, which included Trump mentioning former vice president Joe Biden only once in the call.One involved Trump talking at more length about Biden.If a recording of the call suddenly became public in which Trump tells Zelensky that he’ll give Ukraine Pennsylvania in exchange for an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter, it would take about 24 hours for his most fervent defenders to mush that into their existing framework.From the opening statements of witnesses who have already testified and the reports from the hearing room, we have every reason to believe there are multiple, credible witnesses who tell a consistent story that the president not only solicited help from a foreign power in creating opposition research to attack his rival former vice president Joe Biden but that he conditioned a White House visit and delivery of aid (which he intentionally withheld) to get a public announcement of the investigation.Rob Portman (R-Ohio), an advocate for Ukraine, said, “I thought it was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign government to investigate a political opponent.” But Portman also added: “I also do not think it’s an impeachable offense.”

You would think that an “advocate for Ukraine” would be horrified that the president illegally withheld aid appropriated by Congress so as to extort Ukraine, demanding that its president make a public commitment to provide dirt on former vice president Joe Biden, at a time Ukraine is fighting for its survival against Russia.He argues he did nothing wrong during the July call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.AD

Acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. testified last week that Morrison told him that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. envoy to the European Union, relayed to a top Ukraine aide that the country wouldn’t receive military aid money until the Ukrainian president agreed to pursue an investigation into Joe Biden’s son.“That right there is textbook abuse of power, particularly because at the same moment $391 million in military and security assistance to the Ukraine that was allocated by Congress on a bipartisan basis was being withheld as part of a high-pressure tactic.”

Trump has insisted that there was no “quid pro quo” involving his request to investigate the Bidens and the military aid.Consider first the sliming of Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who raised damaging questions about whether the White House summary of Trump’s phone call with Ukraine’s president omitted a reference to former vice president Joe Biden, whom Trump was pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate.But on Tuesday, Democrats were eager to question one more Trump administration official worried about the president’s move to leverage foreign policy on a promise to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.“I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.For example, Vindman recalled Zelensky specifically referencing the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma when Trump pushed him to investigate a company related to Biden’s son Hunter, who had served on its board.Vindman also remembers Trump going on about how Joe Biden was on tape boasting about Ukraine funds — most likely referring to comments Biden made in January 2018 that the United States held up $1 billion in loan guarantees until the nation fired a corrupt former prosecutor, Victor Shokin.Morrison, tall and lean with an authoritative voice, will be asked to explain that “sinking feeling” he got when Trump demanded that Ukraine’s president investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and meddling in the 2016 election.Morrison’s name appeared more than a dozen times in earlier testimony by William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador in Ukraine, who told impeachment investigators that Trump was withholding military aid unless the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, went public with a promise to investigate Trump’s political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Taylor said Morrison told him security assistance would not materialize until Zelenskiy committed to investigate Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that once employed Biden’s son.“But President Trump did insist that President Zelenskiy go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelenskiy should want to do this himself.Yovanovitch was recalled from her position earlier this year after Giuliani and his associates waged a campaign of unsubstantiated allegations about her being opposed to Trump and supportive of Joe Biden, the former vice president now seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2020.AD

It’s unclear whether Livingston’s efforts were tied directly to those by Giuliani or others in Trump’s circle to oust Yovanovitch and investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.AD

But filings to the Justice Department do show that Livingston made repeated efforts to gain traction for his Ukrainian clients among Trump administration officials now testifying on the administration’s pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.The other eight who will appear onstage in Houston with Biden and Warren, D-Mass., are Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Health and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro; Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.); former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.It’s a vivid contrast to Joe Biden, who at times seems to be observing the debates as much as participating in them.“I am a union man, period,”says Joe Biden.As The Post article details, Biden’s story did have something in common with one episode in 2011, where Biden did pin a medal on a soldier who was emotionally crushed and didn’t think he deserved it.AD

But that soldier and that episode match none of the other details in the story as Biden told it.The other details conform to an entirely different episode, and Biden never pinned a medal on the person at the center of it.AD

Biden brushed off this whole affair in an interview with my Post colleague Jonathan Capehart.In the interview, Biden seemed to confirm that he was talking about the 2011 episode, then said: “Turns out that’s true … that’s what I was talking about.” Biden then allowed that there was another separate incident but didn’t even allow that he had conflated facts from that incident with this one.“I was making the point how courageous these people are,” Biden said, adding: "I don’t know what the problem is.What is it that I said wrong?”

AD

Pressed by Capehart on the fact that there were separate incidents that Biden conflated, he said: “He just confirmed it happened.”

In other words, Biden is saying that because a key element of the story he told was true of another episode — and because that supported his intended meaning and the larger story he was trying to tell — this means getting all these other basic facts wrong, or conflating two episodes in a misleading way, isn’t a serious issue.AD

What’s troubling is Biden genuinely doesn’t seem to see a problem here.AD

But Biden didn’t have to respond this way.Biden could have easily conceded that he should have gotten his facts right, while also saying what he did say, which is that his larger intended point was undiminished and important.Better yet, Biden could respond to this affair by saying, “Let me take the opportunity to tell the story accurately, because this is important,” then tell the correct version, and then reiterate that these stories underscore his reverence for the bravery and sacrifice of these young men.To be clear, my point here isn’t necessarily that Biden’s shaky grasp of the details raises concerns about his age or mental fitness for a grueling campaign, though such concerns are understandable.Biden’s general intentions toward the truth are incalculably better than Trump’s are, and that matters greatly.But Biden himself should.At the very least, one hopes Biden is privately taking from this episode the lesson that it’s important to avoid these kinds of errors in the future, not that nothing whatsoever was wrong here.Maybe Democratic voters won’t end up holding this tendency against Biden at all.But if Biden’s only response to this is to count on that happening, that’s not good enough, either.A Monmouth University poll released this month indicated that the addition of a virtual voting option would expand the lead enjoyed by former vice president Joe Biden in Iowa.In four of six recent polls that broke out African American voters, she found that former vice president Joe Biden leads among African American voters by 19 to 36 points.In the Quinnipiac poll, only four candidates — Biden and Sens.Biden so dominates among African Americans that there is not a plethora of non-Biden black voters.But it’s hard to imagine that if Biden keeps his support among African American voters (not to mention older voters, who overwhelmingly favor him) that someone else can piece together enough votes for the nomination.The media have tended to focus on what happens to the moderate voters if Biden fails, but the more important question is whether any other candidate can dominate among African Americans to the extent Biden has.The assumption is that past is prologue, that Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders will drop out early after a few losses and determine who squares off in the endgame.Suppose this pattern continues — only Biden’s strength among moderate black voters propels him to a South Carolina win while Warren’s weakness there drops her to third or fourth.Joe Biden — 3.One of his main presidential rivals, former vice president Joe Biden, has advanced more modest agenda, setting up a sharp contrast in the contest.A Quinnipiac survey in June showed former vice president Joe Biden leading Trump in Ohio by eight points.AD

New Hampshire is another key early state in the Democratic race — the first one to hold a primary, traditionally eight days after Iowa’s caucuses — and one voter there said she had chosen to spend her entire summer vacation following Joe Biden’s campaign as a volunteer.“I’m having the time of my life,” she said while handing out campaign material at a Biden rally in Keene, N.H. “Right now my job is handing out stickers.For me, at the moment, it’s still got to be Joe Biden.”

AD

Because of the global ramifications of the election, international attention is being showered on the two relatively small states.Standing in the queue for a Biden rally in Keene was Gabriel Gouvea, 29, a Brazilian student at Keene State College who was as excited about the event as the registered Democrats around him, who had traveled from New York.Is there any equivalent thumb for [Joe] Biden?"It seems like Former Vice President Biden is holding fewer interviews/interactions with the media than his competitors — as well as holding fewer events/town halls on the campaign trail.— Anna

Biden's early campaign schedule looked a little light because he followed a playbook other campaigns have abandoned, or at least given the appearance of abandoning: He hit the donor circuit.Since then, Biden has been on the stump about as much as any other candidate.That said, Biden has skipped a few forums that other candidates were open to, mostly ones with questions coming from the left.When pollsters asked about the virtual caucus, the results usually hurt the candidates with stronger Iowa ground networks and helped Joe Biden, whose support is broader but less intense.Joe Biden.Their routes to the nomination depend on winning over current Biden supporters, but his staying power has yet to offer a lasting opportunity to chip away.AD

In response, top advisers to many of his rivals have counseled that the only path forward they see is to continue to cast their candidates as younger, more transformative or more energetic change agents, figure out how to maintain their spot on the debate stage, and hope that the mercurial history of Iowa and New Hampshire voters repeats itself, torpedoing Biden’s bid as they have not.“Between now and then is a lifetime.”

But just what could bring down Biden remains an open question among campaigns.Rather than risk alienating his supporters, they are choosing to build a broader argument about generational or policy change — an implicit contrast to Biden and his central pledge to “restore the soul” of the nation and revisit the popular parts of the Obama administration.AD

“If you take a look at the modern era of presidential campaigns, when Democrats have won, it’s because they’ve taken a bit of a risk, whether it was Kennedy in 1960, or Carter in 1976, or Barack Obama in 2008,” Castro said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press.”

This approach will again be on display at the next debate in Houston on Sept. 12, when Biden will for the first time be confronted by all of his opponents registering in the polls, each of them eager to contrast their visions and styles.will share the center of the stage with Biden after appearing on separate nights over the summer debates and mostly avoiding direct confrontation with him despite a long history of policy disagreement.AD

It remains unclear, however, whether his rivals will repeat the direct assaults on Biden of the first two contests.At several points since he entered the race in April, such efforts against Biden have rewarded his attackers with attention, fundraising bumps and fleeting polling shifts.AD

In the first Democratic debate in June, Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) staked his campaign on demanding that Biden “pass the torch” to younger candidates, only to abandon his presidential effort days later.In the last big moment of her campaign, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) launched an assault on Biden at the July debate, arguing that a 1981 opinion piece he had written showed disrespect for women who work outside the home.AD

Her advisers remain convinced that the confrontation will help her campaign down the road, though since then she has not made Biden a major part of her message.“And we think that will stick in people’s minds for the rest of the primary.”

Part of the challenge for Biden’s detractors is the historically low appetite among Democrats for intraparty fights.AD

AD

Biden, who has run for president twice before, knows this history well and has parried the attacks on him by admitting mistakes over the course of the campaign, including his decision to discuss his past working relationship with segregationist Democratic senators.His aides assert Biden’s longtime relationship with Democratic voters has allowed him to survive the attacks.“When the press or other candidates make a big deal about something he says, they look at it and they roll their eyes,” said John Anzalone, a pollster for the Biden campaign.“Voters know Joe Biden.Sanders has repeatedly tried to use Biden as an establishment foil for his anti-establishment campaign, holding him up as an obstacle to progress.He accused Biden of “sounding like Donald Trump” in July on the subject of health-care policy, and has repeatedly called out Biden’s past support for free-trade deals and the Iraq War and criticized his approach to climate change as insufficient.Warren, by contrast, has taken a far less confrontational approach, not just to Biden but to other Democrats in the race.This is a time of crisis, and when you’re in a crisis — when your back is up against the wall — the last thing you do is back down from the big fights.”

Through the first two sets of debates this summer, Warren and Biden did not appear on the same stage, but that will change in Houston.Asked repeatedly in April about her past fights with Biden over a bill overhauling bankruptcy law, which she opposed and he supported, she was hesitant to go into detail about the split but nonetheless previewed the battle to come.AD

“I think there’s no compromise,” Biden said.AD

Texas’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, supported measures loosening restrictions on weapons, such as those noted by Biden.AD

Biden and other candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination fanned out across the country on Labor Day, nibbling on hot dogs, cheering minor league baseball teams and making a pitch to voters to put them into the nation’s highest political office.This report in the New York Times, titled “Does Joe Biden Want to Be Doing This?,” captures what reporters are witnessing on the campaign trail:

In a tour of about a dozen of these campaign events across the early-voting states during the second half of August, Mr. Biden’s audiences were moderately enthusiastic, always polite and certainly appreciative of his visits.Given their revulsion for the incumbent, many attendees expressed gratitude that Mr. Biden was running for president.AD

AD

And yet, Biden continues to lead in the polls, even if that lead has slipped from around 20 points three months ago to around 10 today.Nothing Biden has done since entering the race shows a candidate more skilled than the one who performed so poorly the last two times he sought the White House.Biden could make a case that as the candidate with the most experience — 36 years in the Senate and eight as an extremely active vice president — he is prepared to do the job more effectively than any other candidate.But while he’s happy to lay that out for you if you ask him, it’s not the way Biden answers the most important question any candidate should be asked: Why are you running?AD

AD

Biden’s answer rests on two pillars.And second, Biden is the Democratic candidate most likely to do that.But if you are unpersuaded by either of those assertions, there’s not much reason to support Biden.My own efforts to get voters to ignore “electability” and just vote for whomever they like will almost certainly fail, but the threat to Biden is not that Democrats will stop worrying about electability but that they’ll decide he isn’t electable after all.But it does mean that a significant number of the people who are now telling pollsters they’re backing Biden could slip away to other candidates if he gives them reason to doubt him.The other day, Biden set what one hopes is his personal best in getting things wrong or, to be quite blunt, almost entirely fictional.As for Biden, he said he had traveled to Konar province, a remote and dangerous part of Afghanistan for the ceremony, waving off warnings.AD

AD

“We can lose a vice president,” Biden said.Biden mixed elements of three different stories.It is the rocking-chair tale of an old man, sure, but it is above all about the sweet humanity of Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., a man no one can hate.AD

Contrast Biden with the megalomaniacal fool in the White House now.Biden must be judged on his own.Biden gets so much wrong.Biden’s problem is not only today, but also tomorrow.And while Biden, who unlike Sir Winston does not have whiskey for breakfast, seems in excellent physical shape, his campaign thus far gives no reassurance that he is of keen mind.AD

You can tell, can’t you, that I like Joe Biden.AD

But as I have written previously, Biden’s unheard campaign tune is “September Song,” an old man’s lament for young love.Neither is Joe Biden.That became clear in 2012 in Newtown after the slaughter of the “beautiful babies,” as Joe Biden called the dead first graders.It’s worth noting that among the Democratic candidates for president, former vice president Joe Biden (full disclosure: my former employer), consistent with his long track record of pulling hard for more union power, strongly supports the PRO Act.But for a campaign that has often touted polls and his perceived electability, it was a unique concession: Biden could afford to lose the first two contests.During Biden’s previous two presidential campaigns, Iowa was a thorn.AD

AD

The state does not line up with Biden’s perceived demographic strengths, lacking a substantial population of black voters, who have provided a strong base of his support nationally and in other early-voting states such as South Carolina.His campaign advisers’ description of his approach to Iowa is similar to one that Biden himself has made, conveying a mixture of humility that he could lose while trying to project strength that he hopes to win.During an Iowa trip last month, Biden told the crowd that he thought the state held “the keys to the kingdom.”

When asked by a reporter as he walked to the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding dinner in Clear Lake whether that meant he viewed the state as a must-win for him, Biden responded: “No.Biden advisers on Tuesday also tried to rebut any concerns by voters that his gaffes are all that significant, saying that voters generally feel that they know him and know what he means even when he makes verbal mistakes.“The newest story line is Biden making gaffes and mistakes.AD

AD

“When I hear that Joe Biden is out of step with the Democratic Party, I look at it and I think he is most representative of the Democratic Party — more than anybody,” one of the Biden advisers said.It’s more ideologically diverse.”

The aides also said the country is looking for the kind of uplifting message that Biden promotes.Biden has a “more optimistic vision,” one senior adviser said.It doesn’t offer a lot of hope or optimism in the future.”

They conceded that Biden’s standing with young voters is not as strong, which they said reflects unfamiliarity with his record.Former vice president Joe Biden conceded tackling the issue may mean a lack of bipartisan compromise."I think there’s no compromise,” Biden said.pic.twitter.com/jwaiO8Ax3A — Adam Brewster (@adam_brew) August 30, 2019

Former Vice President Joe Biden offered a more measured response to reporters over the weekend.The more people that access to vote the better,” Biden said.She’s got the most aggressive antitrust platform of any of the candidates that I’ve seen.” He added that “Biden isn’t nearly as strident as Warren in terms of antitrust.”

A strategic suggestion of vulnerability: The leader in every poll could lose Iowa.But Warrenworld increasingly expects her opponents to ask how she could have stayed inside the party during the Reagan era, when Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were, respectively, leading a resistance in the Senate and attacking the president's foreign and domestic policy from Burlington.Joe Biden greets a supporter after a rally in Davenport, Iowa, last week.Hillary Clinton called half of Donald Trump’s supporters “a basket of deplorables.” Mitt Romney claimed 47 percent of the country would never vote for him because they are “dependent upon government.” Barack Obama said “bitter” working-class people in the Rust Belt “cling to guns or religion.”

Joe Biden’s paean to a bygone era — during which he spoke wistfully about working collegially and civilly with racists to find areas of common ground — seems destined to enter this pantheon of campaign-defining gaffes.Eastland, a Mississippi senator who owned a cotton plantation, described African Americans as an “inferior” race and warned that integration would lead to “mongrelization.” Biden also mentioned Herman Talmadge, the notorious Georgia segregationist who blockaded progress on civil rights for decades.Some of the most vocal criticism came from the two African American senators who are challenging Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination.Cory Booker, who was 3 years old when Biden arrived in the Senate in 1973, said he should apologize.Taking a page from the Trump playbook, Biden took umbrage and demanded that Booker apologize to him for asking him to apologize.It’s past time for apologies or evolution from @JoeBiden.(2/2) — Bill de Blasio (@BilldeBlasio) June 19, 2019

-- The latest donnybrook illustrates why Biden has been the least directly accessible to the press of all the 2020 candidates, including President Trump.Biden has been doing fewer public events than his top-tier rivals, preferring to focus on raising money from high-dollar donors.Biden was the only person who refused to participate.His fundraisers have been mostly open to a press pool, which means that a reporter is allowed in to watch Biden’s speech and email quotes around to other media outlets.Biden can decide to talk about whatever he wants.Hillary Clinton greets Joe Biden on the tarmac at the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in Pennsylvania on Aug. 15, 2016.Biden has a much more tenuous claim to front-runner status than Clinton did at this point.On the other hand, when Biden keeps stepping on rakes, the logic of holding him back makes more sense.But Biden’s lack of accessibility appears to be adversely impacting the tenor of coverage.-- Perhaps more importantly, Biden’s inaccessibility to the press has kept him from answering fundamental questions, such as whether he still supports the death penalty, that voters have a compelling interest in learning the answers to.As a tough-on-crime senator in the 1980s and 1990s, Biden boasted about all the offenses he was trying to make eligible for capital punishment in the crime bill he quarterbacked.During a town hall meeting in New Hampshire earlier this month, a voter asked Biden about criminal justice.As part of his meandering answer, he said offhandedly: “By the way, congratulations to y’all on ending the death penalty here.” A Politico reporter has been asking Biden’s spokespeople whether his views have evolved, and they refused to say either way or shed any light beyond his ambiguous answer.… Mr. Biden declined to take our questions.”

Biden has long been viewed by many liberals as a finger-in-the-wind politician who will be with them primarily when he thinks it makes sense politically.-- Bigger picture, Biden keeps making mistakes that play right into the most potent arguments that his critics on the left and the right can prosecute against him.By highlighting his longevity in Congress — Eastland was first elected to the Senate in the 1940s, for example — Biden gives fodder for the Trump campaign to say that he had a whole career to do what he’s promising and failed.Biden has struggled to talk about his record on issues like busing and integration, which few of the other presidential aspirants ever needed to stake out a position on.-- Another observation: Biden’s demand that Booker apologize to him is a reminder that he has several Trumpian tendencies, from overuse of hyperbole to a reluctance to admit when he’s wrong and a tendency to disregard sage advice from political professionals.Like Trump, Biden is running in many ways to take the country back to what he sees as the good ol' days, which for many folks — especially women and people of color — weren’t so good.Biden’s advisers have heard him privately talk about Eastland before, and they urged him not to do so in public but to use safer examples, like Bob Dole or John McCain.-- “In a separate sign of possible turbulence for Mr. Biden’s candidacy, his campaign experienced the first departure of a prominent political consultant,” Katie Glueck and Astead Herndon report in the Times.“Mark Putnam, a high-profile Democratic strategist and producer of television ads, confirmed in a brief phone call that he had recently left Mr. Biden’s campaign.Mr. Putnam declined to address the reasons for his departure, though they did not appear to be related to Mr. Biden’s struggles over the last few weeks concerning abortion rights and race.”

-- Unlike Trump, Biden has bet his campaign that most Democrats want conciliation more than combat.“That’s how you work with segregationists: by not confronting the racism and their institutionalization of second-class citizenship and a lack of fully recognizing African Americans.”

-- The reaction to Biden’s comments also reflects a generational divide among African American thought leaders.Wesley Lowery, my colleague who was part of the team that earned a Pulitzer for coverage of fatal police shootings, was taken aback that Biden would tell an African American senator to apologize the way he did.Lowery observed that Biden also used Booker’s first name: “Cory should apologize,” he said.It engaged Biden in good faith.Every Democrat on the committee, including Biden, opposed Sessions, as did two GOP senators.The president’s fundraising bonanza this week far eclipsed the $6.3 million that former vice president Joe Biden’s campaign said it pulled in on the day of his late April campaign announcement — the largest 24-hour amount raised by any of the Democratic campaigns this year.”

-- More women of color are writing big checks to campaigns in the hope of changing the makeup of the political donor class, which is dominated by white men.@JoeBiden & them have nothing to do with “bipartisanship,” so please leave GOP out of Democrats’ debates about their party’s troubled history on race.— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) June 19, 2019

As a raft of polls have shown, Biden is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president.When I sat down with Biden for an interview on my Cape Up podcast last week, I asked him whether my impression was right; that what Democrats want most is to send Trump packing.“There is a real passion for getting rid of Donald Trump,” Biden told me.“But I think there is a lot of passion for electing somebody who they think can, in fact, repair the damage that Trump has done, and to actually bring the country back together and unite the country on the basic fundamental things that make America America.” Sure, Biden thinks he is that person, and that’s why he’s leading the crowded Democratic field.“That’s why I think you see the response to the soul-of-America argument I’m making,” he continued, “because they know how deeply I feel it.”

But later in the interview, Biden said he didn’t think he was the only one who could retake the White House.“I think there’s other people in the race who can beat Trump,” admitted Biden.AD

AD

Just before he and I talked, The Post published an article about the latest gaffe to hit Team Biden.This time it was a report that dismantled a favorite story Biden tells about pinning a medal on a member of the military.After pounding the table while recounting the tale in almost exasperated tones, Biden stared me right in the eyes and said, “I don’t know what the problem is.I told him the latest gaffe fed into the narrative that some worry Biden is too old or isn’t all there.“Voters are making up their own minds about what’s important in Biden’s performance and what’s not,” Robinson wrote in his Monday column.“I think they’re looking for ‘electability,’ whatever that means; they’re looking for a fighter who won’t back down; and they’re looking for leadership.” And this contention was best exemplified by Alfonso Burris, 70, of Rock Hill and Alonzo White Jr., 66, from Dalton, Ga.

Before the Biden town hall kicked off, I asked them why they were there.Burris was totally for Biden.“I’m just here to see what he has to say and the plans he has for the country, moving it forward and bringing us together,” White said, “because we are the United States of America, not the divided states of America, which is what President Trump is doing.” But was his presence at the Biden town hall a tacit statement of support?AD

AD

“I haven’t fully decided yet,” said White, who did say that he was leaning more toward Biden than anyone else.Biden has been embellishing and falsifying a story he’s been telling for years about traveling to Afghanistan and pinning a Silver Star on a Navy captain.Biden said in response.“The details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making,” Biden told NPR and Iowa Public Radio over the weekend while campaigning in Iowa.AD

AD

“That has nothing to do with judgment of whether or not you send troops to war, the judgment of whether you bring someone home, the judgment of whether you decide on a health-care policy,” Biden said in the interview.But Biden’s mistelling of a story he often repeats is a bigger story than it might have been in other years.To that end: Do voters give Biden a pass on his own factual inaccuracies?Or do Democratic voters, increasingly focused on electability, become concerned Biden won’t have the moral authority to take on a central feature of Trump?Biden is arguing that his untruthfulness is not a defining part of how he leads.Biden has also framed his entire campaign around beating Trump, from his very first campaign announcement.Biden recently said that he might not be running for president were it not for Trump.Former vice president Joe Biden turns the knife: “I’ve seen nothing, the president has no intestinal fortitude to deal with this.The Washington Post reported last week that Biden had recently told an audience in New Hampshire about a general who asked him during Biden’s tenure as vice president to travel to Afghanistan to award a Silver Star to a Navy captain who was reluctant to receive it.AD

AD

It appears that Biden, who has a history of gaffes, jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story that never happened.Biden visited Afghanistan as a senator.Biden, who initially contended that the details were correct in his retelling, told NPR that inaccuracies were “irrelevant to the point.”

“It’s like saying, ‘I had this very bright reporter, and I think her eyes were blue,’” Biden said.It’s irrelevant, and you know it.”

AD

During an appearance Monday in Iowa, Biden was pressed by reporters about whether details matter in his retelling of stories.And I wasn’t trying to mislead anybody,” Biden said ahead of a Labor Day picnic in Cedar Rapids.(Former vice president Joe Biden’s plan, for example, imagines spending $1.7 trillion in federal investment and $5 trillion in total, including investment from state and local governments and the private sector.)AD

Given that Sanders and Warren’s combined support in most polls either approaches or slightly exceeds Biden’s.Surveys show a not insignificant number of his supporters would turn to Biden — hardly a proponent of revolutionary change — if he pulled out.To debate the merits of Sanders vs. Warren while Biden maintains a commanding lead is a fight made for social media, where opinion is routinely passed off as fact and minor differences of opinion have a way of turning into major fights.Eight of the Democratic candidates initially accepted CNN's invitation to discuss this critically important issue: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and businessman Andrew Yang.Biden’s plan targets a 100 percent clean energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.Biden has not explained his position and has been criticized by environmental groups for having a senior adviser tied to the fossil fuel industry.They have also promised to commit money to deploying technologies: Warren at $1.5 trillion and Biden at $1.3 trillion.In the hints department, Mattis has taken to referencing his pointed resignation letter and saying things such as: “I don’t know how I could have spoken more loudly to where I stand than what I put in my letter of resignation and quitting a job when I had not completed it two years in.” Asked about Trump’s infamous tweet taking Kim Jong Un’s side in criticizing former vice president Joe Biden, he responded to the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg:

Mattis looked at his hands.Meanwhile, in the same poll, former vice president Joe Biden leads Trump in a general election match-up 54 percent to 42 percent.According to RealClearPolitics, Biden’s average lead in the polls is more than nine points.Joe Biden's uneasy answer to a question about a fundraiser with a natural gas company founder emphasized how much Democrats were being pressured to turn down “dirty” money, something that has grown in salience for liberal voters since the 2016 primary.“You can’t tell me we can’t figure out how to burn coal that we mine right here in the United States of America and make it work.”

No Democrat, not even Joe Biden, talks like that anymore.“No one is going to build another coal-burning [plant]," Biden said.“We've got to shut down the ones down we have, but no one is going to build a new one.” Later, when asked if he would ban hydraulic fracturing (or “fracking”) Biden gave a reeling answer (“we could pass national legislation, but I don't think we'd get it done”) before saying he would “would not allow any more” exploration for natural gas.In September, a tighter framing of the question finds something increasingly familiar in this primary: A combined but divided vote for the left-wing candidates (Elizabeth Warren and Sanders) that's larger than the vote for the “moderate lane” candidates, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg.In this poll, Sanders leads with 34 percent in the city of Milwaukee, with Biden trailing at 31 percent and Warren far behind at 6 percent.The question: How much of this is because of name ID in a state where only Biden and Sanders are universally known?The premise of Joe Biden’s candidacy is that he’ll do best among non-college-educated whites.And Isaac Larkin, a 27-year-old Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern, caused a stir when he asked former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., “How can we trust you to hold these corporations and executives accountable for their crimes against humanity when we know that tomorrow you are holding a high-dollar fund-raiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, a fossil fuel executive?”

Both the moderator, Anderson Cooper, and Mr. Biden pointed out that Mr. Goldman, a co-founder of a natural gas production company, has no current role with the firm.But the question forced Mr. Biden to use much of his 40-minute segment to explain how his link to Mr. Goldman did not violate his pledge to avoid donations from the fossil fuel industry.Mr. Biden said he opposed new drilling on federal lands but not a nationwide ban.Biden getting lost in his own mind about whether the guy hosting his fundraiser was or was not, in fact, a fossil fuel industry insider.When I think of Biden voters, I see a middle-aged, churchgoing African American woman in South Carolina or a white retiree in Florida.They are risk-averse when it comes to finding a candidate to beat President Trump and assume that Biden is the most electable (look at the polls!).They aren’t going to leave Biden unless they develop grave doubts about his ability to beat Trump.Warren and Sanders don’t really speak to the Biden voter, and Biden voters by and large aren’t going to roll the dice on Sanders or even Warren.AD

AD

Buttigieg’s hope rests with Biden’s collapse and the decline of Warren.That’s a big reason that Biden still leads and why the chattering class cannot quite grasp why.Castro, Klobuchar and former vice president Joe Biden defended their opposition to a nationwide ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, used to extract otherwise hard-to-reach natural gas.Biden, meanwhile, suggested he doesn’t think there are enough votes “to get it done” in Congress.Biden was also grilled by an audience member about a fundraiser for him Thursday hosted by a co-founder, Andrew Goldman, of a natural gas company Western LNG, even after promising to not take money from fossil-fuel executives.Biden said Goldman wasn’t an executive at the company.Biden’s standing there is likely to bolster his campaign’s argument that he is the most electable Democrat against Trump.The poll also finds Biden the best positioned in the Democratic primary.“He’s not a fossil-fuel executive, I’m told,” Biden replied.Within minutes a metaphor would inflame Biden’s left eye, in the form of an apparent subconjunctival hemorrhage.“There’s not a damn thing we can’t do,” Biden said.The Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt told POLITICO that “a lot of reporting goes into most of our editorials, and it’s not that rare for us to break news, on local or national stories.” | Alex Wong/Getty Images Media Washington Post editorial quietly broke open Trump’s Ukraine scandal

The White House’s release of a readout of President Donald Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president largely vindicates a Washington Post editorial from Sept. 5 that first revealed that Trump had pressured Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden.Story Continued Below

In the piece, The Post’s editorial board described being “reliably told” that Trump “is attempting to force” Zelensky “to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of” Biden.And the Sept. 5 editorial came well before the Wall Street Journal turbocharged the scandal by reporting on Sept. 20 that Trump had repeatedly pressured Zelensky about Biden.“Our Washpost editorial looks at what could be our next election scandal: Trump’s attempt to extort Ukraine’s new government into investigating Joe Biden,” Diehl tweeted at 8:50 p.m. on Sept. 5.And the White House on Wednesday further backed up the editorial’s reporting by releasing a memorandum of a July phone call in which Trump urged Zelensky to speak with Attorney General William Barr and personal Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani about investigating Biden.Since May, Giuliani has suggested Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in March 2016 to benefit his son Hunter Biden’s business interests in the country, claims for which there is no evidence to support.“In a sweeping complaint, state and federal regulators alleged Google knew that some channels on YouTube were popular among young viewers and tracked kids’ viewing habits for the purpose of serving them targeted ads, ultimately raking in ‘close to $50 million’ from just a short list of channels that violated federal children’s privacy laws … While the fine set a record for a violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the federal law that forbids the tracking of users under 13 without parental permission, it amounted to less than two days’ worth of profits for the tech giant, advocates noted.”

Biden set to return to Wall Street: “Former Vice President Joe Biden is heading back to Wall Street for two fundraisers Thursday, the day after he participates in a climate change town hall,” CNBC’s Brian Schwartz reports.“Biden will be hosted on Thursday by real estate executive Jack Rosen and his wife, Phyllis, for a cocktail party, with tickets at $2,800, according to people with direct knowledge with the matter.Rosen is the CEO of Rosen Partners and president of the American Jewish Congress, a group dedicated to defending Jewish interests in the U.S. and abroad … That same day, Biden will be heading to the home of investment banker David Solomon, the invitation says.Solomon is a partner at family run investment firm Hildred Capital Partners.”

One of the co-hosts is raising eyebrows: “The day after [Biden] participates in CNN’s climate forum in New York, the former vice president will head to a high-dollar fundraiser co-hosted by a founder of a fossil fuel company,” the Intercept’s Akela Lacy reports.“Andrew Goldman, a co-founder of Western LNG, a natural gas production company based in Houston, Texas, is co-hosting one of two high-dollar fundraisers Biden will attend in New York on Thursday.There’s also an added wrinkle — what did Biden, who is not especially precise in his phrasing, mean with his comment?AD

AD

The Facts

When we first watched this clip, we assumed that Biden was comparing the number of military personnel killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan over the course of the two wars — nearly 5,400 — with the number of veterans of those conflicts who have taken their own lives.Before he made this statement, Biden said: “Every year for the last 13 years I have wanted to know I call every morning to the Defense Department, not a joke, to learn exactly how many women and men have been killed in Afghanistan or Iraq.AD

Biden continued: “Know how many are coming back with post-traumatic stress?AD

Then Biden said: “To deal with the VA [Veterans Affairs] and fund it, which this guy is not doing very well about it.Because they can’t get help.”

So, it’s possible Biden was referring to the past five or so years, when total deaths in the conflicts, not just those killed in action, has ranged from 27 to 37 a year, even as the number of suicides of veterans has continued to climb.AD

The Biden campaign pointed to the most recent Veterans Affairs report, dated 2016, but unfortunately it does not distinguish between veterans who served in various conflicts.It’s certainly hard to confirm Biden’s claim that the suicides per month exceed KIAs “by a long shot,” given how many veterans who killed themselves may not have been deployed.AD

That brings us to the more-generous interpretation of Biden’s remarks.AD

“Vice President Biden was highlighting the urgent need to end the tragic epidemic of suicide among veterans and service members,” Michael Gwin, the Biden campaign’s deputy rapid-response director, said in a statement.As President, Joe Biden would build on the work of the Obama-Biden Administration to support veterans by continuing to reform the VA and ensure that everyone who has served our country in uniform has access to quality health care — including treatment for PTSD, substance use disorders, and other behavioral health issues.”

The Pinocchio Test

Given the fuzziness of the data, and the imprecision in Biden’s remarks, we are going to leave this unrated.Biden was pressed on a number of topics: “Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden was hit with what was probably the toughest question of the night: How can he be trusted to stand up to fossil fuel companies when he has plans to attend a fund-raiser tomorrow hosted by Andrew Goldman, a co-founder of Western LNG, a liquefied natural gas production company,” the New York Times's Lisa Friedman reports.“Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden was hit with what was probably the toughest question of the night: How can he be trusted to stand up to fossil fuel companies when he has plans to attend a fund-raiser tomorrow hosted by Andrew Goldman, a co-founder of Western LNG, a liquefied natural gas production company,” the New York Times's Lisa Friedman reports.That time is far better spent trying to get Warren and Biden to engage with each other on economic issues, or to see Klobuchar spar with Bernie Sanders over whether far-left idealism or liberal pragmatism is the future of the party.For now, the race remains largely as it was just after Joe Biden entered the primaries in April.But the goodwill Biden enjoys in the party will probably keep him as the polling front-runner, albeit a vulnerable one, until voters weigh in next year.If neither happens, Biden’s chances of becoming the nominee soar.For either to do well, Biden will need to falter.Joe Biden — 3.Henry Olsen: Don’t trust candidates who ignore nuclear power

Amid an outcry from environmentalists, Joe Biden defended his attendance at a fundraiser co-hosted by a co-founder of a natural gas company — at the event itself.Biden told donors gathered Thursday evening in a 30th-floor Upper West Side apartment in New York overlooking Central Park he is committed to refusing campaign contributions from fossil fuel executives, consistent with a pledge to environmental activists.“I just want to be very clear to everyone here,” Biden said, according to a pool report.Biden's struggle to respond highlights the increasing potency of environmental issues in the 2020 Democratic race as all of the major candidates have for the first time promised to reject donations from producers of fossil fuels, which scientists believe are the main contributor to climate change.Environmental activists who succeeded in getting Biden to sign the “No Fossil Fuel Money” pledge concede the former vice president did not technically break the letter of the agreement.“Biden holding a fundraiser organized by a natural gas company co-founder and getting advice from individuals raking in millions from fossil fuels makes it hard for young people to trust he's serious about this commitment,” said Stephen O'Hanlon, spokesman for the Sunrise Movement, one of several green groups that have hounded candidates to sign the anti-fossil fuel pledge.Biden and 17 other presidential candidates have signed the pledge as many of the candidates themselves increasingly see the issues of growing climate-warming emissions and the outsized influence of wealthy fossil-fuel donors as inextricably linked.On Wednesday, Biden seemed to be caught off guard when asked by an activist why he was planning to attend a fundraising event hosted by Goldman.The Houston-based Western LNG, as reported by the Intercept just hours before Biden got onstage, is trying to build a floating liquefied natural gas facility off the coast of British Columbia designed to get Canadian gas to Asia.At first, Biden dismissed the connection between Goldman, who once served as an adviser to Biden in the Senate, and the natural gas business.“He is not a fossil fuel executive,” Biden said.Biden went on to note that Goldman wasn't included as one of the firm's executives in official Securities and Exchange Commission filings.“If you look at the SEC filings, he's not listed as one of those executives,” Biden said.The question to Biden during the CNN forum was orchestrated by the Sunrise Movement.One of the volunteers from its Chicago chapter, Isaac Larkin, said he originally planned to ask Biden about the oil industry's efforts to spread doubt about climate change.The Biden campaign declined to comment, though a campaign official noted Goldman is not involved in the company's day-to-day operations and is not on the company's board.At the Thursday fundraiser, Biden reiterated that he regards climate change as "an existential threat."In June, Biden published a climate plan aiming to achieve net-zero climate-warming emissions by no later than the middle of the century.Without naming names, Biden suggested the climate plans from some of his 2020 rivals are unrealistic.AD

The calendar also worked against his ambitions, complicating Schultz’s commitment to withdraw his candidacy before a general election if a centrist like former vice president Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination.This suggests that the Schultz constituency, such as it is, is identical to the Biden constituency.These people are looking to beat Trump and fuel Joe Biden’s campaign.Schultz was never going to beat Biden, and his unwillingness to run as a Democrat in the hope Biden might falter doomed his chances from the start.We know, by Mr. Trump’s own admission, that he hectored the newly elected president of Ukraine to interfere in his own law enforcement apparatus in order to produce compromising material on former vice president Joe Biden or his son.Mr. Trump and his cringing Cabinet enablers are scrabbling furiously to obscure that truth by throwing out lies about the Bidens, pretending that the Trump phone call was normal and ethical and, maybe most contemptibly, impugning the patriotism of the whistleblower.For example, Jill Biden was against her husband running for president in 2004.She fumed as Joe Biden spent hours in their living room listening to a group of Democrats explain how he could beat George W. Bush.But we’re reliably told that the president has a second and more venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of [Joe Biden].The strong-arming of Mr. Zelensky was openly reported to the New York Times last month by Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said he had met in Madrid with a close associate of the Ukrainian leader and urged that the new government restart an investigation of Mr. Biden and his son.… The Biden case, which has already been investigated by Ukrainian authorities, is bogus on its face.”

I’m not saying that Biden is infallible or that he will definitely win the nod.“If people are looking for a safe harbor, it’s Joe Biden.Biden, the former vice president, was the first presidential candidate to address the convention, and he hit many of the same themes that he’s talked about before in his campaign.Biden made an emotional appeal to stand up to a president he feels is “more similar to George Wallace than George Washington.”

AD

Biden’s speech was met with polite applause, but his supporters said it’s a mistake to read too much into crowd reaction.“I’ll tell you what, I’d much rather have Joe, who maybe makes a misstatement now and then than a president who lied to the American people virtually every day,” said Harold A. Schaitberger, who leads the International Association of Firefighters and came with a large contingent of union members to cheer for Biden.AD

He downplayed the outward shows of enthusiasm for other candidates: “The voting population within the Democratic Party, I believe, resides in the lane that Joe Biden commands.”

But in a reminder of why some Democrats are concerned, Biden drew chuckles from the crowd when he misstated the president’s name during his speech here.“If Donald Hump — if Donald Trump is reelected, Freudian slip, if Donald Trump is reelected he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation,” Biden said.AD

Biden’s verbal miscues prompted one competitor, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), to question the former vice president’s fitness for office.In an interview published by Bloomberg News, Ryan said he believes Biden is “declining.” On Saturday, when pressed by reporters, Ryan said: “I’m just saying that it’s unclear sometimes when he is articulating positions.There’s a lack of clarity, and I’ll leave it at that.”

AD

Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman with Biden’s campaign, declined to comment on Ryan’s remarks.Was a campaign that has talked as much as Biden’s has about its candidate’s standing in the polls and electability against President Trump suddenly trying to lower expectations?Was a campaign that has insisted Biden is soundly and durably positioned in the race, that he is anything but the vulnerable front-runner often portrayed in the press, now backing off from making Iowa a clear test of strength for his rivals?What the Biden adviser — the ground rules for the conference call specified that no one could be identified by name — said was in many ways obvious.Yet, for Biden, there may be no good reason to start down the road of declaring states dispensable.AD

No one knows what fate awaits Biden.That’s the model Biden would prefer to emulate.Like Biden, he was four years out of the vice presidency.Also like Biden, his campaign was built on a strong résumé, endorsements and long-standing ties to major party constituencies and party leaders.AD

So are Iowa and New Hampshire must-wins for Biden, who claims front-runner status in the Democratic race?But even though this is Biden’s third campaign for the White House, his personal history offers few clues.He dropped out after that loss but said, “I ain’t going away.”

There are obvious, if imperfect, parallels between Biden’s campaign and Mondale’s.As it happened, shortly before Biden was to speak to the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention Saturday morning, Gary Hart was in the bowels of the arena where party activists were gathering for a day of speeches from the candidates.“I would encourage all of you not to pay too much attention to polls now.”

Hart served with Biden in the Senate and said his endorsement of Bennet was not a knock on the former vice president.The Biden team has said it expects the nomination race to last many months after Iowa and New Hampshire.Joe Biden's occasional curse words were a focus during the 2012 campaign (remember "BFD"?).Former vice president Joe Biden is running to “restore the soul” of the country to the pre-Donald Trump era.In his Iowa ad, which features an image of Buttigieg during his 2014 tour of duty in Afghanistan with the Navy Reserve, he presents himself as a calm, fresh-faced outsider from Washington offering “real solutions, not more polarization.”

AD

He has echoed that message on the trail in recent weeks, refining his vague “Win the Era” slogan to an argument meant to more firmly position him as a next-generation change agent, with center-left policy views like Biden and an urgency to shake up the system more reminiscent of Warren and Sanders, the liberal disrupters in the race.I think, as in those days, the voters in Iowa and New Hampshire are just beginning to look at these candidates and make up their minds about whom they want to elect.”

Bennet is one of 10 Democrats in the race who did not qualify for this week's debates in Houston; seven of the candidates who did qualify are gasping for airtime in a race increasingly dominated by former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).If this sounds familiar, there's a reason: Most of these candidates entered the race thinking that Biden would falter and found voters seemingly ready for a “fresh face” or “generational change.” There has never been a field this large before, weakening the effort of Bennet and others to hark back to prior races.But there has never been an early favorite as old as Biden, who will turn 77 this year.Biden’s rivals argue that it’s a mistake to assume his lead will hold; some voters agree that they like him but say they are listening to the alternatives.“He's honest, he's not corrupt, he's got the experience, but he's a little past his prime,” James Townsend, 73, said after stopping at Biden's booth outside the convention hall.Saturday's events demonstrated why so many candidates still saw a path past Biden.Biden worked the private room of union members for about 30 minutes; even then, some in the room said they admired Biden but were still shopping for a candidate.“I'm looking for a moderate Democrat,” said Elliot Lasky, a 74-year-old activist who had co-hosted house parties for Biden, Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker of new Jersey.Joe brings a message of being Uncle Joe, of comfort, of stability.”

Biden has talked about his strong poll numbers and relished how pundits lowballed his popularity with Democrats.“I understand the argument that your industry makes about the energy that shows up, the crowds,” said IAFF President Harold Schaitberger, referring to the media reporting on Biden's modestly sized crowds."[But] the voting population within the Democratic Party, I believe, resides in the lane that Joe Biden commands.”

The reception Biden has gotten in New Hampshire — warm, polite and modest — has his rivals looking for the inevitable breakthrough.“The polls today are not how the race is going to end,” Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) told reporters at the convention, arguing that Biden was not as “sharp” as the party's nominee needed to be.“Biden and Warren, longtime frenemies, will finally meet in a debate chasing the biggest prize of all,” by Annie Linskey and Matt Viser

Another week, another big delta between Democratic voters' personal preference and their expectation of who other people might vote for.The subgroup most likely to see Biden as electable is Democratic women: A full 48 percent of them believe Biden has the best shot, while just 17 percent of them pick one of the female candidates.But despite Biden's vast experience, just one in four primary voters believe he'd be best in the job.That's what every rival is watching as Biden defends his lead: What happens to the voters who support Biden but believe a rival would be better at the job?Since the network's last survey in July, Biden's organization has caught up, in sheer staff numbers, with Warren and Sanders; Biden has also beaten the other two candidates to TV, though every candidate is starting the air war later than in previous cycles.While 46 percent of voters say they would be enthused to see Warren lead the ticket, and 38 percent say that for Sanders, just 28 percent say it of Biden.She won the support of Ray Mabus, Barack Obama's secretary of the Navy, and the first high-ranking Obama official (besides Castro) to favor a rival candidate over Biden.Continuing her not-very-subtle jab at former vice president Joe Biden, she told the crowd: “We can’t ask other people to vote for someone we don’t believe in.Clearly, she has energized the base in a way Biden has not.Contributions,

In a paper in the Harvard Women’s Law Review in 2002, she argued that with his “presidential ambitions growing,” women’s groups should oppose Biden because the bill would disproportionately harm women.The two clashed again in 2005 when the bankruptcy bill made it to the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Biden was a senior member.AD

Biden referred to Warren as “professor” twice and, before she spoke, characterized her argument as “very compelling and mildly demagogic.”

AD

He asked who should foot the bill when consumers can’t pay.“Is it the responsibility of the gas company and the drugstore and whoever else you name to make sure that these people do not have to make these hard choices?” Biden asked.In the bankruptcy fight, Biden was representing his state’s interests.AD

“What I got to see was a relationship that was really forged on respect,” said Terrell McSweeny, a former Biden aide.Some liberal Democrats still say Biden is too close to corporate interests, and some moderates say they are uncomfortable with Warren’s attacks on the status quo.“And I said, ‘No, I think she wants your job, but she knows she’s got to start somewhere.’ ”

It is unclear whether Biden played a role in recommending or discouraging Warren’s appointment as leader of the CFPB.“You gave me hell,” Biden joked to Warren, referring to their previous skirmishes.That fits Biden’s tendency to view political adversaries as friendly opponents rather than implacable enemies, Kaufman said

“I think at the end of the day, it’s entirely consistent with the way Vice President Biden approaches relationships,” McSweeny said.As they dined without aides present, Biden hinted at the possibility of the two joining forces on a ticket, a development that set Washington abuzz for weeks, according to news reports.Biden did not run that year, and the 21st Century Cures Act that contained his cancer-fighting provision passed shortly after the election.It makes it easier to imagine how Joe Biden might not merely survive questions about whether he touched women in ways that made them feel uncomfortable, but might even emerge essentially unscathed.This election cycle, Mr. Biden might be the beneficiary of such sentiment.It would end the federal sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine — a disparity created by legislation sponsored by Mr. Biden, who has since apologized.(APPLAUSE)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice President Joe Biden.And, Vice President Biden, the differences between you and the senators on either side of you tonight strike at the heart of this primary debate.(APPLAUSE)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice president Biden...

KLOBUCHAR: If I could respond, George.Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered.But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in.Vice President Biden, you have a plan to release many nonviolent drug offenders from prison.Vice President Biden, I do want to direct this to you, because we all remember Sandy Hook.In recent days former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders, "Some really talented people are seeking the nomination.Biden saying, "There's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say 'I'm going to eliminate assault weapons,'" saying, "you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order."Vice President Biden, do you still stand by what you said on an executive order?Vice President Biden, as a presidential candidate, in 2008, you supported the border wall, saying, "Unlike most Democrats, I voted for 700 miles of fence."RAMOS: Secretary Castro, would you want to respond to Vice President Biden?But my problem with Vice President Biden — and Cory pointed this out last time — is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that's me, too, and then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, well, that was the president.I mean...

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Vice President Biden, you have — you have 45 seconds.We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for our economic and social dynamism, and I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama-Biden administration.I got to say to my good friend, Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade.STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice President Biden, he invoked your name.I want to turn to Vice President Biden, because the concerns about any possible vacuum being created in Afghanistan, if you pulled the U.S. troops out, has been heightened by what we've seen in recent days on the ground in Iraq.Vice President Biden?Senator Biden, we'll start the clock again.“And I said, ‘Well, at least that’s something that’s still working!’”

Hart, elected to the Senate two years after Biden, was a dark horse in 1984 but entered the 1988 cycle as a favorite.Biden also ran that year.“I believe that I can go to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania,” said the former housing secretary, “and then go get the 29 electoral votes in Florida, expand the map into Arizona, Texas and Georgia and then beat Trump.”

A reporter asked why Biden, who was on the ticket in 2008 as Obama’s running mate, wouldn’t be the best candidate to reassemble that coalition.Tim Ryan, 46, told Bloomberg News that “Biden is declining” in what he later said he thought was a fundraising call and not a media interview.… It’s unclear sometimes, when he’s articulating positions, there’s a lack of clarity, and I’ll leave it at that.”

Joe Biden holds a town hall meeting on Friday in Laconia, N.H. (Mary Schwalm/AP)

-- Biden embraces his half century in public life and touts experience as an asset.On a chilly, overcast and windy Friday afternoon that felt like autumn, Biden held a town hall on the Atlantic Ocean in New Castle.“He’s smarter than I was when I was 19,” Biden said.… Your generation is fundamentally changing things.”

Then Rebecca Beaulieu, 24, who graduated from college last year and now works as a paid environmental activist, pressed Biden on why he attended a fundraiser in New York the night before that was co-hosted by Andrew Goldman, who helped start a natural gas company called Western LNG.“He did found a fossil fuel company, but he’s not on the board or any of it,” Biden replied.Does that disqualify you to being engaged?”

Biden went on to offer an extended defense of his environmental record, citing a string of bills he authored dating all the way back to his two years as a Delaware county councilman in the early 1970s.But I want you look in my eyes,” Biden said.It may be 2045.”

The crowd applauded as Biden made the pledge, but the young woman who asked the question was unsatisfied.I’m actively doing something.”

Jess Elliott, on the other hand, thought Biden handled all the questions deftly.He supports Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, because he wants America to be respected again by our allies and feared by our adversaries.“He’s straightforward as hell,” Elliott said of Biden.I believe he’s honestly trying to help our country.”

Independents like Elliott, who lives in Exeter, are why Biden leads in the early polls, which in turn bolsters the former vice president’s case that he’s the candidate best positioned to defeat Trump.-- Eric Swalwell, 38, most forcefully made the generational argument against Biden during the first debate in June.The congressman noted that, when he was only 6 years old, Biden called for passing the torch to a new generation of leaders during a 1987 speech to the California Democratic Party.If we want to end gun violence and solve student debt, pass the torch.” Biden rolled his eyes.The dividing line between Joe Biden and his challengers.”

” Glenn Kessler fact checked Biden’s claim that he opposed the Iraq War from the “moment it started,” and the candidate’s staff acknowledges that he misspoke.Our colleagues Annie Linskey and Matt Viser wrote an incredible recap of their relationship, including their fierce disagreement over bankruptcy legislation in the late '90s and early 2000s along with Warren’s lonely fight against legislation that contained Biden’s cancer Moonshot initiative.Point one was brought home last month in conversations at my family barbecue in North Carolina and at former vice president Joe Biden’s town hall that I attended in Rock Hill, S.C. Having plans and vision is great, but surefire applause lines involve tearing into Trump for the damage he has done the nation at home and abroad.This is what Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) did in the first debate when he went after Biden.“That candidate was then-senator Joe Biden.Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago.The junior senator from New York used a 1981 op-ed by Biden, then a senator from Delaware, to accuse him of arguing that working mothers were destroying the American family.GILLIBRAND: I want to address Vice President Biden directly.So under Vice President Biden’s analysis, am I serving in Congress resulting in the deterioration of the family, because I had access to quality affordable day care?If you actually read the Biden op-ed, as I wrote after that debate, you see that the argument about the deterioration of the family had nothing to do with “allowing more women to work” and everything to do with the rich gaining on the backs of working families.Biden then, as he did at the July debate, was bemoaning a child-care tax credit that was being made available to upper-income Americans.Biden wrote about how he tried to make them ineligible and why.And I’m going to now direct this at Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist, and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.But the initial remarks highlighted above were a devastating knock against Biden that in the short term was enormously beneficial.Harris’s attack on Biden for opposing court-ordered busing in the 1970s got muddled as she answered questions about what she would do today.By the time she took the debate stage on July 31, where she went on the attack against Biden again, her support was back down to around 10 percent.“Let’s close the transportation divide by investing in infrastructure and yes, getting commuter rail to Manchester and beyond.”

If former vice president Joe Biden is grave in denouncing Trump’s character, Klobuchar is lively and funny.Biden, who is testing whether enthusiasm is a necessity in a presidential primary, is beloved but compares poorly at times to more dynamic speakers, and that includes Klobuchar.Last month, on the presidential campaign trail, former vice president Joe Biden also advocated for creating such an agency.During an Aug. 8 speech at the Iowa State Fair, Biden said creating a HARPA agency could help solve health problems including Alzheimer’s and obesity.— Former vice president Joe Biden, in remarks during the second Democratic presidential primary debate, July 31

More than 16 years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, former vice president Joe Biden continues to struggle with explaining his 2002 Senate vote that gave President George W. Bush the authority to launch the war.AD

In recent weeks, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination has stated that, despite that vote, he opposed the Iraq War from the “moment it started.” But a review of Biden’s statements from the 2002-2003 period finds that although he was certainly a critic, sometimes a farsighted one, of Bush’s handling of the war effort, he did not forthrightly oppose the conflict once it started.After our inquiries on these statements, Antony Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state who is a senior campaign adviser, told The Fact Checker that Biden misspoke.Blinken was staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under Biden during the period in question.The Facts

As the then-chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden had a key role in the debate surrounding a possible war with Iraq.Biden agreed that intelligence showed this was the case — although it later turned out to be hyped and incorrect — but he repeatedly emphasized that an international diplomatic effort was necessary to ensure the return of weapons inspectors.Biden, working with Sens.Biden, during the Senate debate on Oct. 10, 2002, argued that the resolution was designed to ensure diplomacy.“The reason for my saying not two steps now is it strengthens his hand, in my view, to say to all the members of the Security Council: ‘I just want you to know, if you do not give me something strong, I am already authorized, if you fail to do that, to use force against this fellow,’ ” Biden argued on the Senate floor.Biden insisted: “I do not believe this is a rush to war.Nevertheless, Biden continued to express support for his vote.Five months after the congressional vote, when the war started, Biden said he was disappointed that Bush decided to go to war without U.N. authorization or much international backing.AD

AD

“Back in August, wittingly or unwittingly, the president accepted two totally incompatible strategies,” Biden told The Washington Post on the eve of the invasion.That was the position taken by Senate liberals that Biden had previously dismissed during the debate about the war resolution.But once the invasion started on March 20, Biden expressed support for military action, couching it as support for the troops.After that, Biden repeatedly expressed support for the war and its goals, while disagreeing with the administration’s tactics, especially its plans to rebuild Iraq.In a March 27 floor statement calling for a massive reconstruction effort, Biden said to allies that had declined to participate: “This Senator and many others may disagree — profoundly — with the choice they have made.” But he added, “We could not come together in war, but we are going to have to come together in peace.”

AD

AD

The pattern continued:

April 7, ABC’s “This Week”: Biden warned of “a prescription for disaster” if the administration permitted Iraqi exile Ahmed Chalabi, a favorite of Vice President Richard B. Cheney, a prominent role in the emerging Iraqi government.May 22, Senate hearing: Biden challenged Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to be honest about the cost and length of occupation: “When is the president going to tell the American people that we’re likely to be in the country of Iraq for three, four, five, six, eight, 10 years, with thousands of forces and spending billions of dollars?I also said at the time, as far back as August, that I thought the administration was exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction.”

June 29, interview on “Fox News Sunday”: Question after Biden says the intelligence was exaggerated: “So you think, looking back on it, still, that it was a just war, in your opinion?” Biden responded: “Oh, I do think it was a just war.”

July 10, remarks to reporters : Biden pushed through a Senate resolution, passed unanimously, calling on the administration to invite NATO and U.N. troops into Iraq to share the burden of peacekeeping and reconstruction.The White House policy in Iraq is “just dead flat wrong,” Biden told reporters.“We need more forces ... and we have to make it clear that we’re not a force of occupation.” Biden pushed through a Senate resolution, passed unanimously, calling on the administration to invite NATO and U.N. troops into Iraq to share the burden of peacekeeping and reconstruction.The White House policy in Iraq is “just dead flat wrong,” Biden told reporters.“We need more forces ... and we have to make it clear that we’re not a force of occupation.”

July 20, NBC’s “Meet the Press”: Question: “Do you question your own vote to go to war against Saddam Hussein?” Biden: “No.I still believe my vote was just — but the president’s use of that authority was unwise in ways I never imagined.”

Not until November 2005 did Biden acknowledge that his vote was a mistake.And we went without a plan.”

When Bush in 2006 proposed a “surge” of troops in Iraq, Biden was a prominent dissenter to the strategy.And in 2008, Biden told CBS’s “60 Minutes” that Barack Obama, his running mate, had been right to oppose the war.“He not only got it right about being against the war, I got it wrong about underestimating the incompetence of this administration when we gave the president the power we gave him at the time,” Biden said.AD

We received a long statement from Blinken via the Biden campaign:

AD

“Vice President Biden misspoke by saying that he declared his opposition to the war immediately.The Bush Administration assured then-Senator Biden that the purpose of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force was to strengthen our position at the U.N. Security Council to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq, and that diplomacy would be exhausted without a premature rush to war.Once the war began, then-Senator Biden was immediately clear in his opposition to how we got into the conflict and the way it was being conducted — including the failure to exhaust diplomacy or enlist allies, the reliance on and hyping of faulty intelligence, and the absence of a viable plan to win the peace.He was adamant that, however misguided the war, we owed it to our troops to support them, and he fought for investments like MRAPs [Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles] that saved hundreds of lives from IEDs.”

The Pinocchio Test

A case could be made that Biden tried to slow down the rush for war and farsightedly highlighted problems with the administration’s diplomacy and execution of the conflict.But he went too far to portray himself as a war opponent “from the moment it started.”

Yes, Biden was critical of how the war was managed and the reasons it was waged, and thus he would be on more solid ground if he simply called himself a war critic.Biden was on his way to Four Pinocchios until his staff acknowledged that he misspoke.Update: Biden told New Hampshire voters that he made a “misrepresentation” when he said he opposed the war immediately.The committee chairmen demanded that the White House and State Department turn over by next Monday all documents and correspondence related to Manafort and Biden’s son Hunter Biden, whose past involvement with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma spurred Giuliani’s scrutiny of the former vice president.Kellie Nelson, a 48-year-old purchasing manager from Charlotte, says she donated to the Biden campaign thinking she was “going to get a sticker for my car or whatever.” Then, the next day, she answered her phone, and “I was like, ‘Holy Christ!It’s Joe Biden.’ ”

NEW CASTLE, N.H. — Joe Biden was not convincing Rebecca Beaulieu to trust him.After the 24-year-old activist asked Biden why he raised money with the founder of a natural gas company, the former vice president clarified that the donor did not run the company anymore.Biden then asked rhetorically whether Beaulieu would “disqualify” anyone in politics with an investment plan that included energy stocks.“You don't have to agree, but I want you to look into my eyes,” Biden said.“I guarantee you, we're going to end fossil fuels.”

It was at least the second time that Biden, whose climate plan does not ban fossil fuels, suggested that he envisioned such a ban.As Democrats prepare to debate in Houston on Thursday, all three of the candidates leading in polls — Biden and Sens.“We would make sure it’s eliminated, and no more subsidies for either one of those, period,” Biden said, referring to both oil and natural gas exploration.The dividing line between Joe Biden and his challengers,” by Michael Scherer

For a long time, Warren's relative weakness in her adopted state was a major argument for her political vulnerability.This is the best she has done in a poll of the March 3, 2020, primary -- a functional tie with Biden, whose recent campaigning in the state has been limited to a quick June visit and a September fundraiser.That’s good news for the current leader in that race, former vice president Joe Biden.While his policy positions aren’t exactly centrist, Biden has been overt in embracing a less-liberal agenda than his competition.There are a lot of factors that overlap in Biden’s support, so many that it’s hard to suss out the importance of his more-moderate policies.Biden’s position in the polls is also bolstered by the sense that he has the best chance of beating Trump in a general election, a sense that may derive in part from his taking less partisan positions on issues.She, like Biden, was supported more heavily by black Democrats in the primary, but black turnout in 2016 declined from 2012.Former vice president Joe Biden would get the vote of 25 percent of the black women surveyed, the most of the 16 candidates listed.She comes in behind Biden overall at 15 percent and behind Sanders with 17.1 percent among younger black women voters.The Massachusetts senator has replaced Bernie Sanders as the preferred punching bag of lower-polling moderate candidates who are hesitant to go after Biden.Tuesday night was different; at one point, Sen. Cory Booker rushed to Biden’s defense and blasted CNN’s moderators for asking Biden a question about his son’s business ties in Ukraine.And this is an especially critical moment for that transition, as Elizabeth Warren has overtaken Joe Biden as frontrunner, who appears to be fading.If Biden fades out, Buttigieg stands to take his place.But it might be enough to displace Biden.First, she described the Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria, which is controlled by America’s Kurdish allies, thusly: “the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war we’ve been waging in Syria.”

The US is not waging a war of regime change in Syria (as Biden pointed out later in the debate).When Buttigieg challenged her shaky analysis, saying that “the slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal,” she accused him of supporting “endless war.” His response was succinct and devastating: “You can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump’s policy, as you’re doing.”

— Zack Beauchamp

Joe Biden’s campaign is not going as planned.Tuesday night was Biden’s opportunity to stop the bleeding.First, Biden whiffed an answer that he should have been prepared for.Early on, moderator Anderson Cooper asked Biden about why it was okay for his son, Hunter, to be on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while Biden was vice president, influencing policy in Ukraine.Biden responded, “My son did nothing wrong.While there’s no evidence that Biden’s son did anything illegal, there’s still something a bit unsettling — even corrupt — about Biden’s son likely benefiting from his family name and maybe even his father’s policymaking.But Democrats are kidding themselves if they don’t think it helps explain why Trump’s corruption is tolerated.”

After this moment, you could be forgiven for forgetting that Biden was even on the stage.But Biden didn’t distinguish himself in any of these discussions.When a CNN reporter asked former vice president Joe Biden this summer whether people needed to worry that his administration would “come for my guns,” he did not hesitate.AD

“Bingo, you’re right, if you have an assault weapon,” said Biden, a centrist by the field’s standards.Participants in the filibuster included Joe Biden (D–DE), Chuck Schumer (D–NY), Robert Menendez (D–NJ), Hillary Clinton (D–NY), Barack Obama (D–IL), and Susan Collins (R–ME).As she spoke, Harris’s head bobbed for emphasis and her voice crescendoed and seemed to shake when she hit the line, “That child was me,” and turned to look Biden square in the eye.It accounts for Biden’s second-largest lead (15 points) over Trump since beginning his campaign.And Biden’s biggest lead (16 points) came just two weeks ago in a Quinnipiac University poll.The most popular Democrat, Biden (53 percent favorable vs. 37 percent unfavorable), has already suffered from stumbles on the campaign trail, and some Democrats worry about what that could mean if it continues.AD

AD

Biden, for instance, touts his early polls against Trump in his first ad in Iowa, but his first run for president imploded when he was shown to have plagiarized a British politician in his speeches.That’s to say nothing of how Biden or any other candidate will handle the frenzy of the general election, particularly when Trump — quite possibly with the help of the Kremlin and who knows who else — creates an atmosphere of chaos and madness in which all notions of objective truth become meaningless.He does worst against former vice president Joe Biden, but also runs well behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and slightly behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)… Of all the Democrats tested against Trump, Biden currently does the best, aided by significant support from women."She’s gone from 53% favorable to 75% among Democrats with just 11% unfavorable.” Biden, meanwhile, has taken a modest hit: “The former vice president, who leads in most national polls of the Democratic contest, is also well liked – 71%/22%.a Biden adviser told Bloomberg News: “While Warren has posted tax returns dating back to 2008 on her campaign website, the Biden camp appears to be calling for greater scrutiny of the years before 2008, the year she was appointed to the Congressional Oversight Panel that examined the government response to the financial crisis."https://t.co/XEBwzySxac — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) September 10, 2019

Of all the Democrats tested against Trump, Biden currently does the best, aided by significant support from women.At that time, only Biden was running ahead of Trump by double digits among registered voters, while the others were within two points of the president.In the Post-ABC survey, Biden enjoys a net positive favorable rating of 16 points (53 percent favorable, 37 percent unfavorable).Among women, the president is trailing by significant margins — by 30 points against Biden and by over 20 points against Sanders, Harris and Warren.Each Democratic challenger pulls at least 45 percent support among white women voters without college degrees and over half of them support Biden against Trump (54 percent).All five Democrats currently are attracting at least somewhat more support in the suburbs than Trump although only Biden has a substantial lead among suburban voters, at 18 points.AD

Among the 59 percent of registered voters who rate the economy as “excellent” or “good,” Trump has 63 percent support in a head-to-head matchup against Biden, who is favored by 34 percent of this group.Biden also receives 86 percent support among voters who rate the economy negatively.Faiz reports that presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden declined to take a position on AB5 after multiple inquiries from The Post.Well, I helped organize that affair, and I thought her attack was extremely hypocritical because nearly 20 of us who attended the Biden fundraiser had also given her $2,000 or more in 2018 at closed-door fundraisers in “swanky” locations.Sure, but I’m confident that the crowd at the Biden fundraiser gave money to him for the same reason I did.Supreme Court to hear Louisiana Abortion Case Trump’s China-Biden investigation proposal invites political blowback; Barr asked Facebook to delay encryption plan; Trump accused of infringing on states rights with environmental policy; Supreme Court agrees to hear Louisiana abortion case; Trade deficit widens to $54.9 billion: more than expected.Then-Vice President Joe Biden told a conference of African leaders in 2016 that corruption represents a “cancer” which “not only undermines but prevents the establishment of genuine democratic systems [and] stifles economic growth and scares away investment.” [1]

The debate and its aftermath marked a new phase for the campaign, as it heads into a crucial stretch this fall, with what has felt like a rollicking and unpredictable primary race beginning to stabilize.“Joe Biden went into the debate as the front-runner and Joe Biden came out of the debate as the front-runner,” said Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and a onetime party chairman who is neutral in the race.The numerous attacks on Biden have not landed, he said, because “we all know Joe.Joe Biden has been in this a very long time.People love Joe Biden.And honestly, people don’t want to see them attacking President Obama’s record.”

The other candidates also have attempted a delicate dance: praising President Barack Obama while trying to criticize Biden’s record within the administration.But so far Biden has easily dispatched those critiques by hugging closely the most popular figure in the party.Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has attempted to ridicule Biden for a crime bill that led to mass incarceration, while Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said he was weak on women’s rights.During Thursday’s debate, former Obama administration housing secretary Julián Castro made an aggressive attempt to highlight Biden’s mental acumen by repeatedly suggesting that he had forgotten something that he’d said just two minutes earlier.AD

“I think that we are at a tough point right now, because there’s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,” Booker said during a CNN interview after the debate, adding that Castro raised “really legitimate concerns.”

Senior advisers to former Vice President Joe Biden told ABC News that they have three objectives they hope to accomplish in tonight's debate: (1) Argue that action -- not just plans -- is needed, and that Biden has a proven record of getting things done; (2) defend the Obama administration's record, and argue that building on that legacy is the best course of action; (3) push back on the notion that Biden's ideas are merely incremental.The advisers were twice asked about how Biden would deal with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell specifically on guns, to which they said Biden would work with the other side in a bipartisan manner where he could.But if they prove uncooperative, Biden would take the fight directly to the American people and name check those in the GOP when he does, the advisers said.Biden's team downplayed the suggestion that his recent missteps on the trail were having an impact, and repeated their belief that voters know who he is, and that they will watch him on the trail and make their own determination on whether his age is an issue.“I think the biggest mistake we can make in the campaign would be to not let Joe Biden be Joe Biden.And here are some common themes

Despite the former president being the party's most popular member, the more liberal flanks and some lower-polling candidates forced Biden to fend off the attacks on his former boss, particularly on health care and immigration.On immigration, although the previous White House took steps to overhaul the immigration system -- even using executive powers to protect Dreamers -- several 2020 Democrats took aim at the three million deportations under the Obama presidency, leaving Biden as the sole navigator of those criticisms.Meg Kinnard/AP

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, too, challenged Biden over Obama-era immigration policies on that stage, without using Obama’s name.Biden responded by calling out his fellow Democrats for unleashing friendly fire against Obama instead of railing against Trump."To compare him to Donald Trump, I think is absolutely bizarre," Biden said at one point during the July debate.South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg echoed Biden’s sentiment to reporters in Las Vegas days after the debate, saying, "[I’m] a little puzzled that when we're all running against President Trump, some folks felt the need to run against President Obama."For some in the field hoping to pick up voters that might stray from the 76-year old Biden, that middle ground oftentimes reflects a message of "generational change," "unity" and rising above the divisiveness.Biden argued at a campaign stop in Laconia, New Hampshire on Friday that sharing the stage "will be a good thing" because he says, "I’ve never had to break through."While all eyes seem to be on the moderate vs. progressive showdown between the two, an advisor for Biden suggested that he will be ready to take on Warren’s "I have a plan for that" mantra -- saying Biden’s plans were anything but middle of the road."I expect you’ll see Biden echo an important point he made during last week's climate forum: We need more than plans, we need a president who can deliver progress on the most pressing issues facing Americans, which Joe Biden has proven he can throughout his career," the official told ABC News.AD

We knew that would come from Biden, who launched a campaign ad shortly before the debate hailing his achievements with Obama.Well I’m for Barack,” Biden said near the start.… Now the question is: How best can we improve on it?” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said of her more middle-ground approach on health care: “I want to do what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, which is a public option.” Julián Castro even invoked Obama to attack Biden, when he said Biden’s health-care proposal would leave 10 million people uninsured.Losers

Castro’s big attack on Biden: The former housing secretary clearly came ready to go at this debate, and he went hard at Biden.He accused Biden of saying his plan would not automatically enroll people in his public-health-care option.When Biden denied it, Castro was apoplectic.“Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?” he said repeatedly, perhaps in a not-so-subtle jab at Biden’s age.Joe Biden.You could feel the stillness of the room as Biden shared the tragic loss of his wife and daughter and later a son to cancer.Biden’s answers became increasingly complex and convoluted, and he took a long break from the fray as the questioning turned to foreign policy.Biden likely found few converts, but his backers found little reason to doubt their man.Democrats looking for a steady, more centrist hand also have their person, and Biden thus far hasn’t given them reason to change.Biden owns that lane right now, and if he stays strong, Klobuchar goes home early.Biden surely would have to pick a woman to unite a party where nearly 60 percent of the voters are female.A Biden-Klobuchar ticket would be focused on the Trump Democrat whose party switch broke the Blue Wall while also reassuring Romney-to-Clinton voters that Democratic radicals would be kept on a leash.“Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas, the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there.”

The two senators stood their ground, arguing that overall families would save money on health care, but Biden pressed his case that neither has fully explained how they would finance a public-run health-care system and insisted that everyone would face a hike in their income taxes.AD

What has been consistent throughout this contest is Biden’s standing atop the polls.Biden has enjoyed the top spot in virtually every national measure of the campaign, seen as the most electable by a considerable margin and displaying the broadest support within the party of any of the candidates.Pressed by one of the moderators, Jorge Ramos, to declare whether he had made a mistake in supporting the deportation policies carried out during the presidency of Barack Obama, Biden paused, seemingly uncomfortably, and then said, “I’m the vice president of the United States.”

That drew a rebuke from Julián Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and housing secretary in the Obama administration.He challenged Biden, claiming the former vice president seemed happy to take credit for good things under Obama but walked away from the bad things.Biden quickly tried to clean things up.Biden said he had been mistaken to believe then-President George W.

The Democrats’ sharp disagreements were clearest in the exchanges between former vice president Joe Biden and Sens.Biden articulated one vision, of letting people of all ages – not just seniors – enroll in Medicare but still keeping the system of employer-sponsored coverage in place.Biden was raring to attack Medicare-for-all’s cost.“Maybe you've run into people who love their premiums, I haven't,” Sanders said to Biden.“I know that the senator says she’s for Bernie,” Biden said at the debate’s outset, referring to Warren.Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said she favors offering people a public option, saying it’s “what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning.”

And Julian Castro, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Obama, invoked the former president’s name to attack Biden.Biden was asked to defend the lack of action on gun violence prevention following the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting in 2012 under the Obama administration."I'm the only one up here who's ever beat the NRA," Biden said, citing his work to pass the Brady Bill – which imposes a waiting period for buying handguns -- that went into effect in 1994 while he was senator.SUGAR RUSH

On Castro’s turn, he immediately sought to draw a contrast with Biden, who is the leader in the polls.Castro cast Biden’s plan as one that would make people opt in to Medicare, accusing Biden of falling short of Barack Obama’s ultimate goal of having every American insured.But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in .My plan would do that, your plan would not.”

Biden: (trying to talk over Castro) “I said if they can’t afford it … If you qualify for Medicaid, you’d automatically be …”

Castro: “You said they would have to buy in.Biden: “I said anyone — your grandmother who has no money — she would, you’re automatically enrolled.”

Castro: “We need a health-care system that automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not.You get covered, period.”

But what Castro doesn’t mention is Biden also said this: “Okay, number one, my health-care plan does significantly cut the costs of — the largest out-of-pocket payment you’ll pay is $1,000.Castro was calling Biden old, plain and simple, by accusing him of forgetting what he said.Whispers about Biden’s age have followed him on the campaign trail.But Biden was most recently on the national stage three years ago, and some people think he’s, well, aged since then.Plus, Biden’s bumper-sticker line to voters is that he is the most experienced, most knowledgeable and most skilled candidate to take on Trump.Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) repeatedly told Biden to “pass the torch” during the first debate.And Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) said last week he thinks Biden is “declining.”

But Swalwell dropped out and Ryan didn’t make the debate stage.It’s about the health-care policy.” But look at the exchange, and you’ll see Castro accused Biden of forgetting not once but several times.It looks as though Biden’s age is now fair game for some of his top opponents.But Biden didn’t actually forget anything.Biden explained earlier that his plan does allow people to choose Medicare (“Medicare by choice,” he called it), but that people who qualify for it financially will automatically be enrolled in it.As Biden said, these people “do not have to buy in.” Castro might take issue with the fact some people do have to buy in.(Biden said earlier that if you lose your job and need new insurance, you could buy in to this.)But he was incorrect that Biden forgot something about his own plan.It was Castro who forgot what Biden said.Biden plans to build on Obamacare, which set up a market for private insurance and encouraged states to expand Medicaid, to create a government-run public option as well.Castro’s issue was that Biden’s plan does not create universal coverage; he singled out that an estimated 10 million Americans would still be uninsured under Biden’s plan.A risky move for Castro just became riskier: He called out Biden in a way that could be considered below-the-belt.THE TICKER

Former Vice President Joe Biden — who in the last debate disavowed the Trans Pacific Partnership he helped forge — didn’t enter the fray on the trade debate.The proposal appeared to be targeted directly at older voters who have been gravitating toward former Vice President Joseph R.

has proposed a mandatory buyback program, among other measures, and was also the first candidate to endorse the March for Our Lives gun-control program, “A Peace Plan for a Safer America.” Vice President Joe Biden defended his previous assertion that it's unconstitutional to eliminate assault weapons.Castro attacks Biden's memory: He went there.The question of whether Joe Biden has lost a step is whispered loudly and not so loudly by rivals.Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro confronted it head on when he questioned Biden’s memory during an exchange on health care.A number of Democrats said the attack was out of bounds: Former White House chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel said “it was a disqualifier how he handled it.” Fellow presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar said it was akin to “something like Donald Trump would tweet.” And former White House senior adviser David Axelrod said “it was personal to the point of being off putting.”

Castro did receive get support from Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), who said Castro had some “legitimate concerns” and “there’s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling.” Not personal: After the debate, Castro played down any notion he was talking about anything bigger than health care.And it’s worth noting that Sanders is 78 years old and former vice president Joe Biden is 76, but there is rarely the suggestion that Sanders is too old.Former vice president Joe Biden: Every day, in front of every audience, Biden faces a threshold question: Does he appear to be too old for the presidency?Biden is the front-runner, but he is not dominant.He tried to take a cheap shot at Biden on being old and forgetful, but it did not land.Biden had his strongest performance in the debates so far, showing moments of spark and fluency, and generally avoiding the gaffes and awkward pauses that hurt him in the June debate in Miami, although he got a bit lost Thursday in a response to a question about Afghanistan.Why don’t you?”

Biden came in for a variety of gibes, as one would expect for the front-runner, but only former HUD secretary Julián Castro launched attacks with gusto, and even a touch of meanness.When Biden denied that his health-care plan required poor people to buy in, Castro argued that Biden was contradicting himself, and seemed to reference the former vice president’s age by asking, “Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?” The crowd booed.AD

● Joe Biden: “We're in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail.Dipping into the Post-ABC poll, we can overlay a potential 2020 contest - Trump vs. former Vice President Joe Biden - with views of an assault weapons ban and a mandatory buyback program.While Biden leads Trump among all Americans by a 54-38 margin, he leads Trump 73-18 among those who support an O'Rourke-style buyback.Note that there are slightly more people who back Biden but oppose a buyback than there are people who back Trump but support it.In other words, while 18% of those who support a buyback would choose Trump over Biden, 31% of those who oppose a buyback would choose Biden over Trump.Perhaps some of that 31% are more moderate voters who would flip from Biden to Trump over the assault weapons ban.Former vice president Joe Biden’s opposition to federally mandated busing of children in the 1970s has drawn scorn from some rivals, and the debate has spurred conversation over how to mitigate the segregation that remains in schools.Now critics and even the media are debating the fairness of pointing out Biden’s age — and the challenges that may present.(Castro, after the debate, said he was “fact checking” Biden.He also said Friday that his questioning Biden’s memory had nothing to do with the former vice president’s age.)The Fix’s Aaron Blake wrote last month about Biden’s recent, frequent flubs on the campaign trail and why they matter to his candidacy.That context was the backdrop for when, in a back-and-forth over health care, Castro accused Biden of not remembering what he had said moments before.That Castro was incorrect about what Biden had said didn’t help his argument, and it probably further muddles the debate over whether a candidate’s age is fair game.https://t.co/N1WCd9yLtm — Richard W.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who has been willing to attack Biden on his record plenty, though not on this issue, was the only other candidate who backed up Castro.“I think we are at a tough point because there are a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball across the finished line without fumbling,” he said on CNN after the debate.When Castro was asked in follow-up interviews about bringing up a question that implicated Biden’s age, he tried to say he did not.“Number one, he couldn’t hear me in the auditorium,” Castro said of Biden.“It didn’t matter that it was Joe Biden.A lot of people consider Biden’s mental sharpness — and his argument that he is the best candidate for the job — fair game.AD

At the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention in August, Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), who is also running for president but was not in Thursday night’s debate, appeared to allude to Biden’s sharpness.“I’m just saying that it’s unclear sometimes ― when [Biden] is articulating positions, there’s a lack of clarity.And I’ll leave it at that.”

But plenty of people on Twitter also questioned whether attacking Biden the way Castro clearly did — alluding to his age — was fair game.If Biden can’t remember what he said a few minutes before he doesn’t belong on a presidential debate stage.AD

“Similarly, if Biden (or any other candidate) had used Castro’s ‘two minutes ago’ line on Trump, every Democrat in America would be calling it a strong line,” she tweeted.Preston Mitchum, who teaches health law and policy at Georgetown University Law Center, told The Fix that Castro’s response to Biden in a conversation about health-care policy appeared to be about silencing valid criticism.Now we get lunch.MORE

SPECTER: And it is now Senator BidenÂs turn for his second round, for 20 minutes.Senator Biden?SPECTER: Thanks very much, Senator Biden.We now have both Senator Durbin and Senator Coburn present.Senator Durbin, youÂve asked for two minutes as a matter of personal privilege.I think it would be fine.And this has to do with this last matter that Senator Biden was also discussing, and thatÂs the Princeton alumni group, just to make sure that the key facts are understood here.You believe you joined, Judge Alito, around 1985 because of a concerned threat to ROTC at Princeton university.But you did not try to dodge or duck those questions at all.In fact, let me just read for the record two or three statements relating to your performance here at this hearing, if I could, please.Well, Senator Biden isnÂt here, so I wonÂt read what he has said but itÂs on the chart.I know Senator Sessions confessed a mistake, and as it turned out I went over and talked to Senator Biden, because I quoted him, and it turned out I didnÂt quite quote him accurately.And IÂd like the specification.Senator Biden is prepared to proceed, has requested 20 minutes, and is prepared to proceed.We now have Senator Biden, whoÂs requested 20 minutes, and Senator Feinstein 10 and Senator Durbin 10 -- all of which will be done tomorrow.Anybody who wants a fourth round, I want to do the third rounds tonight so that we can move ahead promptly tomorrow.They say they just donÂt like them.But you have been consistent and very patient in stating your position, even though you have been called upon to state it repetitively and repetitively and repetitively.So I think it is well within the gambit of fairness to say that you have been patient and youÂve shown real stamina, as has Mrs. Alito and has your loyal family.So we will proceed at 9:00 tomorrow, and we will have 20 minutes for Senator Biden, 10 minutes for Senator Feinstein, 10 minutes for Senator Durbin.Julián Castro and Cory Booker went there on Joe Biden on Thursday night.Neither of them said it — that Biden is too old — but they might as well have.Castro at one point (wrongly) accused Biden of forgetting something he had just said on the debate stage, animatedly repeating, “Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?”

Then Booker appeared on CNN after the debate and had this to say:

BOOKER: I think that we are at a tough point right now, because there’s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling.… Q: Do you think that Biden did a better job tonight?… But there are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.BOOKER: No, I’m definitely not saying that, because I’ve listened to Joe Biden over the years and often felt like there were times that he is going on or meandering in his speech.If I believed Joe Biden was that person, I wouldn’t be sitting here.Sen. Cory Booker on Julián Castro’s jab at former VP Joe Biden’s memory: “Castro has some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line?And he has every right to call that out.” #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rRxWIV0FmL — CNN (@CNN) September 13, 2019

We can debate all day whether these are veiled or not-so-veiled attacks on Biden’s age (Castro claimed after the debate he was just engaging on policy).Doing so certainly highlights Biden’s age, which is an unavoidable topic given he would by far be our oldest president and certainly has had his share of flubs and senior moments.But were Biden to become the Democratic nominee, this is the kind of primary attack that could be difficult to shake.It’s easier to dismiss “crazy” and “dangerous” as overheated campaign rhetoric; what about the argument that Biden just isn’t sharp?They’ll argue it’s unfair to focus on Biden’s flubs when Trump has so many of his own.But the more they suggest Biden may not be a steady leader capable of “carrying the ball across the line” in the campaign, the more difficult it will be to draw that contrast with Trump.She quoted Biden in 1975 saying that he didn’t “feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.”

AD

“You said that some 40 years ago,” Davis continued.To which Biden offered a complex and wildly indirect response.I went back and watched it several times to figure out what Biden was trying to say and the path he took to get there.Biden fumbled for a moment at the outset.After the first Democratic debate, Biden made a similar, more direct assertion to this point.“I did support federal action to address root causes of segregation in our schools and our communities,” he said at an event in July, “including taking on the banks and redlining and trying to change the way in which neighborhoods were segregated.”

AD

In the middle of his similar answer Thursday night, though, Biden reset again.Give every single teacher a raise, the equal raise to getting out — the $60,000 level.”

This is part of Biden’s education platform, something he’s talked about regularly.That plan also includes a push to double the number of support staff in schools, which Biden talked about next.Perhaps without realizing it, Biden was walking back into rough terrain.First, Biden reset again, only slightly, mentioning that he had firsthand experience with what teachers experience.My deceased wife is a teacher,” Biden continued.“We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children,” Biden said.But Biden’s answer here has him suggesting that the way to address a divide that he called institutional is to get black parents to do a better job.Perhaps that's what Biden was doing here, looking for a safe port.AD

AD

Perhaps it was more troublesome: Biden subconsciously deciding that talking about improving parenting skills was a good answer to a question about “repairing the legacy of slavery in our country” — that there was a central link between black parenting and the inequalities of our educational system.There was a public debate early in Barack Obama’s second term in office (and Biden’s second as vice president) in which Obama criticized black culture as a barrier to success.If Biden internalized that argument without recognizing why he might not be the best messenger for it, that’s a problem.This would be the second time that Biden problematically conflated poverty and race in the context of education.At an event in Iowa last month, Biden said that students needed to be challenged.AD

AD

Biden had been criticized for actually stopping when his time was up, which was seen as an admission that he didn't want to say too much.“No,” Biden said to Davis, rather indignantly.The deal is that we've got this a little backward,” Biden said.I’ve confronted Maduro,” Biden said.Biden hadn’t been asked a direct question in the debate during segments about Latin America and climate change.Perhaps this was Biden’s way of again resetting, again finding familiar terrain.Davis broke his line of thinking on education (probably to Biden’s benefit), and he then remembered that he’d wanted to make two points: that others ran over the time limit and that he had thoughts about Latin America.Trump's move has helped unite Democrats and Republicans against him at a moment when he needs conservatives in Congress to fend off a fast-moving impeachment inquiry looking into the president's efforts to push Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his top political rivals.AD

Julián Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of housing and urban development in the Obama administration, got criticized in the moment — one attendee said there were gasps in the audience — for seeming to raise the age issue in a loud attack on Biden.But on Friday, the post-debate focus was all about Biden’s age.Biden went in as the leader in the polls and with question marks surrounding his candidacy.AD

Thursday was the first time this year that Biden and Warren shared a debate stage, and there was considerable anticipation about what might happen.He and Biden had their differences, on health care and on the Iraq War in particular, but those differences were known — and aired out — already.Biden’s explanation of his Iraq War authorization vote while in the Senate remains squishy, and his entire answer about Afghanistan and Iraq was, putting it gently, hard to follow.In the most recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, there was a clear gap between Biden and Warren and Sanders.AD

The one candidate whose strategy — if it was that — appeared to backfire was Castro, when he almost yelled at Biden, “Are you forgetting what you just said?” That certainly sounded like code designed to raise the issue of Biden’s age and acuity.Biden said Friday the age issue is fair game.AD

If the Democratic race is all about electability, then Biden is in the driver’s seat.AD

Biden looks much less strong when a different question is asked: Who would be the best president for the country, regardless of which candidate has the best chance of defeating Trump?Among Biden’s supporters, 81 percent have a strong favorable impression of him and 70 percent also say he would be the best president, but that leaves 30 percent who cite another candidate or cite no one.About 1,500 miles away in Houston, former vice president Joe Biden faced accusations of having a faulty memory during an intense Democratic presidential debate that exposed deep ideological divisions and included a few personal swipes.AD

“Nobody’s yet said how much it’s going to cost the taxpayer,” Biden said after a lengthy discussion of the Medicare-for-all idea backed by Sens.Julián Castro jumped in and inaccurately accused Biden of changing his position within minutes, alluding to questions about the 76-year-old’s age and mental acuity.“This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,” South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said after Castro claimed that he was the rightful bearer of Barack Obama’s legacy, rather than Biden.A Biden campaign makes it harder to engage the party’s leftward flank.Biden, who served as Obama’s vice president for eight years, has hewed most closely to the record and policies of the former president.“I stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent,” Biden said at the debate when challenged over the Obama administration’s record on deportations.Racism hasn't been relegated to history, Biden says on anniversary of 1963 church bombing

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Speaking on the anniversary of a 1963 bombing that killed four black girls and galvanized the civil rights movement, former vice president Joe Biden said that the hatred on display that day is not dead - and that Americans are still grappling with white supremacy, which "has been the antagonist of our highest ideals from before our founding,"

"Lynch mobs - arsonists - bomb makers and lone gunmen.And as we all now realize, this violence does not live in the past," Biden said to a mostly black crowd in a sanctuary lighted by a stained-glass image of black Jesus.Biden did not mention President Donald Trump and alluded only obliquely to his own White House aspirations, but his remarks at the 16th Street Baptist Church underscore the prominent and often volatile role that race has played in this presidential campaign.Biden, who said he was motivated to enter the 2020 race after seeing the rally of Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, has positioned himself as a candidate who would help heal a divided nation that has never fully overcome its racist past.Biden told the crowd that the bombing also motivated him to leave a white-shoe law firm and become a public defender - and, ultimately, to pursue public service.Throughout the 2020 campaign, Biden has argued that he has been working on behalf of civil rights for decades, even as he has faced questions about past views opposing forced busing.Biden and Booker have clashed over Biden's statements about his fine working relationship with segregationist senators during his first years serving in Congress."I want you to know that I very much appreciate your help during this week's Committee meeting in attempting to bring my antibusing legislation to a vote," Biden wrote on June 30, 1977, to Sen. James Eastland, who had vowed to stop whites and blacks from eating together in Washington and had once called African Americans "an inferior race."Biden's earlier statements have resurfaced and sparked new criticism, including in the most recent debate.Biden and his supporters have argued that the criticism levied against him are attempts by his opponents to gain momentum by rehashing the past and that he has been a stalwart defender of civil rights.The criticism has not pulled black voters away from Biden.In South Carolina, a state where nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters are black, Biden has a commanding 43 percent of the vote, according to an early-September CBS News poll.Biden said at a fundraiser in Houston last week that he's also popular in Alabama, a state with a large African American population."Now hate is on the rise again, and we're at a defining moment again in American history," Biden said.READING LIST

Former vice president Joe Biden released a statement calling for further investigation.Former vice president Joe Biden, who leads in the polls, has so far hewed to smaller-scale appearances.Some of the hopefuls talked up their strengths, but Biden played up his long-standing ties with South Carolina, showing why 43 percent of Palmetto State respondents supported him in a recent CBS poll.The late senator Fritz Hollings, a popular South Carolina Democrat, “brung me to the dance,” Biden recounted.When Biden’s first wife and daughter were killed in a 1972 car crash shortly after his election to the Senate, he told the crowd, he considered resigning before he was even sworn in.It was Hollings who persuaded Biden to come to Washington, saying his wife had “worked like the devil to get you here.”

On Sunday, Biden spoke at the 56th anniversary of the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., which killed four black girls and galvanized the civil rights movement.The former vice-president’s lead in the polls has proven durable, but some fear a replay of 2016

A small cheer went up as Joe Biden walked into the Detroit One Coney Island Restaurant, took off his sunglasses and beamed.“This is a marathon,” an upbeat Biden said.After it was over, no one claimed that Biden had destroyed his foes or offered Obama-like inspiration; the late-night TV comedian Stephen Colbert observed, “Democrats have gone from ‘Yes, we can!’ to ‘That’ll do’.”

But Biden had survived.Yet, instead of collapsing, Biden retains a healthy lead in the opinion polls before next year’s caucuses and primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states that will determine which Democrat goes head to head with Donald Trump in November 2020.Two people whom Biden encountered at his campaign stop in Detroit on Thursday illustrated why, in his third bid for the White House, he is still the man to beat – but also the many pitfalls that lie ahead.He’s done enough to merit the kind of support that he’s getting.”

However, after Biden had embraced Anthony and climbed into his black limousine following the event, a woman rushed towards it shouting at him through the tinted window: “Three million deportations!Where is your apology?”

The incident highlighted how, by tethering himself to Obama as he promises to heal the nation’s soul, Biden has brought the 44th president’s own record under fresh scrutiny, as was evident at the debates.Attitudes in the Democratic party have shifted since then – and threaten to leave Biden behind.The anti-Biden protester was Brenda Valladares, 29, of Movimiento Cosecha, an immigrant-led movement campaigning for protection and respect.There’s still no apology for the atrocities that the undocumented communities experienced for eight years and that built and lay the groundwork for the atrocities and the hate that we’re experiencing today.”

John Zogby, an author and pollster, said: “I always thought Biden is the one to go after Trump.Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant and pollster, said: “Biden is still clearly overwhelmingly the frontrunner but he is a frontrunner with some serious challenges ahead of him.He has to do at least mediocre in every debate between now and February.”

At 76, Biden would surpass Trump as the oldest person ever elected US president and would be yet another white man chosen from a historically diverse field that includes women, people of color and a 37-year-old mayor who is gay.Both are capable of firing up young supporters in a way that Biden might envy.The Green New Deal and the guaranteed living wage: that’s not Bill Clinton’s Democratic party and it’s not Barack Obama’s Democratic party.”

Many on the left fear that Biden v Trump would be a replay of 2016’s Clinton v Trump with a similar enthusiasm gap.They suggest that Biden’s candidacy is in a slow but inexorable decline.Neil Sroka, spokesman for the progressive group Democracy for America, who is based in Detroit and attended night one of the debate, said: “Joe Biden’s best day in the race was the very first one.Sometimes it gives the impression that it has stopped leaking altogether.”

Sroka, who worked on Obama’s first campaign in South Carolina, suggested that Biden could not take African American voters for granted.I think it’s very likely Biden wins black voters right until the caucuses actually start happening.Former vice president Joe Biden:

Biden was one of the first Democrats to offer his own health-care proposal, which would let anyone choose to buy a government-backed plan such as Medicare.Feldman helped the Obama-Biden administration weather one of its toughest moments — the 2013 botched rollout of Healthcare.gov — as one of the White House staffers who helped triage resulting problems.Sarah Bianchi, a veteran policy staffer who worked in the Clinton and Obama White Houses and directed policy for the Kerry-Edwards presidential campaign, is also cited as a top influencer on Biden’s policies.She served as head of economic and domestic policy for Biden when he was vice president, and chairs the advisory board for the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware.Former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro cited similar reasons: “And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.”

Other candidates were more circumspect:

Vice President Joe Biden — whose treatment of Anita Hill during Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's Senate confirmation hearings in 1991 is seen by many on the left as a blemish on his resume — did not call for Kavanaugh's impeachment but rather further investigation into “the truthfulness of [Kavanaugh's] testimony to Senate,” per a statement obtained by CBS News's Jason Silverstein.In the 2020 cycle, the media blind spot concerns former vice president Joe Biden.No matter how many gaffes Biden survives with no appreciable change in his poll standing, the media breathlessly explains there’s real concern he won’t survive.AD

This doesn’t mean Biden’s gaffes won’t slowly erode his appeal or that the media should ignore these comments, but they should not substitute their own evaluation for those who are voting for him, particularly older African American voters.The next time media outlets swarm after a rambling monologue by Biden, they should speak to voters to whom he appeals before warning of an impending collapse.Thrilling to her policy productivity, they don’t hunt for flaws in the way they do Biden gaffes.In head-to-head matchups with Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, combined Post-ABC polls in September and early July found Trump trailing 71 percent to 26 percent, which is similar to his losing margin among Hispanics in his 2016 race against Hillary Clinton, according to exit polling.But as Biden leans into his argument that he is the left’s best option to defeat Trumpism, some of his critics claim that he has a history of perpetuating stereotypical ideas of and anecdotes about black people that bring into question his understanding of the black American experience and ability to address issues of chief concern to many of them.One such anecdote went viral Sunday: an account Biden gave in 2017 of an incident when he was a lifeguard in 1962 involving a local gang leader who went by the name “Corn Pop.”

AD

AD

In a clip of the account and in his 2007 memoir, Biden describes a confrontation he had with a razor-blade-wielding Corn Pop that ended when Biden apologized for calling him by a different name.He was named in a story The Washington Post’s Robert Samuels wrote in July about Biden’s summer as a lifeguard at a pool in Wilmington, Del., that was predominantly frequented by African Americans.But re-airing the story was enough to give some Biden critics pause, especially coming on the heels of Thursday’s debate and Biden’s meandering answer to a question about slavery.AD

In response to this question from debate moderator Linsey Davis of ABC: “As you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?”

AD

Biden launched into a response that touched on and conflated many topics and included the following: “We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children,” he said.A kid coming from a very poor school — a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.”

Malaika Jabali, an attorney and writer, attempted to explain why many of Biden’s black critics find that story troublesome.“Folks really aren’t understanding what’s wrong with Joe Biden,” she tweeted.It’s about framing black people in the most reductive, outdated tropes possible.”

AD

Biden’s answer on slavery in the debate earned critiques as both an insufficient solution to inequality and for portraying black parents as neglectful and not deeply invested in their children’s education.AD

Mical Raz, a professor in public policy and health at the University of Rochester, wrote that Biden’s prescription for improving the word gap between low-income kids of color and affluent white kids is based in stereotypes and poor, outdated research.“While his dated choice of technology made many chuckle or cringe, Biden’s prescription for poor children reflected a long tradition of highlighting deficits, verbal and otherwise, in poor and minority families while ignoring the true causes of poverty and inequality,” she wrote for The Post.AD

Those looking to find other examples have decades of fodder from Biden’s career.During his 2008 presidential bid, Biden discussed the disproportionately high rates of AIDS in the black community at a forum with other candidates and got some pushback over this comment:

AD

“I spent last summer going through the black sections of my town holding rallies in parks trying to get black men to understand it’s not unmanly to wear a condom,” he said in 2007.There’s no shame in being tested for AIDS.”

Biden and his supporters frequently argue that the things he has said that attracted backlash from those on the left have been misunderstood and misrepresented.And Biden argues that having a track record as long as his will inevitably mean controversies can surface.AD

Biden argues that his presidency would be far superior on addressing the country’s racism than Trump’s or even the potential administrations of his liberal competitors, and many Democrats and black voters seem to agree with that, which accounts for his steady lead in the Democratic field.But for a vocal number of black voters on the left, Biden’s past and recent comments leave them worried that they’ll be stuck with a well-intentioned leader whose views on and words about black Americans have done more to harm than he seems to realize.So it’s perhaps not surprising that Biden faced scrutiny Sunday after a writer for the Root resurfaced a 2017 video of Biden recounting an altercation that involved him — then a 19-year-old lifeguard working at a swimming pool in a black neighborhood in Delaware — and a gang leader who shared a nickname with a breakfast cereal.Biden came to the confrontation with a chain; Corn Pop, a razor.But there was an indeed a man named Corn Pop, and his back-and-forths with Biden have long been part of the folklore of Wilmington’s east side.AD

AD

More than a dozen residents who grew up in Wilmington, including some who worked and swam at the pool, told The Washington Post for a previous story of the contentious relationship between Biden and William Morris, better known as Corn Pop.And I remember him talking about Joe Biden.”

Here’s the story the former vice president tells: While working as a lifeguard at Prices Run swimming pool, he blew his whistle at Corn Pop, who was playing around on the diving boards.Biden tried emasculating him by calling him “Esther Williams,” a movie actress and swimming champion known for performing musical numbers in and around water.AD

AD

Embarrassed, Corn Pop and his group, the Romans, threatened to jump Biden after closing time.The Romans, Biden says, were known to fight with razors.On the advice of a pool mechanic, Biden took a metal chain to the potential brawl.But instead of fighting, Biden says, the two reconciled.“I owe you an apology,” Biden told Corn Pop, as he recalled in his 2007 autobiography, “Promises to Keep.” “I should have never called you Esther Williams.But if you bounce on the board like that again, I’m still going to throw you out.”

Frustrated by the viral criticism over the weekend, Biden’s campaign asserted that there was little reason beyond Twitter chatter to cast doubt on the story’s veracity.AD

“Every fact about this that has been independently corroborated — which is the overwhelming majority of them — backs up Joe Biden’s account, and others in Delaware have discussed this altercation on the record for years,” said Andrew Bates, campaign spokesman.“What’s more, his telling of it has been consistent and true.”

AD

Biden has often said that his time at the pool was foundational in his understanding of conflict resolution and helped shape his relationship with the black community in Delaware.When Biden began working at Prices Run swimming pool in 1962, the neighborhood was in the midst of a demographic shift.“He could punch you so fast you didn’t even realize it.”

Biden, at times, has stated he was the only white lifeguard at the pool — but his contemporaries remember other whites working there.Nonetheless, Biden was mocked when he started working at the pool.AD

Biden was pranked and mocked because he was quick to use his whistle, neighborhood residents recalled in interviews.But there was a special tension between him and Corn Pop, said Maurice Pritchett, a school principal who was on the lifeguard shift with Biden.In one story, Corn Pop mouthed off at Biden to distract him while Corn Pop’s friends hopped over the pool’s fence to get in without paying.In another, Corn Pop and Biden started trading insults, and Biden was nervous that things would escalate.Richard “Mouse” Smith, a close friend of Biden’s and former head of the state NAACP, recalled telling Biden he had little to fear, that Corn Pop was mostly talk.But after Biden’s apology, the old-timers in Wilmington recalled Biden developing a special relationship with Corn Pop, the Romans and others he met at the pool.The neighborhood gangs treated him like an outsider, Baker said, but did not seem to have any problem with Biden, even though he’s white.“I don’t know if they even knew he was a lawyer.”

Biden’s remarks came on the same day that a standoff between the United Auto Workers and General Motors escalated, with GM shifting health-care costs onto striking workers.“Under Medicare-for-all, whether you’re working, whether you’re not working, whether you go from one job to another job, it’s right there with you.”

Sara Nelson, the influential president of the Association of Flight Attendants, an AFL-CIO union, appeared to warn Biden over his comments on Twitter.Biden seized on her comment in last Thursday’s debate.Concluding his remarks at the end of a question-and-answer session Tuesday, Biden argued that it’s not necessary to remove existing laws to make progress, emphasizing one of the core themes of his campaign.That’s not necessary,” Biden said.In addition to Biden and Sanders, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and billionaire activist Tom Steyer also fielded questions here.Biden talked about growing up in a working class community in which many of the people around him went on to become union workers.Joe did.”

In his remarks, Biden sought to cast his long career in government and politics — something critics seeking younger leadership have pounced on — into a positive.Baker, who came from a long line of Republicans, was at the Ferry Stump to support former vice president Joe Biden.I’m a Democrat, but I’m mainly a Democrat because Trump is the leader of the Republican Party.”

This newsletter doesn’t often get into national polling; there’s no national primary, and most of these candidates are unlikely to make it through the first month of voting.President Barack Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency produced a detailed report in 2016 that described what can go wrong with fracking and what measures (spill prevention, wastewater treatment) can control the risks, contrary to Sanders’s sweeping claim that “no amount of regulation can make it safe.”

AD

“Continue, but regulate” is basically the fracking position that former vice president Joe Biden has staked out, along with other more moderate Democratic candidates such as Sens.And that’s because former vice president Joe Biden is chugging along with 32 percent of voters and 34 percent of early primary state voters.It does, however, point to some important questions about the shape of the race going forward:

— If Warren passes Sanders, will progressives drop him and rally to her so the left has a chance against Biden?Once more we see that flashy debate performances (e.g., Beto O’Rourke) and direct attacks on Biden (Julián Castro) do nothing to change the trajectory of the race.Mitchell, who also introduced Warren at her rally last night, said the early endorsement was meant to give her a boost to surpass Biden, whom he denounced as beholden to corporate interests: “Warren's steady rise is an example of a really disciplined operation that she's built around her, and the fact that she's running her campaign in a way where she is putting real meaningful policy substance ahead that speaks to the fundamental structures of our economy and democracy.”

“Warren's steady rise is an example of a really disciplined operation that she's built around her, and the fact that she's running her campaign in a way where she is putting real meaningful policy substance ahead that speaks to the fundamental structures of our economy and democracy.” Mitchell argued that she has broad appeal with Democrats, beyond the left flank: “She is able to articulate that in common sense ways.Mitchell, who slammed Biden as a centrist and product of “corporate politics,” described Biden's performance on the debate stage last week as a crystallizing contrast to Warren: “What I heard was marginal solutions.Biden also drew criticism recently from a labor union in his own backyard: “ He always calls himself a Pennsylvanian at heart.The biggest name not included in the Weather Channel special is Joe Biden.The former vice president won't participate because of scheduling issues with the network, according to a Biden campaign official.Biden did appear at the CNN town hall on climate change last month, where he was pointedly questioned by an activist about a fundraiser co-hosted by a businessman who helped start a natural gas company.It has been a strategic move for Biden, who has made his campaign all about a binary choice between Trumpism and a return to the relative normalcy of the Obama years.Even as Biden says his campaign is not a “continuation” of the Obama administration, he has invoked Obama and his record more than any candidate during the first three debates.AD

AD

Biden has good reason to do this: Obama remains incredibly popular, especially among Democrats.Only 2 percent of Democrats rated Obama’s presidency as “poor,” according to a May 2019 CBS News/YouGov poll

44 percent of Americans said Obama was the best president of their lifetime, according to a June 2018 Pew Research Center survey

Biden has tied himself to Obama in at least three campaign ads in 2019, a stark difference from when former vice presidents George H.W.When Democratic candidates have criticized Obama, and by extension Biden, they haven’t reaped any rewards.Biden’s national polling lead has remained steady, according to the RealClearPolitics average, while no candidate who criticized Obama during the first two debates sustained a polling bump.Of 16 non-Biden references by candidates to Obama during last week’s debate, 13 were positive references to the 44th president.The more incremental approach advocated by Biden and others leaves the private insurance system in place but adds an option for more people to get covered through the public sector.Importantly, Biden’s public option is accessible to many more people than the one you may have heard about back when the Obama administration was contemplating this addition (disclosure: I was Biden’s chief economist).He intends to run on a similar platform of democratic socialist reform Getty 2/22 Joe Biden The former vice president - poised to be a frontrunner - has announced his run.He intends to run on a similar platform of democratic socialist reform Getty 2/22 Joe Biden The former vice president - poised to be a frontrunner - has announced his run.Snap told me it has launched a political ad library in recent days that will list all political and advocacy ads on its platform; so far, the library includes more than 1,000 ads purchased in 2019 promoting President Trump, and 2020 rivals former vice president Joe Biden and Sen.

Media might be intrigued enough to find out, despite gaffes, why former vice president Joe Biden is so far ahead with African American voters.She still trails Biden with all of those types of voters except for white liberals, among whom the two are roughly tied at a quarter of the vote.” Hint: So far.Biden’s voters don’t give a darn about gaffes.The former campaign aide extolled the president for getting “more votes than any candidate in the history of the Republican Party.”

He also took a swipe at Trump’s 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton, and her handling of emails, and criticized the “Obama-Biden administration” for its inability to stop Russia election interference — dropping the name of the former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate.“That fell to the Obama-Biden administration and they failed.Joe Biden’s record player.The combative former campaign aide extolled Trump for ‘‘receiv[ing] more votes than any candidate in the history of the Republican Party,’’ lavishing praise on him for creating a ‘‘historical movement.’’

Trump, who was watching the hearing, hailed the performance.Former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Amy Klobuchar (MN) have made their supposed appeal to Midwestern voters a central part of their “electability” pitch.“I’m accustomed to winning places like Pennsylvania and Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin,” Biden boasted at a campaign stop this summer.This weekend, Joe Biden was attacked for another bizarre, almost free association, remark.Responding to a question from the moderator Linsey Davis about what it would take to repair the legacy of slavery in America, Biden had a long, confusing reply.Taken along with his other recent statements, and the fact that he opposed bussing and other attempts to remedy the very institutional segregation he mentions, liberals like Time’s Anand Giridharadas have called Biden “racist, classist, incoherent”.The only problem is, wrong as Biden is, he’s just repeating what has been commonsense for generations of politicians, Democrat and Republican alike.You can hear echoes, more vicious than Biden’s comments last week, in the National Review complaint that many poor white people were suffering because of “Bad decisions and basic human failure …” or in JD Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy, which opines that “you can walk through a town where 30% of the young men work fewer than twenty hours a week and find not a single person aware of his own laziness”.But the solution isn’t Biden taking sensitivity courses and being less racist or “classist” – we need to combat the real sources of racial and class inequality.There’s nothing wrong with Joe Biden that doesn’t afflict the political establishment as a whole.This has already been a point of contention in the presidential race, particularly between former vice president Joe Biden, who has proposed creating a voluntary public insurance plan anyone could buy into, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who supports a single-payer Medicare-for-all plan.AD

AD

As Biden argued at a union event on Tuesday, “You’ve broken your neck to get” health insurance in contract negotiations, and “you’ve given up wages to get it.” He added, “No plan should take it away from you if that’s what you decide.”

Biden is not the first to argue that it would be unfair to union members to eliminate employer-sponsored insurance if they had to fight for it.While she trails Biden in most polls, she often matches him or even beats him on alternative measures, like which candidates voters are considering or how favorable they feel toward them (see here, for example).AD

If the race comes to be understood as a contest primarily between Warren and Biden, it makes for the kind of clear contrast we’re all drawn to.The polls show that the best-known Democrats — former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — are the strongest candidates against him, which likely boosts them in the polls.The pointless early polls, explained

According to a set of Fox News polls released on September 19, the Democrat who does best against Trump is Biden.On September 11, an ABC/Washington Post poll said that Biden does best, followed by Sanders, followed by Warren, followed by Harris.Looked at in isolation, you could view Biden’s strength in these polls as reflecting his moderate ideology.The Fox poll has him at 38 against Biden versus 40 against Harris.What I know for sure is that there’s no way she’d lose to Biden by 28 points and also no way way that O’Rourke would fare 21 points worse than Biden in a matchup with her.The fact that she’s three years younger than Trump should stop this from being a general election liability, and the fact that she’s younger than either Sanders or Biden will definitely keep it from being a primary election liability.On the flip side Biden has positioned himself as the candidate of continuity with Barack Obama.But Obama didn’t vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq (Biden says it was a mistake), didn’t have a record as the leader of a misguided “tough on crime” push in the 1990s, and — rather famously — is a standout orator rather than a gaffe machine.Biden, who as a presidential candidate has bombed in the Iowa caucuses (drawing only about 1 percent in 2008), now secures a healthy chunk of the vote and, perhaps more important, gets a 76 percent positive opinion rating.If Biden does falter, these two candidates have the opportunity to cast themselves as the center-left alternatives.Equally important, in the wake of his nasty attacks on Biden’s age in the last debate, 60 percent have ruled out Julián Castro.Or even of Joe Biden, for that matter.The media repeatedly make the mistake of grading Biden poorly on the basis of gaffes or rambling; his supporters don’t care, and if anything, he has become a more sympathetic figure.Former vice president Joe Biden, who has the highest name recognition among the Democratic primary field, has so far favored smaller-scale events.Read more:

The misfires, like Biden’s, are not necessarily a new phenomenon.Health care is always an issue in American workplaces, even if you happen to have a union who, as former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden said at an AFL-CIO convention earlier this year, “negotiated really hard for your benefits.” This is an issue no employer would need to fight with an employee over if Medicare-for-all was a reality.AD

Joe Biden has spoken about the problem in these sorts of terms.Speaking at a forum hosted by the Philadelphia Council of the AFL-CIO, former vice president Joe Biden criticized Medicare-for-all as injurious to organized labor.Under mine, you can keep your health insurance you’ve bargained for if you like it,” Biden said.Read more:

“When you’re not candid about what you’re going to do, it makes it very difficult,” Biden told reporters Friday.Former U.S. housing secretary Julián Castro found himself on defense after inaccurately suggesting at the last debate that Biden, 76, had forgotten what he had said a few minutes earlier.Two others, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), left the race shortly after using their prime-time debate time to attack Biden directly.“If you look at Biden, for example, he has taken incoming essentially every day of the campaign since he got in — frankly since before he got in — and his support hasn’t moved.An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll on Tuesday showed Warren slightly edging Sanders and Biden among Latinos, and polling higher than Sanders among whites without a college degree.Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, called Biden “Pinocchio Joe” on Twitter on Tuesday, after Biden claimed at a union event that he had always supported union causes.Another adviser called Biden “the senator from MBNA,” a reference to a prominent Delaware bank.In its basic structure, Buttigieg’s plan is very similar to what Joe Biden proposed.But before you assume that makes it some kind of centrist sellout, remember that Biden’s plan is quite progressive, especially compared with the Affordable Care Act.AD

AD

Like Biden and others, Buttigieg would create a public option that anyone could buy into.But there may also be a lot of Democratic voters — maybe even a majority of them — who like the sound of Medicare-for-all but also would be okay with a public-option approach like Biden’s or Buttigieg’s.Open the investigation Biden has demanded.Biden has responded to critics by saying if dealing with the other side is impossible, you might as well give up on self-governance.At any rate, the “scared” pitch refers to the “electability” argument that posits Biden is a safer choice to beat President Trump so voters should go with him.In the RealClearPolitics average, Biden leads Trump by nearly 12 points.See, Biden is the most electable!This doesn’t mean Biden will inevitably win because of loss aversion.AD

By contrast, Jill Biden, an educator who might know a thing or two about psychology, laid out a perfect argument to demonstrate loss aversion.Painting Biden as risky -- because of age or proclivity to ramble or whatever -- and herself as the one to run rings around Trump might be a better bet.Alternatively, she can wait around for a meltdown moment when Biden demonstrates how risky he really is.Over the same span, two online CBS/YouGov polls from Iowa have shown him in second place, within five and three points of Joe Biden for the lead.About the only thing we can say is that Biden seems to do slightly worse in the two earliest states than he does nationally.(For instance, in response to our queries about a fact check, Biden recently admitted he misspoke about his opposition to the Iraq War.)The day before, the president tweeted his ire at a similar Washington Post–Schar School poll that found 49% of Americans want him impeached for pressuring Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden.Weld sounded more impressed with former vice president Joe Biden, who is atop most of the Democratic polls.“I’ve known Biden the longest of any of these folks,” Weld said.The approach favored by Buttigieg, Biden, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and other moderates would be cheaper and allow people to gradually migrate to Medicare (if that is what they want).Trump’s immigration restrictionism, traditionally Republican economic policies, withdrawal from international climate agreements and racial antagonism feel like a crisis to many progressives, and former vice president Joe Biden — the supposedly electable establishment poll leader — is far from their first choice.They want someone to run unapologetically from the left, beat Trump and Biden using moral arguments, and usher in (or at least try for) a new era of progressive policy.And that’s something they all agree on.”

And if there is a candidate with a unique edge on that issue, the polls suggest that it’s Biden, not because of any galvanizing moral clarity, but on more prosaic grounds.Almost half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters believe that Biden has the best chance of beating Trump, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll.Most Democrats say they’re prioritizing electability over policy purity in this primary, and that’s helping Biden.They see Trump as a disaster that must be stopped and think Biden is their best bet to stop him.Biden might accidentally remind voters of his advanced age, and a loss in Iowa or New Hampshire could convince Democrats that he’s not as “electable” as he seems.But if Biden does lose — and there’s a very solid chance of that happening — it likely won’t look like or feel like Clinton’s 2008 loss to Obama.And anything I do, I fight for this country.”

Trump also attempts to deflect attention on to Biden in comments to reporters Friday, claiming that "it doesn't matter what I discussed" with world leaders.Biden fired back later in the day , telling reporters at a campaign stop that "not one single, credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion.""I have no comment except the president should start to be president," Biden added.Sept. 21: Trump doubles down, slams media for ignoring Biden story

In tweets addressing the issue Saturday, the president accused media outlets of ignoring the allegations Republicans have leveled against Biden over the Ukraine issue while again defending his own conversations with Ukraine's president."The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine," Trump tweeted."Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster," he added.Biden himself addressed the issue further on Saturday, telling reporters that Trump was abusing his authority as president to affect the 2020 race.Joe Biden: The former vice president is scheduled to speak at a town hall focusing on “climate and other issues” on Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, according to a Facebook event.Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen.

Trump reiterated his contention that his July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a “perfect call.” That call was the one in which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.Trump has repeatedly attacked Schiff for a statement in a hearing last month in which he embellished the transcript of the July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.Schiff embellished the transcript of the July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.Reports suggest that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, as a condition for U.S. release of the funds.Hunter Biden had business dealings in the Ukraine earlier this decade, and the New York Times reported this year that Joe Biden, as vice president, had traveled to Ukraine and threatened to have the United States withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees to the country unless it dismissed its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a company for which Hunter Biden served as a board member.Joe Biden’s demand was part of a larger effort by the United States and other Western allies, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to promote reform in the country against corruption, which Shokin had allegedly turned a blind eye to.The current prosecutor general in Ukraine said he had no evidence that either Biden committed any wrongdoing.But that hasn’t kept Trump and Giuliani from arguing that there should be a Biden investigation.He repeatedly pushed for Ukraine to investigate Biden in the media and in private meetings with Ukrainian officials.Giuliani first denied he asked Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden only to reverse himself 30 seconds later.He then took to Twitter to say that Trump asking Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden was completely appropriate, which the White House denies ever happened.Trump, reportedly, pressed Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden, at a time when the U.S. was weighing whether to send millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, though the aid allegedly didn’t come up on the call.Certainly Ukraine's foreign friends — among them the International Monetary Fund, several European governments and former vice president Joe Biden, who often represented the Obama administration in Ukraine — pushed the previous government hard to create institutions that would fight corruption, and not just talk about it.In Kyiv, many believe the delay was caused by Trump's demand that Zelensky's government conduct a series of spurious, politicized investigations, designed both to smear Biden and to exonerate Paul Manafort, who was deeply involved with the most corrupt part of the Ukrainian political class for many years.AD

In May, Giuliani canceled a controversial planned trip to Ukraine that he had admitted was intended to apply pressure on its government to investigate Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his work for a Ukrainian gas company that had previously been of interest to investigators in the country.Asked Friday if he had discussed Biden with Zelensky, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, “It doesn’t matter what I discussed.”

Trump then referenced allegations that Biden, as vice president, had inappropriately pressured Ukraine to dismiss the prosecutor who investigated his son, adding that reporters should pursue the matter.Biden did urge Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, with the threat of withholding U.S. aid, but his position reflected that of the U.S. government and several other Western countries more broadly for other reasons.House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) said he was troubled by reports that the whistleblower’s allegations concerned Ukraine and doubly troubled that Giuliani openly admitted during a television interview Thursday night to trying to get Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden’s family.Giuliani, who has long been lobbying Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 elections, immediately began arguing with Cuomo over the merits of a Ukrainian investigation into Biden and his son Hunter.(Back in May, Ukraine’s prosecutor general said there was no evidence that Biden or his son broke the law.)After the CNN host noted that Giuliani was obviously doing this for political purposes to serve his client—Democratic lawmakers are currently probing Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden—Giuliani flip-flopped on his position within 30 seconds.“You’re saying that’s what Biden said to the Ukraine,” Cuomo responded to Giuliani’s claim that then-Vice President Biden bribed the Ukrainian president to squash an investigation into Hunter.“Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?”

“No, actually I didn’t,” Giuliani answered.“I asked Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton.”

“You never asked anything about Hunter Biden, you never asked anything about Joe Biden to the prosecutor?” Cuomo asked, prompting Giuliani to assert that he had only asked why the case into Hunter’s company was dismissed.“So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden,” Cuomo shot back.“You are not fair and impartial,” Giuliani seethed after telling Cuomo he’d never give him documents that prove his allegations against Biden because the CNN host is “the enemy.”

“You are totally biased and your network is a creature of a Democratic National Committee,” Giuliani added.Have a good night.”

Shortly after his battle with Cuomo and another (much friendlier) interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, Giuliani took to Twitter to essentially admit that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden.“Maybe if Obama did that the Biden Family wouldn’t have bilked millions from Ukraine and billions from China; being covered up by a Corrupt Media.”It is no secret that Trump and his attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, have been pressuring Ukraine to open a corruption investigation into Democratic front-runner Joe Biden.Their contention is that Biden, as vice president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine’s top prosecutor because he was probing a company that employed Biden’s son.So rather than fomenting corruption, Biden was fighting it.On Sept. 5, The Post’s editorial page reported that Trump had put a hold on $250 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine to force Zelensky to launch a probe of Biden.AD

Kiev’s own readout of the call between Zelensky and Trump says that Trump urged Ukraine to “complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.” Vice President Pence, who recently met with Zelensky, was asked by a reporter whether they discussed Biden and whether he could offer assurances that the hold-up of funds to Ukraine “has absolutely nothing to do with efforts … to dig up dirt on the Biden family.” Pence denied that Biden was discussed but pointedly would not deny that the administration had stopped the funds to spur an investigation.Speculation over reported promise to foreign leader mounts as Giuliani seems to admit to pressing Ukraine to investigate Biden

President Trump's attorney says he had spoken with a Ukrainian official about Joe Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who investigated Biden's son.Earlier this year Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, canceled a trip to Ukraine over a perceived conflict of interest between his ties to the White House and his apparent partisan political mission to dig for dirt against Biden, whose son once had a role in a Ukrainian gas company.2019 U.S. political scandal

A request by U.S. President Trump (right) to Ukrainian President Zelensky (left) to investigate Joe Biden and his son sparked the controversy.[1][2][3] The scandal revolves around efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump and his surrogates to encourage Ukraine and other foreign countries to investigate former vice president and current 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and to additionally enlist those countries' assistance with the Department of Justice's current investigation into the origins of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.A non-verbatim transcript of the Trump–Zelensky call confirmed that Trump requested investigations of the Bidens and a debunked conspiracy theory involving a Democratic National Committee server, while urging Zelensky to work with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.[15][16] Trump has also publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens.[17]

Summary

The controversy was launched by a whistleblower report which revealed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July 2019 to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's potential opponent in the 2020 presidential election, as well as his son Hunter Biden and the company CrowdStrike, and to discuss these matters with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.[13][14][20] Trump acknowledged he had told Zelensky "we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."[21] The whistleblower alleged that the call was part of a wider campaign by Trump, his administration, and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, which may have included Trump's cancelling a scheduled trip to Ukraine by Vice President Mike Pence, and Trump withholding $400 million in military aid from Ukraine.[38][39][40] On October 3, after Trump publicly called for China and Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden,[41] Federal Election Commission (FEC) chair Ellen Weintrau reiterated that "it is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S.[50] In October 2019, after mentioning that the United States has "tremendous power" in the trade war with China "if they don't do what we want", Trump publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens.[17] As of October 2019, there has been no evidence produced of any alleged wrongdoing by the Bidens.[51] Trump, his supporters, and right-wing media have spread multiple conspiracy theories regarding Ukraine, the Bidens, the whistleblower, and the foreign interference in the 2016 election.[59][60]

Ukraine and the Bidens

In 2014, the Obama administration was trying to provide diplomatic support to the post-2014 Ukrainian revolution Yatsenyuk government in Ukraine, and then-vice president Joe Biden was "at the forefront" of those efforts.[61] Biden's son Hunter Biden joined the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company, on April 18, 2014.[62][65][66] In a December 2015 interview, Joe Biden said he had never discussed Hunter's work at Burisma.[67] Joe Biden traveled to Ukrainian capital Kiev on April 21, 2014, and urged the Ukrainian government "to reduce its dependence on Russia for supplies of natural gas.[62] Shokin has stated he believes he was fired because of his Burisma investigation, where Hunter Biden was allegedly a subject; however, that investigation was dormant at the time Shokin was fired.[67][72] In December 2015, then-vice president Biden visited Kiev and informed the Ukrainian government that $1 billion in loan guarantees would be withheld unless anti-corruption reforms were implemented, including the removal of Shokin.[75] Biden was not alone in targeting Shokin for anti-corruption reasons; he was joined by other European and U.S. officials.[77]

Hunter Biden in 2013

As of October 2019, there is no evidence that Biden acted to protect his son's involvement with Burisma, although Trump, Giuliani, and their allies have fueled speculation.Lutsenko stated in May 2019 that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, but he was planning to provide information to attorney general Bill Barr about Burisma board payments so American authorities could verify whether Hunter Biden had paid U.S.[83] On May 10, Giuliani canceled a scheduled trip to Ukraine where he had intended to urge president-elect Zelensky to pursue inquiries into Hunter Biden, as well as whether Democrats colluded with Ukrainians to release information about Manafort.Since March 2019, while Giuliani was pressing the Ukrainian administration to investigate the Bidens, a group of businessmen and Republican donors used their ties to Trump and Giuliani to try to replace the leadership of Ukrainian state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz.Firtash's attorneys obtained a September statement from Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who was forced out under pressure from multiple countries and non-governmental organizations, as conveyed to Ukraine by Joe Biden.Shokin asserted in the statement that Biden actually had him fired because he refused to stop his investigation into Burisma.Giuliani, who asserts he has "nothing to do with Firtash," has promoted the statement in television appearances as evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens."[96][97] Bloomberg News reported on October 18 that during the summer of 2019 Firtash associates began attempting to dig up dirt on the Bidens in an effort to solicit Giuliani's assistance with Firtash's legal matters, as well as hiring diGenova and Toensing in July.[101]

Communications with Ukrainian officials

A memorandum with a non-verbatim record of the call between Trump and Zelensky released by the White House

On September 20, 2019, The Washington Post reported that Trump had in a July 25 conversation repeatedly pressed Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate matters relating to Hunter Biden.[102] The New York Times reported that Trump told Zelensky to speak to Giuliani,[103][104] and according to The Wall Street Journal, he urged Zelensky "about eight times" to work with Giuliani and investigate Biden's son.[87] On September 22, Trump acknowledged he had discussed Joe Biden during the call with Zelensky, and that he had said: "We don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating [sic] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."[21] As of October 2019, there has been no evidence produced of any of the alleged wrongdoing by the Bidens.[25]

Days before Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, Giuliani spoke on the phone with Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak [uk] about a Biden investigation, as well as a prospective White House meeting between Zelensky and Trump that was sought by Ukrainian officials.[106] According to Zelensky's advisor Serhiy Leshchenko, Trump was willing to have a phone conversation with Zelensky only on the precondition that they discuss the possibility of investigating the Biden family.Leshchenko later sought to backtrack his comments, saying he did not know if officials had viewed discussing Biden as a precondition for a meeting.[109][110][111][a] In the call, Trump pressed for an investigation into the Bidens and CrowdStrike, saying: "I would like to have the [U.S.] Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it."[110] Trump falsely told Zelensky "Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution" of his son, Hunter; Biden did not stop any prosecution, did not brag about doing so, and there is no evidence his son was ever under investigation.Appearing on television on September 19, Giuliani first denied he had asked Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden, but moments later stated, "Of course I did."[124][125][126] Former prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko told the Los Angeles Times Giuliani had repeatedly demanded that the Ukrainians investigate the Biden family.[132]

American embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concerns about Giuliani's meetings, and during closed-door congressional testimony on October 4, Volker reportedly stated he had warned Giuliani that Ukrainian political figures were giving him untrustworthy information about the Bidens.[27][85] He also testified that Joe Biden was a "man of integrity", saying: "I have known former vice president Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son simply has no credibility to me.[114] Trump also asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son.[155]

On September 9, before news of the whistleblower complaint, three Democratic-controlled House committees—the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform—announced they would investigate whether Trump and Giuliani attempted to coerce Ukraine into investigating the Bidens by withholding the military aid.[45] He originally said that the aid was not released due to "corruption" in the country and that the topic of conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky was about "the fact that we don't want our people, like vice-president Biden and his son, [adding] to the corruption already in the Ukraine".[190]

In addition to the July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president Zelensky, the whistleblower alleged that Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, had engaged in a campaign to pressure Ukrainian authorities to pursue Joe Biden, including in an August 2 meeting in Madrid between Giuliani and Zelensky aide as "a direct followup" to the July 25 call and contact with a number of other officials in Zelensky's government.[7][201]

China

On October 3, Trump publicly called on China to investigate Hunter Biden's business activities there while his father was vice president.[46] "Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine," Trump told reporters.[41] In 2013, Biden, Devon Archer, and Chinese businessman Jonathan Li founded BHR Partners, a business focused on investing Chinese capital in companies based outside of China.[202][203][80] In September, Trump falsely claimed Biden "walk[ed] out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund" and earned "millions" of dollars from the BHR deal."[29]

The day after Trump's call for China to investigate Hunter Biden, Mitt Romney said: "it strains credulity to suggest that [the request] is anything other than politically motivated."[206]

Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute and a Trump advisor on trade negotiations with China, was quoted by the Financial Times on October 10: "I got quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese.[210] The decision to look into impeachment came after Pelosi consulted with allies, and after reports over a seven day period "... that Trump may have pressured a foreign leader to investigate former vice president and potential 2020 campaign rival Joe Biden and his family.[23][109][211] Concurrently, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky, confirming that Trump had asked Zelensky to "look into" the Biden controversy as a favor.[233] Kent also directed attention to Giuliani’s “disinformation” operation which planned to enroll a Ukrainian prosecutor to slander Trump opponents: Joseph Biden, Marie Yovanovitch, and Ukrainians believed to have circulated harmful information about Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman, during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.In reference to Joe and Hunter Biden, those familiar with his testimony said Kent told investigators that as early as 2015 he had attempted to voice concerns about the then-Vice President's son sitting on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.What the deputy assistant secretary of state found to be a valid concern was only ignored by Joe Biden's staff.He additionally testified that he had concern that Hunter Biden’s position at Burisma would only complicate U.S. diplomatic efforts to convince the Ukrainian government that they should avoid displaying conflicts of interest.He worried that the younger Biden's board service could be seen as an opportunity to gain influence with Joe Biden.Click on image to expand and read

George Soros

In late-September television appearances, Giuliani asserted without offering any evidence that George Soros, a frequent subject of conservative conspiracy theories, was running an anti-Trump scheme in Ukraine while Biden was protecting Soros from prosecution there.A months-long campaign by President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to reportedly pressure the Ukraine government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s potential rival in the 2020 election, has gripped the nation’s capital.As these events unfold, the aim of the chronology below is to provide a useful reference for the context and timeline on Ukraine, the roles of Joe Biden and his son Hunter there, and Trump and Giuliani’s efforts to persuade Ukraine to pursue investigations against them.Our assessments and views of the available public information are reflected in two pieces: Viola Gienger’s “Trump and Giuliani’s Quest for Fake Ukraine ‘Dirt’ on Biden: An Explainer” and our forthcoming, “The Swiftboating of Joe Biden.”

This chronology will be updated as new information becomes available.April 2014 – Hunter Biden joins Ukrainian firm Burisma

Joe Biden’s younger son, Hunter Biden, joins the board of Burisma Holdings, the largest private oil and gas extracting company in Ukraine, controlled by founder Mykola Zlochevskiy, who had served as a Cabinet minister under former pro-Russian Presidents Leonid Kuchma and Yanukovych.An American business partner of Hunter Biden, Devon Archer, also joins the board.The company issues a press release about the Biden appointment in May (see below).The appointment draws criticism for the potential perception of a conflict of interest with Vice President Biden’s role as the White House’s point man on Ukraine.News reports later in 2014 reveal that Hunter Biden had been discharged from the Navy in February for testing positive for cocaine (clearly just months before the Burisma board appointment).May 12, 2014 – Burisma Holdings issues a press release saying Hunter Biden has joined its board, and that he will be “in charge of the Holdings’ legal unit and will provide support for the company among international organizations.” The release cites his then-current positions as counsel to New York-based law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP and co-founder and a managing partner of investment advisory firm Rosemont Seneca Partners, where he also served as board chairman.While suspicions remain over how Zlochevskiy obtained his wealth and what happened to taxpayer money while he held public office, the British judge in the January 2015 U.K. judgment observed, “Allegations of corruption against political opponents appear to have been a feature of Ukrainian political life at this time.”

Oct. 14, 2014 – Ramping up Ukraine anti-corruption forces

Ukraine’s Parliament passes a law establishing the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), a priority of anti-corruption campaigners who’d helped lead the revolution and of the U.S. government (led by Biden) and other international backers of Ukraine.Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt excoriates officials in the Prosecutor General’s Office for stymying anti-corruption investigations, including those involving Burisma

Pyatt’s speech was part of a regular drumbeat by U.S. and other Western leaders, including Vice President Biden, and a swath of Ukrainian civil society seeking to pressure President Poroshenko to force his officials, especially in the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGO) to crack down more, not less, on corruption.In other words, Pyatt is critical of the prosecutor’s office for not aiding in investigations of Burisma’s owner, which was in line with Biden’s criticism that the office was blocking corruption investigations.Oct. 8, 2015 – U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland continues the drumbeat on the need for stepped-up anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in testimony that “the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGO) has to be reinvented as an institution that serves the citizens of Ukraine, rather than ripping them off.” She continues, “That means it must investigate and successfully prosecute corruption and asset recovery cases, including locking up dirty personnel in the PGO itself.”

Fall 2015 – Biden, along with the EU, publicly calls for ouster of Prosecutor General Shokin for failure to work on anti-corruption efforts.U.S. Vice President Joe Biden spoke publicly about this before and during his December visit to Kyiv.”

Dec. 8, 2015 – Vice President Biden makes a speech to Ukraine’s Parliament urging the country to step up anti-corruption measures.In a speech covered widely in news media, Biden implores Ukrainian lawmakers to move more quickly to fight the country’s “historic battle against corruption” and “make real the Revolution of Dignity.” (Many of the lawmakers themselves were former businessmen and suspected of corruption and therefore that much less interested in fighting graft.)The big part of moving forward with your IMF program — it requires difficult reforms.”

Full text of Biden’s speech.Jan. 21, 2016 – Vice President Biden meets with Ukrainian President Poroshenko and discusses “the need to continue to move forward on Ukraine’s anti-corruption agenda,” according to a readout on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.Feb. 11, 2016 – Vice President Biden speaks with Poroshenko by phone.A U.S. Embassy statement said the two agreed “that it is essential for Ukraine to continue to take action to root out corruption and implement reforms.”

Biden later boasts about the pressure he exerted on Ukraine during that time to address corruption.In a Jan. 23, 2018, Q&A following a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in Washington, Biden touts his tough stance with Ukraine in 2016.President Trump and Rudy Giuliani have cited that boast repeatedly as proof that Biden admitted pushing for Shokin’s firing, even though Biden was calling for the prosecutor to be fired because he wasn’t pursuing corruption cases vigorously enough.In the CFR appearance, Biden makes the comments in the context of expressing his concern that Ukraine still was not getting tough enough on corruption.And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.” Biden continued, “So they made some genuine substantial changes institutionally and with people.But … there’s now some backsliding.” (Biden had boasted about this episode in an interview in Aug.As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office.”

Note: Investigation of Burisma laid dormant at the time

Vitaliy Kasko, a former deputy prosecutor general who had worked under Shokin and resigned in frustration at his stymying of corruption investigations, told Bloomberg News (in a May 2019 interview) that the office’s probe into Burisma Holdings had been long dormant by the time Joe Biden issued his ultimatum in 2016.The respected English-language Kyiv Post writes, “By the end of his term, he was likely one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine, having earned a bad reputation for inaction and obstructing top cases.” The paper also says it “wasn’t able to find any public comments that Shokin made about [Burisma] during his 14 months in office.”

Feb. 18 and 19, 2016 – Vice President Biden speaks by phone with Ukrainian President Poroshenko.The Feb. 19 U.S. Embassy statement says Biden again urged the Ukrainian leader to “to accelerate Ukraine’s efforts to fight corruption, strengthen justice and the rule of law, and fulfill its IMF requirements.”

April 4, 2016 — George Kent, then charge d’Affaires in Kyiv, writes letter to Deputy Prosecutor General Yuriy Stolyarchuk re apparent pressure campaign on anti-corruption work and advocates inside and outside the office.April 14, 2016 – Vice President Biden speaks with Ukrainian President Poroshenko by phone, emphasizing “the urgency of putting in place a new Prosecutor General who would bolster the agency’s anti-corruption efforts and strongly support the work of its reformers.” Biden does the same in a call the same day with newly elected Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman.According to the New York Times, “Lutsenko initially took a hard line against Burisma.”

May 13, 2016 — Biden speaks with Poroshenko to commend the appointment of Lutsenko and the creation of an inspector general for the PGO, and informed the Ukrainian President that the U.S. would finally sign the $1 billion loan guarantee program.He also tells the paper that Giuliani pressed him repeatedly to open an investigation on the Bidens and Burisma, even though Lutsenko had seen no evidence of legal wrongdoing.March 2019 –- Ukraine Prosecutor General Lutsenko opens two investigations — one into the 2016 U.S. presidential election and a second into Burisma and Biden.“The decision to reopen the investigation into Burisma was made … by the current Ukrainian prosecutor general [Lutsenko], who had cleared Hunter Biden’s employer more than two years ago.[Note: Solomon and Fox News’s Sean Hannity are among a constellation of conservative media figures who regularly help spread Trump and Giuliani’s Biden and Manafort theories as well as other right-wing conspiracy theories, such as Uranium One, which have been debunked and shown to exclude vital information.More than 25,000 retweets later, the Ukrainian collusion narrative went viral.”

Solomon later airs part of the video interview in which Lutsenko raises allegations against Biden and Burisma, and says he wants to present his information to Attorney General William Barr.Trump tweets on March 20 in response to Solomon’s report and cites the headline: “As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.” Giuliani tweets: “keep your eye on Ukraine.”

The Wall Street Journal reported (Oct. 3): “President Trump ordered the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine after months of complaints from allies outside the administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, that she was undermining him abroad and obstructing efforts to persuade Kyiv to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.” The Journal continued: “State Department officials were told this spring that Ms. Yovanovitch’s removal was a priority for the president” and “Secretary of State Mike Pompeo supported the move,” the Journal adds.Their motivation is to try to discredit the special counsel’s investigation; undermine the case against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s imprisoned former campaign chairman; and potentially to damage Mr. Biden, the early front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.” The news ignites a firestorm of bipartisan condemnation that Giuliani is improperly seeking the help of a foreign government to benefit Trump’s re-election campaign.Giuliani says he received such information “about three or four months ago.” Giuliani also discusses his theory about the Bidens in Ukraine, and he tries to implicate the U.S. Embassy in both.May 10, 2019 – President Trump says in an interview with Politico, “Certainly it would be an appropriate thing” for him to ask Attorney General Barr to open an investigation on Biden.Trump says he sees Biden as the clear front-runner in the Democratic race and likens it to his own surge toward the Republican nomination in 2016.May 16, 2019 – Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Lutsenko tells Bloomberg News that he has “no evidence of wrongdoing” by either of the Bidens and that neither Hunter Biden nor Burisma were the focus of any current investigation.He said he planned to give U.S. authorities information about Burisma board payments, so that the U.S. could check whether Hunter Biden had paid taxes on his income, though there were no restrictions in Ukraine on how much a company could pay to its board members.Sondland says later in prepared testimony for the House investigation that “It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the President’s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani.” He also says, “I did not understand until much later that Mr. Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son.”

In what appears to be a separate White House meeting organized by White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney for the same day, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent and other U.S. officials are told that three people would be in charge of Ukraine policy, according to CNN, which cited senior Oversight Committee member Rep. Gerry Connolly’s account of Kent’s closed-door testimony to the House investigation.June 18, 2019 — The Department of Defense announces the $250 million plan “for additional training, equipment, and advisory efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine’s armed forces.”

June 21, 2019 — Giuliani tweets, “New Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden bribery of Pres Poroshenko.Time for leadership and investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Obama people.”

July 10, 2019 — Sondland appears to have raised Biden investigation with Ukrainians in White House meeting.Senior officials understood Sondland’s statement to be a reference to Burisma and Biden.“Bolton went ballistic” after the meeting, the official said.”

July 11, 2019 — The day after Sondland’s apparent reference to Trump’s desired Biden investigations, Energy Secretary Perry tries to persuade Bolton to schedule a Trump-Zelenskyy call and assures him that he, Sondland and Volker were certain that, as the Wall Street Journal paraphrased, “Zelensky wouldn’t prove an obstacle to any investigations into alleged corruption.”

Early to mid-July – Trump orders suspension and review of U.S. aid to Ukraine

President Trump tells his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine at least a week before his phone call with Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy, the Washington Post reports.Mr. Giuliani in response suggested that Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden’s relationship with Burisma,” the Wall Street Journal reports (on Sept. 26).Before the release of the transcript, Trump admits he discussed Biden on the call (see Sept. 22 below) and says U.S. funding for Ukraine is at stake (see Sept. 22-23 below).The two were on opposite sides of an internal White House feud over whether to acquiesce to President Trump’s campaign to press the Ukrainian government for an investigation of Biden, with Bolton opposed and Mulvaney facilitating with steps such as setting up the May 23 Trump meeting with Perry, Sondland and Volker, and scheduling the July 25 call.Having been rebuffed in June for a meeting in Kyiv with Zelenskyy personally, Giuliani flies to Madrid to press the new Ukrainian president’s aide, Yermak, for an investigation of the Bidens as well as a probe of the allegation that Ukrainians conspired with Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016 to release damaging information about Paul Manafort.From Madrid, Giuliani resurfaces his allegations against the Bidens in a tweet on Aug. 3.The hold on the aid package at the same time as Trump and Giuliani were agitating publicly for Ukraine to investigate Biden raises the specter that the U.S. president was using congressionally appropriated taxpayer dollars as leverage to coerce a foreign government to investigate his potential rival in the 2020 election.Sept. 2019 – The Wall Street Journal reports, “Ukrainian officials earlier this month expressed concern to U.S. senators that the aid had been held up as a penalty for resisting that pressure.”

Sept. 1, 2019 — The top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, chargé d’affaires Bill Taylor raises the specter of a quid pro quo in a text message to Sondland and Volker: “Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?” Sondland replies only, “Call me.”

Sept. 2, 2019 – Vice President Mike Pence, a day after meeting with the new Ukrainian president, doesn’t directly answer a reporter’s question about whether he can assure Ukrainians that the delay in $250 million of U.S. security assistance for Ukraine is unrelated to President Trump’s and Rudy Giuliani’s pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.Sept. 8 and 9, 2019 — Taylor repeats concerns in two text messages with Sondland about the idea of holding out U.S. military funding until Zelenskyy agrees to investigate Biden.Sept. 20, 2019 – A senior advisor to Ukraine’s Interior Minister challenges Trump to make an official U.S. government request if he wants an investigation of Biden.The adviser, Anton Geraschenko, told The Daily Beast that “currently there is no open investigation.” He adds, “Clearly, Trump is now looking for kompromat to discredit his opponent Biden, to take revenge for his friend Paul Manafort, who is serving seven years in prison.”

Sept. 22, 2019 – After days of insisting there was nothing inappropriate about his telephone call with Zelenskyy, President Trump acknowledges discussing Joe Biden with the Ukrainian leader during their July 25 phone call.“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Mr. Trump told reporters.Sept. 22 and 23, 2019 – Trump himself connects phone call on Biden to U.S. aid to Ukraine

President Trump, in two sets of remarks to reporters asking about his July 25 phone call with Zelenskyy, appears to confirm a connection between U.S. financial assistance for Ukraine and his pressure for the country’s leaders to pursue the investigations he wants.On Sept. 22 Trump says, “Certainly I’d have every right to [raise Biden with the Ukrainian President] if there’s corruption and we are paying lots of money to a country.”

Trump has repeatedly referred to what he falsely claims the Bidens to have done as “corruption.” “It’s very important to talk about corruption,” Trump tells the reporters on Sept. 23.Sept. 30, 2019 — Three House committees issue subpoenas to Giuliani and three associates — Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Semyon Kislin — demanding records related to efforts to pressure Ukraine to conduct politically motivated investigations, including of Joe Biden.An announcement earlier this month from the head of the House Intelligence Committee regarding an anonymous intelligence community whistleblower complaint has snowballed into a scandal encompassing a reported effort by Trump to pressure the president of Ukraine into investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.To help sort through the story, we have put together a timeline of how allegations of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine percolated up through right-wing news circles to the president’s desk, what the president and his lawyer have said and done about it, what the Ukrainian government has said about the situation, and how Congress has reacted.In 2014, then-Vice President Biden’s son Hunter joined the board of Burisma Holdings, a large private Ukrainian gas firm.Following cries from observers about Shokin’s own ineptitude and corruption and pressure from Vice President Biden, among others, Shokin was fired in 2016.Shokin’s firing drew praise from Western observers, including from the European Union’s envoy to Ukraine, who noted that the firing of Shokin “creates an opportunity to make a fresh start in the prosecutor general’s office” and expressed “hope that the new prosecutor general will ensure that [his] office ... becomes independent from political influence and pressure and enjoys public trust.”

Notably, Ukraine’s then-Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko stated in May 2019 that he was aware of no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.March 20, 2018: Conservative investigative journalist Peter Schweizer publishes a book including allegations about corruption surrounding Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine.One section of the bill bars funds from the NDAA going to “any activity that recognizes the sovereignty of the Russian Federation over Crimea.” The president indicates in a signing statement that this section does not “dictate the position of the United States in external military and foreign affairs.”

August 27, 2018: Conservative media outlet PJ Media writes that the allegations in Schweizer’s book concerning Hunter Biden will be a “central issue” in the 2020 election.March 20, 2019: John Solomon writes in The Hill that, according to Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, an ambassador to Ukraine appointed by President Barack Obama gave Lutsenko a so-called “do not prosecute list.” The State Department calls Lutsenko’s claim “an outright fabrication.”

Ben Sasse (R-NE) said, “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say there’s no there there when there’s obviously lots that’s very troubling there.”

Previously, the White House resisted calls to release the complaint, making the decision to send the document to Congress largely about the administration getting ahead of increasing scrutiny around fears President Donald Trump endeavored to strong-arm a foreign leader into investigating his potential presidential rival in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden.A September letter from the intelligence community’s inspector general to Rep. Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote “[it] relates to one of the most significant and important of the [director of national intelligence’s] responsibilities to the American people.”

Later reporting by the Washington Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and others found that the complaint included concerns about a phone call President Trump had with Ukraine, during which he reportedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “about eight times” to partner with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani — who does not hold any official government office — in an investigation into Joe Biden’s role in the firing of a former Ukrainian top prosecutor.Giuliani has argued, despite there being no evidence to support this, that Biden lobbied to have the prosecutor fired in order to protect his son, Hunter Biden, from an investigation into a Ukrainian company Hunter sat on the board of.It — along with a recollection of the call the White House released Tuesday — seem to have already shed new light on the details of the call and what Trump said about Biden.Democratic presidential candidate former vice-president Joe Biden.According to The New York Times' quoting of two other people briefed on the call, Trump repeatedly told the Ukrainian leader to talk with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had been urging the government in Kiev to investigate Biden and his family.Privately, Democrats are wondering whether the Trump administration was trying to use that money as leverage over the Ukrainian President, hopeful it would spur an investigation of Biden, who is a leading Democratic candidate for president.Biden on Friday suggested there could be a connection.They have also alleged that Obama and Biden tried to leverage US aid in their dealings with Ukraine.McCarthy was referring to comments Biden made at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018, bragging that he had threatened to withhold $US1 billion in loan guarantees, not military aid, unless Ukrainian leaders promptly fired the country's top prosecutor.US President Donald Trump's push to get Ukrainian leaders to investigate the family of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has dragged a war-torn country back into the crosshairs of American partisan politics.One energy company, Burisma, hired several well-connected Democrats, including Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, who became a board member in 2014.The younger Biden didn't provide direct support to politicians.Joe Biden has said he never spoke to his son about the Burisma work.Ukrainian prosecutors have said there is no evidence of improper behavior by Hunter Biden.Still, Trump and Giuliani have sought to propel Hunter Biden's Ukrainian business dealings into the public sphere.The Post has reported that an intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint centering on a July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump asked for an investigation into Hunter Biden.Trump on Sunday acknowledged raising the Bidens with Zelensky."The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine," Trump told reporters.Hunter Biden is no longer is on the Burisma payroll.Likewise, President Trump did not have to say to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, “Accuse Joe Biden of corruption, or you’ll never see any more aid from the United States.” It was sufficient that, according to the Wall Street Journal, in a July 25 call, Trump badgered Zelensky eight times to investigate Biden, before also withholding $250 million in military aid.As a Ukrainian official told the Daily Beast, “Clearly, Trump is now looking for kompromat to discredit his opponent Biden, to take revenge for his friend Paul Manafort, who is serving seven years in prison.”

We don’t yet know the full details because of White House stonewalling, but from what we already know, this may be the most shocking revelation of wrongdoing by Trump since he fired FBI Director James B. Comey on May 9, 2017, (by his own admission) to squelch the investigation of his Russia ties.Trump then doubled down on the spurious accusations of corruption against Biden, which have been reviewed and refuted by Ukrainian authorities and independent journalists, thereby using this as another opportunity to put the smears into public circulation.Trump’s consigliere, Rudolph W.

However, with the allegations (and virtual public confession) that Trump went to a foreign power, Ukraine, to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden, his most likely opponent, and may even have extorted Ukraine using taxpayer money, the calculus may change, dramatically so.From factually specific news reports (e.g., confirming Trump asked the Ukrainian president eight times to find dirt on Biden), we know the proof and the witnesses are out there.

KIEV, Ukraine — Ukrainian leaders are trapped in the middle of a very Washington firefight, facing mounting pressure from President Trump and his allies to investigate the son of political rival Joe Biden, and are searching for a way to escape.They could give in to Trump’s demand to open an inquiry into the Ukrainian business dealings of Hunter Biden and risk the anger of Democrats and others for engaging in what those interests would see as interference in the 2020 elections.Trump has been reluctant, and he pressed Zelensky about Biden in a July phone conversation that is the subject of an extraordinary intelligence community whistleblower complaint.The second matter raised by Giuliani involved a probe of the Ukrainian gas tycoon who put Hunter Biden on the board of his company Burisma.In 2016, then-Vice President Biden demanded the ouster of Ukraine’s top law enforcement official, Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.Trump and Giuliani have accused the elder Biden of pushing for Shokin’s dismissal to protect Hunter Biden from an investigation into Burisma.“The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,” Trump wrote Saturday on Twitter.Biden said Saturday that he had never spoken with his son about his business in Ukraine and accused Trump of “doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum.”

For months, the 2020 Democratic contenders have tried to figure out how to get around former vice president Joe Biden’s persistent lead in the polls.Warren’s lead is small, but that it exists at all hints at a potential path to victory over Biden.Biden has three advantages in this primary: association with former president Barack Obama, relative policy moderation and perceived electability.That could in turn damage Biden’s support with black voters in South Carolina .Without knowing the full extent of what did or did not happen, Republicans’ defense of the president is sure to involve a fair share of “whataboutism.” That Hunter Biden was engaged in swamp business par excellence is already well-documented, and there are questions about whether Joe Biden has ever used his position to help his son.So all this points to Biden’s vulnerability and reminds everyone that he has been in the swamp far too long.AD

The coming finger-pointing by Republicans and the demand for answers from Biden could not come at a worse time for his campaign.The latest poll from Iowa shows her inching ahead of Biden.Voters may think Biden isn’t just too old to be president, but that maybe he carries too much baggage to be the party’s nominee, as well.In the strangest of ways, the whistleblower incident is more likely to end the political career of Biden before that of Trump.Biden is a fragile front-runner and the whole matter involving his son’s foreign business dealings not only raises unflattering questions but provides plenty of reminders about his life in the swamp.Whatever it is, the latest Trump debacle seems to be a gift from the president to every Democrat who isn’t named Joe Biden.Additionally, Giuliani was getting money from these two, who were working for Trump in Ukraine, and arranged Ukraine connections for Giuliani to talk to in his quest to get anyone there to put their name to a statement claiming Biden corruption.You may remember that name as being on the front of that stapled sheaf of papers that Giuliani waved during a Fox News interview saying that it was statements from a high-ranking Ukranian proving Biden corruption in Ukraine.Trump admits the real purpose of his call to Zelinsky

A formal impeachment inquiry was launched on September 24, 2019, as a response to the Trump–Ukraine scandal, in which Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani pressed the Ukrainian government repeatedly since at least May 2019 to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden.[23][24][25][26][27] The purpose of the requested investigation was alleged to be to hurt Biden's campaign for President.There was widespread speculation that the withholding of the aid was intended to force Ukraine to investigate Biden; both Trump and Giuliani seemed to confirm that there was such a connection.Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani had been trying for months to get Ukraine to launch an investigation into former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden as well as his son Hunter Biden.A group of moderate lawmakers from swing districts is now backing an impeachment inquiry, and Democrats say there's been a significant shift in the tenor of the discussion following reports that Trump pressured Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his family.Reporting suggests that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden multiple times in a phone call in July, a demand that apparently was part of a still-secret whistleblower complaint targeting Trump’s administration.He then went on a brief, angry riff about the media and about Biden and his son Hunter Biden.“And they know about corruption, and they probably know that Joe Biden and his son are corrupt.Joe Biden and his son are corrupt.Trump’s assertion that Biden is corrupt stems from his misrepresentation or misunderstanding of a request Biden made publicly as vice president.In late 2015, Ukraine was under pressure to take a firmer stand against corruption, and Biden joined other international actors in advocating for change.But, as the New York Times reported at the time, “the credibility of the vice president’s anticorruption message may have been undermined” by Hunter Biden’s relationship with a Ukrainian energy company.That company, Trump and his allies insist, was under investigation by the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, and they accuse Biden of advocating for Shokin’s firing to protect Hunter Biden.Trump is insistent on the point, though, and tries to blur the line between what Biden did and what Trump did.Trump is framing Biden’s pressure on Ukraine in a way that makes it appear to mirror what he himself is accused of.Talking to reporters while sitting next to Polish President Andrzej Duda, Trump escalated his attacks on Biden.“If that ever happened — If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now,” Trump claimed.In fact, Trump has tried to claim that his conversation with Zelensky was an echo of exactly what Biden actually did.This is actually what Biden’s focus was.The prosecutor was fired and a new one put into place — who himself eventually investigated the company for which Hunter Biden had done work.Trump claims that Biden made that demand to protect his son, an assertion of corruption for which there’s no evidence.Trump is making that claim, meanwhile, to paper over what’s been reported: that the demand Trump made in his phone call was less about “talking corruption” than trying to gin up some statement from Ukraine that what Biden did was actually corrupt.Trump says Biden did what Trump is accused of doing; Trump claims innocence by saying he only did what the best available evidence suggests Biden had actually done.With that in the rearview mirror, Trump then reportedly embarked on an effort to do something remarkably similar to one of the worst-case allegations in the Russia probe: seek electoral assistance from a foreign nation in the form of dirt on Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate.Or worse: They’ve urged the Justice Department to investigate the political rival whom Trump sought a foreign power’s help in sullying, former vice president Joe Biden.On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave multiple interviews in which he suggested that Biden is the real party responsible for interfering in U.S. elections.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — who has elsewhere praised Trump’s “perfect genes” — likewise dismissed as “speculation” reporting that Trump directed Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden.The false stories they tell about Joe Biden and other U.S. Democrats result from this misguided alliance.AD

Viktor Shokin, who was forced out of the job of general prosecutor in 2016 following an intervention by then-Vice President Joe Biden, told Mr. Giuliani that he had been investigating a Ukrainian gas company that had given a position on its board to Mr. Biden’s son Hunter.What was left out of his account was that Mr. Biden’s intervention was part of a broad campaign by Ukrainian reformers, European governments and international financial institutions to oust Mr. Shokin, who was blocking prosecutions of corrupt officials and oligarchs.The prosecutor who replaced Mr. Shokin, Yuriy Lutsenko, subsequently stated publicly that the gas company was not under investigation at the time of Mr. Biden’s intervention, and that there has been no wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.By demanding that he investigate the “corruption” of Mr. Biden and Mr. Leshchenko, Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani of course are trying, dishonestly, to damage a potential opponent of Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential election.Or worse: They’ve urged the Justice Department to investigate the political rival whom Trump sought a foreign power’s help in sullying, former vice president Joe Biden.On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave multiple interviews in which he suggested that Biden is the real party responsible for interfering in U.S. elections.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — who has elsewhere praised Trump’s “perfect genes” — likewise dismissed as “speculation” reporting that Trump directed Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden.According to published reports about a whistleblower complaint — which the administration outrageously refuses to share with Congress — Trump, during a July phone call, badgered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to investigate Biden.Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?Biden said Saturday that “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.”

Trump’s fear is palpable.The fact that he would risk trying to muscle a foreign leader into ginning up a “scandal” to hang around Biden’s neck shows how desperately worried he is about losing the election.Trump’s reelection strategy is apparently to replace the innuendo of “Hillary’s emails” with the smarm of “Biden and Ukraine.” He should be forced to throw his mud from the dock of an impeachment trial.If such a promise related to releasing the U.S. aid in return for the Biden investigation, that could be crucial evidence of a quid pro quo.So it’s very important that, on occasion, you speak to somebody about corruption.”

Trump was essentially doing what Giuliani did Thursday: laying a preemptive defense in case it emerges that Trump did offer Ukraine something or threatened (explicitly or implicitly) to withhold something — such as $250 million in aid, which Trump did withhold for a time — in exchange for Ukraine investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.Trump refers broadly to “corruption,” but that’s the umbrella term used to talk about investigating the Bidens (conveniently, without alluding to the fact that this is an issue in which Trump has a very personal stake).But during a CNN appearance Thursday night, Giuliani admitted that he spoke with Ukrainian officials about reopening an investigation Republicans think will make former vice president Joe Biden look bad.Biden leads in polls of the Democratic presidential candidates.Late Friday, The Post reported that Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden’s son in a call between the two leaders that is at the center of the complaint, according to two people familiar with the matter.The president himself has admitted he discussed investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter with Zelensky.We know that Ukraine’s former top prosecutor was in fact fired because of his well-documented corruption, not — as Trump would have us believe — because of any investigation into Hunter Biden.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appearing on CNN’s “State of Union” supposedly to defend the president, repeatedly deflected questions with the excuse “I wasn’t on the call.” The conspiracizing came from Trump’s wild-eyed personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani; he claimed on Fox that “this town protects Joe Biden” and “the press has been covering up” for the former vice president, without a shred of evidence beyond innuendo.For those of us following at home who aren’t necessarily familiar with every episode in Biden’s Forrest Gump-like career, it can be hard to keep up.It would help to have a guide, a Bidenologist, if you will — someone to provide the context that is often missing during each 30-second attack.He has covered Biden longer than perhaps anyone and, at the age of 92, has just published an update of his 2010 biography “Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption.”

Biden’s decision to run a third time for the presidency, Witcover argues, was fueled not only by his late son Beau’s well-known wishes he do so, or by mockery from President Trump (“Sleepy Joe”), but also by the notion that the former vice president thinks he can unite an increasingly divided Democratic Party.AD

AD

Perhaps Witcover — who has written or co-written 19 books, and who still writes a syndicated column for Tribune newspapers three times a week — understands Biden so well because the two men have much in common, from their non-privileged backgrounds (Witcover calls Biden “Mr.Like Biden, Witcover has continued to work long past the typical age of retirement.“And I think probably most of it stands the test of time in history pretty darn well, and that ain’t a bad legacy.”

The Biden camp also reveres him, it seems.Ted Kaufman, Biden’s longtime chief of staff who replaced him as U.S. senator in 2009, was a key resource in Witcover’s reporting for the book.I asked Witcover what he thought of the similarities between him and Biden, and he was a bit taken aback.“I’ve never been compared to Joe Biden before!” he responded.I don’t feel that I have any particular kinship with Joe Biden, although it is true we both come from working-class backgrounds.And I think that, in this election particularly, the matter of common decency is important.”

AD

AD

Witcover and I discussed the latest round of hurdles for Biden, who is still leading in most polls of the Democratic field.Witcover insists that Biden himself never supported segregationist policies but is taking the fall for his “modus operandi ... trying to work across the aisle and having friends in the other party, not collaborators, but people with whom he could deal.”

Witcover is both a workhorse and someone simply undeterred by old age.Even from his summer home in Bethany Beach, in Biden’s home state of Delaware, Witcover works just as hard as he does from Washington.“But the thing about the deadlines is they’re very demanding and they don’t take into consideration anybody’s age or mental capacity.”

AD

AD

Witcover doesn’t want to come across as a “booster” or a “homer” for Biden, he said.He’s not necessarily rooting for anyone in the Democratic primary, but he feels Biden’s foray into the 2020 field is a net positive.“If Joe Biden as a strong voice in the Democratic conversation can somehow contribute to what should be a bipartisan effort to return normality back to American politics,” he wrote in an April column, “his decision to run will have been the right one, whether he wins the presidency or not.”

Scott Nover is a writer in Washington.A Joe Biden campaign mantra is that he, better than any other Democrat, can stand toe-to-toe against President Trump’s unruly political tactics.The former vice president came off the sidelines of the impeachment debate Tuesday as the House prepared to launch an inquiry into whether Trump pressured Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt on Biden and his son.“Stop stonewalling and provide the Congress all the facts it needs,” Biden said at a news conference in Delaware.Advertisement

Biden’s movement was significant after weeks of hedging on impeachment.Democrats are watching how Biden handles this first major, sustained attack by Trump, which came just as the president’s political difficulties have deepened, with many polls showing him trailing several of the Democratic contenders.Trump has intensified his efforts to resurface unfounded claims that Biden used his White House post to improperly advance the business interests of his son Hunter.No evidence has substantiated claims that the younger Biden acted improperly, much less that the former vice president did, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly calling both of them “corrupt.”

Biden hesitated to join the presidential race earlier this year in part because he was weighing its potential impact on his family.“I knew when I decided to run, this president would attack me and anyone else he thought would be a threat to his winning again,” Biden said.But if we allow a president to get away with shredding the United States Constitution, that will last forever.”

Many Democrats, however, have said they believe that Biden moved slowly in responding to Trump’s insinuations and that he needs to be more aggressive.How can you expect the media to hold Trump’s feet to the fire when you don’t think his actions are worthy of the biggest response Congress could take?”

Many Democrats see the attack on Biden as resonant of the tactics Trump used against Clinton.Advertisement

“This is about Donald Trump, not Joe Biden,” said Rebecca Katz, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, “but you have to be able to fight back against Donald Trump if you want to be president.We need more from all our Democratic leaders.”

Trump has admitted that during a telephone call in July, he urged the president of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.When news of the phone call and Trump’s effort to enlist Ukraine in a campaign against Biden first became public five days ago, Biden strategists initially worried that responding aggressively risked bringing fresh attention to questions they thought were settled.Advertisement

“This is the same thing as happened in 2016, and it worked because Hillary did not push back,” said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and longtime Biden backer.“He needs to push back, call Trump a criminal, and make sure the American public understands this guy has attempted to recruit a foreign country to attack or try to discredit his rival.”

Biden’s initial response to Trump’s claims was a far cry from that.On Saturday, speaking again to reporters, Biden still shied away from calling for impeachment.Over the weekend, however, the Biden campaign bulked up its defense by circulating memos to reporters and talking points to supporters to debunk Trump’s claims.At fundraising events and talking to reporters, Biden said that the attack on him demonstrated that the president considered him his most formidable rival.It’ll be ugly, it’ll be mean, it’ll be degrading,” Biden said at a St. Louis fundraiser on Sunday.“Given half a chance, I think I could beat this guy like a drum.”

Biden’s zigzagging path toward endorsing impeachment is emblematic of a Democratic Party still finding its footing under Trump’s rules – or lack of rules – of engagement.As was the case with Clinton, Biden is in an awkward place.Biden is grappling with an impeachment inquiry sparked by suspected presidential wrongdoing of which he is the victim.Given that, said Scott Mulhauser, a former Biden aide, it was not surprising Biden stopped short of fully calling for impeachment Tuesday.Context: Trump confirmed Sunday that he discussed Biden and his son Hunter during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.It is not his age but his history that bedevils Biden, and not style but substance that weighs on his candidacy.Biden got the big things wrong repeatedly over the last 40 years.Biden’s basic pitch is as the candidate of restoration.Unique among leading Democratic contenders, Biden suffers the same problems.Ironically, the weakest of these might well be Biden, burdened with defending a series of votes and positions that have not worked for most Americans.Biden is about to discover that once they take a good look, Democrats will find it hard to see him in that role.Related Ousted ambassador to Ukraine tells Congress that Trump pressured State Department to remove her

WASHINGTON — We don't yet know whether President Trump delayed some military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get Ukraine's president to reopen an investigation into Hunter Biden.So, it's OK for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it's not OK for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?And then there is Joe Biden.According to The New York Times, "Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general."But what is clear is Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: "I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours.This weekend, Biden told reporters, "I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."Moreover, the New Yorker reports, "In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter's relationship with Burisma."So, Biden was fully aware of his son's involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016.On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, announced Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, "It's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president."Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president.It will keep the story of Biden's conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election.Senate Republicans can demand Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need.The irony is the Democrats' investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump.There is an immediate cause: President Trump allegedly asked his Ukrainian counterpart to fabricate a legal case against former vice president Joe Biden and used a promise of U.S. military aid to blackmail the Ukrainian leader into agreeing.That’s what’s so outrageous about Trump’s alleged push to get dirt on his potential 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, in a July 25 phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Trump claimed he wanted to pressure “Europe and other nations to contribute to Ukraine.” Trump had suggested Sunday that in the July call he had urged Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son’s work for a Ukrainian gas company.Subscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today’s most popular stories on The Washington Post

Topline: House speaker Nancy Pelosi opened a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump on September 24 over allegations that Trump pressured a foreign power (Ukraine) to investigate a rival (Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter) for his own political gain, and will get a full congressional investigation that threatens to topple his presidency.News reports on that call — during which Trump talked about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter — have led an increasing number of House Democrats to demand impeachment proceedings against Trump because of suspicions the president tried to boost his chances of re-election by pressuring another country to probe a leading Democratic challenger.Biden said Tuesday that Trump should be impeached if he stonewalls efforts by Congress to get information about his contacts with Ukraine and other issues.Trump's authorization of release of the transcript of the call with Zelensky did not immediately reduce pressure by Congress for information about his suspected linkage of military aid to Ukraine with a willingness by that country to investigate Biden.Trump denies that he pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens during their July call.They have suggested that Joe Biden himself improperly pressured that country's leaders in 2016 to fire Viktor Shokin, a prosecutor there, because of concern that Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, a Ukraine natural gas company whose board Hunter Biden served on.And when he suggests, baselessly, that Joe Biden threatened Ukraine on behalf of his son Hunter Biden’s business and that this ridiculous lie is evidence of systemic corruption on the part of the Biden family, it manages to be both — a confession and projection.Trump is projecting his own faults onto Biden and accusing him of abusing public office to enrich his family business.It is easy to see why Trump thinks Biden must have been pulling a scam in Ukraine: It is exactly what Trump would have done.Still, Trump’s lies about the Biden family will probably gain traction with a certain constituency of Trump supporters who view the president’s feigned outrage about the imaginary misdeeds of other people as an articulation of something ineffable that they already believe about elites: that all of them are corrupt to some extent.The Washington Post broke the story last week of a government whistleblower sounding the alarm about an action of Trump's: a phone call pressing the president of Ukraine, from which Trump is withholding aid, to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Trump's political rival, who held a company board position there.They made it all about Joe Biden's supposed corruption, thus broadcasting their prime-time shows from the other side of Alice's looking glass

Here, for example, was the repeated chyron for Carlson's Ukraine segment: "Biden and Son Accused of Misconduct in Ukraine."The Ukranians haven't charged Biden or his son with any wrongdoing.Another Murdoch media property - the Wall Street Journal - admirably played it straight in a clear, explanatory article: Trump and his legal attack dog, Rudy Giuliani, "have suggested that Joe Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine's general prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in March 2016 to stop an investigation" into a company where Hunter Biden was a board member.Biden was the point man for the many Western entities, including other lenders to Ukraine, who wanted Shokin out because he was too slow to go after the country's bureaucratic corruption.The network featured video and audio clips of Trump aggressively spouting off: "What Biden did was a disgrace."Without sufficient context, the piece also included an apparently irresistible sound bite as Trump concluded a media availability with the Polish president:

If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, the national audience heard Trump asserting, "they'd be getting the electric chair by now."NBC emphasized Biden's pushback, too, but it ended up fairly even-steven - exactly the kind of thing that prompted James Fallows of the Atlantic to write a searing piece this week: "The Press is Embracing False Equivalence - Again.""The fake news doesn't want to report it," he said of his Biden-Ukraine angle, "because they're Democrats."The damage is real, wrote Media Matters' Matthew Gertz: "If journalists incorporate Trump's debunked allegations into the narrative of Biden's campaign, it will likely create a false impression of corruption."Granted, most news stories that focus on Trump's counterpunching have included a sentence or two about the meritlessness of his corruption claims against Biden.These disclaimers don't make their way into Biden-focused headlines, which is as far as many news consumers get.Perhaps he felt liberated to try to coerce the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, into undermining the presidential candidacy of former vice president Joe Biden by enlisting Zelensky in a smear campaign.President Trump ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before a phone call in which he pressured the Eastern European nation’s leader to investigate the family of political rival Joe Biden, a revelation that comes as more Democrats move toward impeachment proceedings.But my complaint has always been, and I’d withhold again and I’ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine.” He named Germany and France as among the countries that should “put up money.”

He also used the moment to again suggest that the Biden family inappropriately benefited from their ties to Ukraine.Advertisement

Later Tuesday, Biden’s presidential campaign said the candidate plans to call for Congress to impeach President Trump if the administration does not cooperate fully with all ongoing House investigations and subpoenas.Biden planned to speak this afternoon from his hometown of Wilmington, Del.Advertisement

At issue is a summer phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump is said to have pushed for investigations into Biden.Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong and has denied that any requests for help in procuring damaging information about Biden were tied to the aid freeze.“If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is, is corrupt?”

Later Monday, Trump denied telling the Ukraine president that his country would get U.S. aid only if it investigated Biden’s son.However, Pelosi said Sunday that unless the administration provides more information to Congress by the scheduled Thursday hearing at the intelligence committee, its officials “will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.”

Trump has sought, without evidence, to implicate Biden and his son Hunter in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine.Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv.“I don’t think he should have raised the topic of Joe Biden with the Ukraine president,” Rubio said.Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings in April 2014, two months after Ukraine’s Russia-friendly former president was ousted by protesters and as Biden’s father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government.And, perhaps most damaging of all for Republicans is that Trump acknowledged this weekend he may have spoken about Biden with the president of Ukraine, though he maintains he did nothing wrong in his conversation.One of the biggest unknowns is how all of this will affect the prospects of poll-leading Joe Biden.Trump’s brazen and improper play to enlist a foreign government to scuff up Biden assures that baseless allegations about him will be in the water.But even if Trump’s pressure on Ukraine failed, he continues to insist that Biden should be investigated and to spread evidence-free allegations about him.How Biden deals with it will likely be his greatest test as a candidate.As longtime Democratic operative Joe Trippi notes of the president: “The question may not be whether Biden can take him down.It may or may not help her to have Biden at center stage now.But also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China.There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden and there was with these senators.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I think you can look at your senators and you can look at Biden, and you can look at all these other people.Five hundred people were interviewed, and yet, they don’t interview Joe Biden and his son.The president asked Zelensky to work with Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and for help in finding the Democratic National Committee computer server that U.S. officials say was hacked by Russian intelligence in the run-up to the 2016 election.For months, Giuliani has been pressing the Ukrainian government behind the scenes, gathering information about Biden and briefing Trump on his findings, Giuliani told The Washington Post.Andrew Weiss, a Russia scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Giuliani's efforts to launch an investigation into Biden's son came at a particularly sensitive time in U.S.-Ukraine relations given the surprise victory of Zelensky, a political novice and former comedian, over President Petro Poroshenko this spring.But he has said that he believed something didn't add up with the 2016 release of the "black ledger" that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine's largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.It was one of a series of whipsawing declarations Mr. Trump made throughout the day on Monday as he defended himself, vilified the Bidens and appeared by turns eager and reluctant to reveal the facts at the root of the allegations.Mr. Biden chimed in via the president’s favorite social media platform, Twitter, responding to Mr. Trump’s dismissal of charges of misconduct by writing, “So release the transcript of the call then.”

Mr. Trump has acknowledged raising Mr. Biden and the corruption questions with Mr. Zelensky in the July 25 telephone call.People familiar with the conversation said Mr. Trump repeatedly urged his counterpart to speak with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, who has been pushing Ukraine aggressively to look into the Bidens and any contacts that the previous government in Kiev had with Democrats during the 2016 campaign.Just before delivering his UN speech, Trump addressed the gathering storm over his alleged effort to tie military assistance to Ukraine to Kiev’s willingness to dig up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.The polling on impeachment remained stagnant — until two weeks ago, when the speaker reacted swiftly to Trump’s admission that he asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s potential opponent in the 2020 election.In the meantime, Democrats are trying — with varying degrees of success — to push back on Trump’s unproven claims about Biden’s efforts to remove a controversial Ukrainian prosecutor, and the president’s fixation on a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election.Trump’s claims about Biden are resonating among his political base.But Trump’s efforts to paint Biden as corrupt for trying to oust a prosecutor who at one point was investigating a company tied to his son Hunter appeared to resonate among his supporters who attended Casten’s town halls — some of whom were wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and “Trump 2020” t-shirts.Right off the bat at his first town hall here, a woman tore into Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, accusing them of “lying their little butts off” and saying that a whistleblower’s complaint about Trump’s interactions with Ukraine’s president “looks like a bunch of 13-year-old girls gossiping.”

At an event later in the day in Bartlett, Ill., a constituent asked Casten why he wasn’t condemning Biden’s actions.In both instances, Casten spoke for more than five minutes about the nitty-gritty of the claims Trump and his allies have made about Biden.He unapologetically declared that there was “no ‘there’ there on the Biden story,” and after hearing a question about the unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine was responsible for meddling in the 2016 election, he told the voter that she was espousing a “deep-down-the-rabbit-hole, crazy conspiracy theory.”

Casten’s posture toward impeachment comes with real political risks.But Wood remains convinced that Trump did nothing wrong, and he took issue with the way Casten described the president’s claims about Biden, in particular his declarative statement that Trump and his supporters are “actively suppressing facts.” I witnessed the heated exchange, during which Wood and his wife accused Casten of cheapening the political discourse when he derided Trump’s immigration policies as “racist” and referred to Trump’s claims about Biden as “crackpot conspiracy theories.”

“People who ignore their morals and their ethics in order to support something or ignore the facts to support a reprehensible morality, I’m not going to pretend to — ” Casten told Wood as a staffer intervened to whisk him away to his next town hall.Last month, congressional Democrats announced the probe in response to a whistleblower's complaint that alleged Trump leveraged military aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating Vice President Joe Biden, one of his chief Democratic rivals in the 2020 election.Sixty-two percent said asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, was inappropriate – 43% said it was "very inappropriate" and 17% said "somewhat inappropriate."When asked if Biden would uphold such standards if he became president, 47% said he would and 38% said he would not.GOP senator: Trump wrong to ask Ukraine to investigate Biden but it's not 'an impeachable offense'

RELATED STORY: Read the declassified whistleblower complaint on Ukraine, Biden and TrumpJust as he did to Hillary Clinton, Andrew McCabe, James B. Comey and Robert S. Mueller III, the president is trying desperately to flip the script, this time away from his solicitation of the Ukraine president to former vice president Joe Biden.Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Rudolph Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, and U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr to investigate political rival Joe Biden, according to a transcript of the conversation released Wednesday.In the July 25 call, Trump raised unproven allegations that the former vice president tried to interfere with a Ukrainian prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son Hunter.“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that,” Trump said to Zelensky.[12]

From May to August 2019, Trump and Giuliani repeatedly pressed the government of Ukraine to investigate his political opponent Joe Biden, a former U.S. vice president and candidate for the 2020 U.S. Democratic presidential nomination, and Biden's son Hunter.[15][16] During a phone call a week later, he pressured President Zelensky to launch two investigations, including one into the actions of the Bidens.[9] In response, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the call, confirming that Trump had asked Zelensky to "look into" Biden.[51]

A memorandum of the call between Trump and Zelensky released by the White House on September 25, 2019

From May to August 2019, Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani pressed the Ukrainian government to investigate business activities of Hunter Biden,[52] the son of 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden,[53][54][55][56][14] who had taken a board seat on Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.[57][58] Despite the allegations, as of September 2019, there has been no evidence produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[67] The other requested investigation concerned Joe Biden, former U.S. Vice President and a candidate for the 2020 presidential election, and the Ukrainian business dealings of his son Hunter Biden.[9][2][13] At the time of the inquiry, Joe Biden was the leading candidate in Democratic Party primary polling, according to poll aggregators, making him Trump's most likely 2020 election opponent.[73] Prominent Democrats, including Senators Robert Menendez and Chris Murphy, suggested that the hold may have been intended to implicitly or explicitly pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden.[15] Former Ukrainian presidential advisor Serhiy Leshchenko said it was made a "clear fact" that Ukraine's communication with the United States was dependent on discussing a future investigation into the Bidens,[74] while another anonymous Ukrainian lawmaker stated that Trump attempted to "pressure" and "blackmail" them into accepting a "quid-pro-quo" agreement based upon cooperation.Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker had in August drafted a statement for Velensky to sign that would commit Ukraine to investigate Burisma, the company that Hunter Biden worked for, as well as the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 election to benefit Hillary Clinton."[77][78]

On September 22, shortly after the whistleblower's allegations became public, Trump acknowledged that he had discussed Joe Biden during a call with Zelensky on July 25.Trump stated that "The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating [sic] to the corruption already in Ukraine."[79] Trump denied that his hold on military aid for Ukraine was linked to the Ukrainian government's refusal to investigate the Hunter Biden controversy, while also saying that withholding aid for this reason would have been ethically acceptable if he had done it.[12]

Further revelations

President Trump states "China should start an investigation into the Bidens"; video from the White House.[87][88] On October 4, 2019, Trump held a news conference where he publicly said that Ukraine should investigate the Bidens, and also called on China to investigate the Bidens.[141] Yovanovitch testified that she had never met or spoken with Hunter Biden and that Joe Biden had never raised the subject of his son or the Ukrainian gas firm that employed him.According to The Washington Post, "In the weeks leading up to that May 23 White House briefing, Giuliani's and even Trump's interest in spotlighting the Bidens' actions in Ukraine were hardly a secret.[161] One aspect of the campaign focused on attacking Joe Biden and his son over alleged but unproven misconduct involving Ukraine.[172]

On October 3, with the impeachment inquiry ongoing, Trump told reporters that in addition to Ukraine, China should also investigate the Bidens.Zelensky says, according to the rough transcript, that his new prosecutor general “will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue” — the company Hunter Biden worked for.1: Please be sure to look into Joe Biden.Trump leaves no doubt that, in addition to relitigating the 2016 election, he wants the Ukrainians to help him win in 2020: "There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...I’m sure you will figure it out.” Trump stresses the point once more before they hang up: “I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.”

It’s true that Trump didn’t say, “If you expect to see any more aid from us, you’d better investigate Joe Biden and Clinton,” but the threat came through loud and clear, given that at least a week before, he had put a hold on nearly $400 million of aid to Ukraine.Suppose the president’s attorneys want to call Joe and Hunter Biden to testify about their activities in Ukraine.The Republican base will also likely be whipped into a frenzy by the president’s media defenders to look into the Bidens’ alleged misdeeds.The president’s counsel could ask them: “Did the president ever tell you that the aid to Ukraine would be withheld to force that country to investigate Joe Biden?” Normally, that could be considered hearsay evidence, as the answer is being presented to support the truth of the contention itself and Trump himself is not testifying to that statement.At issue is a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump is said to have brought up investigating former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 presidential opponent, and his son.Trump has denied the suggestion that he linked the disbursement of U.S. military aid to Ukraine's willingness to investigate Biden's son, saying Tuesday that he withheld the aid over a concern that European countries were not contributing enough to help support Ukraine.Trump has admitted that he asked Zelensky to probe Biden's son, who has connections to a business that was under investigation, but he denied exerting any pressure on him.Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine's largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.According to the rough transcript, Trump offered Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky help from the Justice Department to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as well as a White House meeting in exchange for the probe.Bush to Bill Clinton, and legislators ranging from Rangel to Biden to South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond to support harsh penalties for drug use and, especially, for drug dealing.The Post reports:

President Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart to work with the U.S. attorney general to investigate the conduct of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and offered to meet with the foreign leader at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry, according to a newly-released transcript of the call.Trump might have never explicitly said in so many words that there would be no aid without dirt on Biden.When Trump reminds the Ukrainian leader of the importance of U.S. aid and in the same call brings up Biden’s name, it is hard to miss the implication that Trump is tying the two together.["] Then comes the money shot: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

Zelensky promises that the next “prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate” and says “he or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.” Trump says he’ll have Giuliani and AG Barr call and says “I’m sure you will figure it out.” His closing remarks in that paragraph are chilling: “Your economy is going to get better and better I predict.As the call ends, Trump’s exit line is that he’ll “tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.”

The upshot is that the call begins with Ukraine’s president expressing the urgency of getting more United States military equipment “for defense purposes” and our president transitions immediately to saying he’d “like [Zelensky] to do us a favor though,” by which he makes clear that he is requesting help to Giuliani and Barr in going after Biden.Did Trump improperly pressure Zelensky to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, as Democrats contend?More: Read the summary of President Trump's call with Ukraine president about Biden

Here, are the most important takeaways from the memo on Trump's conversation with Zelensky:

It's not really a 'transcript'

When Trump announced he would be releasing details of the phone call, he promised a "complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript."Biden's name comes up

It's not until page four that Trump and Zelensky made a reference to Biden by name.Trump bought up the business surrounding Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who was looking into an energy company where Biden's son, Hunter Biden, served on the board of directors.Joe Biden and European allies had been pushing Ukraine to more to tackle corruption and pushed for Shokin's ouster, saying he was not doing enough to root out malfeasance.There has been no evidence Hunter Biden's relationship with the company influenced Joe Biden's actions with regard to Ukraine policy."The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great," Trump adds."Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...But as reports came out alleging that Trump had used the call to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Trump started suggesting, instead, that the complaint itself was the problem.Trump’s confidence that the Supreme Court will uphold his unbridled claims of presidential power animates his strategy of resisting congressional demands for information, including the unredacted Mueller report, his tax returns, his financial dealings with foreign leaders implicating the Constitution’s emoluments clause and most recently the whistleblower complaint apparently suggesting Trump attempted to pressure the Ukrainian president into investigating the Biden family.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images

Pelosi and House Democrats are backing an impeachment inquiry after news broke of Trump's phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he asked the newly elected president to look into former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival.On Tuesday, Trump acknowledged he ordered the aid withheld during the summer before making the July call with Zelensky, who was encouraged by Trump to work with the U.S. attorney general to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.Joe Biden; Cobie Smulders; James Blake performs.The plan under consideration from Biden's advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said.Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals.An aide to Biden confirmed that the campaign is working on tax policy proposals but would not confirm that a Wall Street tax is in the mix."[Biden] has and will continue to put forward details regarding how he will finance his biggest plans, because the stakes are too high not to be straightforward with the American people about how much they will cost and who will pay for them," Andrew Bates, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement.Tax experts said Biden's embrace of that idea would mark just how much more aggressive Democrats are now willing to be on taxes.Biden has already called for raising the tax rate paid by corporations from 21 percent to 28 percent -- the Republican tax law of 2017 lowered it from 35 percent to 21 percent -- as well as increasing the rate paid by the richest taxpayers.Biden has also proposed raising capital gains taxes on millionaires, ending incentives to move corporate profits abroad, and eliminating a loophole that allows heirs to receive capital gains tax-free, according to his campaign.In the 2016 race, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ran on a much more limited financial transaction tax than what is being considered by Biden's advisers.If Biden embraces a "Financial Transaction Tax," it is less likely to be challenged on constitutional grounds but would also be far less likely to raise as much revenue as the wealth tax, according to tax experts.The inquiry will focus, at least in part, on whether Trump abused his presidential authority and sought to help his re-election effort by asking a foreign government to help him find damaging information on Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.Trump has said he spoke by phone to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in July, where he is said to have asked for help investigating Biden and his son.Trump opponents say he was holding out the money until he got information from Zelensky on Biden.Trump’s critics are claiming that withholding the military aid until and unless an investigation into the Bidens was initiated constitutes bribery under current federal law.
