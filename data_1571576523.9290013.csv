Medical debt affects Americans who lack health insurance, of course. But it is also increasingly affecting people who have insurance with holes, like high deductibles or limited networks of doctors whose care is paid for. Around 16 percent of adults with credit reports have at least one medical debt, according to a study published last year in the journal Health Affairs.

The plan calls for the government to negotiate and cancel the debts, though it does not specify the precise mechanism.

While eliminating every American’s medical debt would probably not come cheap, Mr. Sanders’s plan could wind up costing far less than the total amount of debt he is seeking to cancel. Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt, estimated that the market price for $81 billion in debt could be as low as $500 million . Most past-due medical debt never gets paid, which is why bill collectors are often willing to sell the debts for pennies on the dollar.

The plan would also create a public credit rating agency to “replace” for-profit companies like Equifax, and it would exclude medical debts from credit ratings. It would establish a new legal process, managed by the bankruptcy court system, to help adjudicate medical debts that are not yet in collections."

Bernie Sanders Says Yes, and No",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/upshot/Bernie-Sanders-housing-plan.html,"Mr. Sanders has similarly proposed a tax on empty homes, aimed at speculators who sit on vacant properties until they become more lucrative to redevelop, or simply profitable to resell. That is a real problem in some communities, leaving neighbors to live with blight for years. But owning an empty home doesn’t necessarily make you a speculator. Someone who has put a property on the market and struggled to sell it for months might end up facing this tax.

The full proposal, emphasizing the feel-good parts of the market but not the others, is trying to have it both ways, said Jenny Schuetz, a housing economist at the Brookings Institution who has been following housing proposals from the 2020 candidates.

“In some ideal universe, people would buy homes (or rental properties) that appreciated slightly faster than inflation, allowing them to build wealth, but without housing costs rising too fast to pressure renters, deter new homeowners, or create excess capital gains,” Ms. Schuetz wrote in an email. “In that context, both rent control and flipping taxes make sense. The problem is, with any semblance of a private real estate market, land and housing values don’t behave that way.”

She is skeptical that it is even possible to design or regulate a market that gives modest returns to individual homeowners, but never gives big returns to landlords; that penalizes greedy flippers, but never harms small-time contractors; that taxes vacant homes but doesn’t punish working families.

Mr. Sanders’s ideas invite a host of questions about how they would technically work (how do we police a million landlords?) and where their legal authority would come from (would the courts uphold a national rent control law?). But these deeper questions about the kind of housing market voters might want seem worth hashing out, regardless of those other details.

Mr. Orton, the Sanders adviser, pushed back against the logic of economists that, for one, rent control discourages developers from building and landlords from renting housing that Americans badly need.

“I would say to those economists, how is that working out?” he said of the current deference to the market. “That’s what we’ve been doing. When we’ve left this to private developers, everything from the crash of the housing market to how we’ve seen gentrification just explode in some of the most vulnerable communities, to how we’ve seen people priced out of what would normally be affordable housing — this current crisis is the result of that.”"

Another Texas Southern student, Christopher Anwuri, 22, said the generational differences in how black voters saw the primary were fueled by opposing theories of political change: incrementalism versus immediate upheaval.

“This generation is looking for an instant, quick fix for problems,” he said. Older black people, meanwhile, think “these things need to take time.”

It also comes back to Mr. Obama, and the long shadow he casts over national Democratic politics, particularly in black communities. Older black voters invoke his name in deference, and cite his embrace of Mr. Biden as something that helped him win the trust of skeptical white voters in 2008.

To younger generations, many of whom were in high school or younger at the time, Mr. Obama’s achievements exist on their own. Their first memories of Mr. Biden stem from his highly meme-able vice-presidential years. They are also more likely to hold his long and at times controversial record — on criminal justice, school segregation and the Clarence Thomas hearings, among other things — against him.

Jayla Lee, 19, said older black voters “like Biden because he was with Obama, and they feel like since they could trust Obama that means they can trust him.”

“But the things we endure are not the things they endured,” Ms. Lee said. “And I’m looking for someone who can change the things that affect me.”"

Mr. Biden, whose appearances on the campaign trail can be halting and sprinkled with misstatements, has generally delivered his strongest performances when focused on Mr. Trump. Speaking about the president allows Mr. Biden to discuss foreign policy and national security, issues that his campaign has said differentiate Mr. Biden, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, from the rest of the 2020 Democratic field.

While Mr. Trump’s attacks give Mr. Biden the one-on-one showdown with the president that his campaign has spent months trying to create, it also exposes him and his son to another round of questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities in Ukraine.

The Biden campaign moved quickly to warn the news media over the story, underscoring a deep concern about how allegations about the younger Mr. Biden’s work will be received by voters. “Any article, segment analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump’s claim, and in fact that they are wholly discredited, is misleading readers and viewers ,” said the deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in an email to reporters.

But Biden advisers also seized on the furor to portray Mr. Trump as fixated on, and worried about, a potential general election race against Mr. Biden.

“There is only one candidate the president is trying to get foreign governments to dig up bogus dirt on,” Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, said.

The effort by the president and his team to shift the focus to Mr. Biden could boomerang, casting the Democratic front-runner as a sympathetic figure unfairly attacked with foreign help. It could just as easily mark a defining moment for Mr. Biden, a 76-year-old politician first elected to the Senate in 1972 and long accustomed to playing by the more genteel political rules of a different era."

Campaign flagging? Reboot it. Strategy not working? Reset it. Running for president in a crowded field of Democrats and desperate for attention? Flip your campaign upside down and tell the world you’re starting over.

With so many Democrats angling for a breakout moment in the party’s presidential primary, reboots, resets, and rethinks have become as much a part of the race as arguing over health-care policy. Here’s a look back at all of the 2020 Democratic candidates’ attempts to change course.

Kamala Harris

The latest candidate to shake things up is California senator Harris. Late Wednesday, Politico reported that Harris is “putting her stumbling campaign on the line with a new Iowa-or-bust strategy.” She’s turning her attention away from high-dollar fundraisers and toward the folks on the prairie who, in four short months, could decide her fate. That means doubling her 65-person staff in Iowa and making weekly visits to the state she hasn’t touched down in since August. As she joked to Hawaii senator Mazie Hirono on Wednesday, “I’m fucking moving to Iowa.”

This isn’t even the first reboot for Harris, who in May attempted to “reset her campaign after stagnating in Democratic-primary polls, using her strengths as a prosecutor … to mount a sharp indictment of Mr. Trump,” the Times reported.

Joe Biden

For a guy who has been atop the polls since the moment he entered the race, Biden has seen more than his fair share of reboots. Following the first debate, and in the face of mounting criticism of his record on issues including busing and working with segregationists, Biden sought a “reboot” that Axios called the “wrap the bow” strategy. The idea was to deflect any criticism on issues regarding race by saying something like “If I was good enough for Obama, then I can’t be all bad.”

Several weeks later, ahead of the second Democratic debate, Senator Jack Reed told the Washington Examiner that Biden was “reconfiguring” his campaign. The plan? Start attacking rivals head-on. Presumably, this is why Biden said of Elizabeth Warren in the third debate, “I know that the senator says she’s for Bernie. Well, I’m for Barack. I think Obamacare worked.”

Cory Booker

Any moment now, Booker is going to have his breakout moment in the Democratic primary. Any. Moment. Now. Frustrated with his standing as a second-tier candidate, Booker sought a shake-up back in April. That’s when he launched a two-week national tour. Politico described it as a “new phase designed to sharpen his message and distinguish himself from the pack.” The tour also served as an acknowledgement that his “message of love and unity” had fallen flat. So it was time to reboot.

Pete Buttigieg

The South Bend mayor’s out-of-nowhere success might suggest that he needs to change nothing. But even wunderkinds need resets. Buttigieg’s came in late August when it became clear that after raising gobs of money, he also needed to get to work on the ground. So his campaign entered what his senior adviser Lis Smith called “phase three:” “Blow them out of the water with our organization and our organizational abilities.” It seems that means working to catch up to other campaigns in early caucus and primary states, and hiring a black outreach director.

Beto O’Rourke

No candidate has rebooted more than O’Rourke, who been trying for months to recapture the acclaim he won when he launched. In May, he tried to “reinvigorate” his campaign, the Washington Post reported, with an appearance on The View and an acknowledgement of his privilege. Up until that point, he’d shunned national TV in favor of standing on bar tops and diner counters to talk to voters.

That new strategy lasted about two months. By late July, after his lackluster showing in the first debate, O’Rourke’s aides told Yahoo News he was planning to reintroduce himself at the second debate by “trying to achieve a delicate balance, coming across forcefully without seeming overly aggressive.”

Then, in early August, a gunman went on a rampage in El Paso, O’Rourke’s hometown. The candidate spent nearly two weeks off the campaign trail and emerged with yet another new strategy: a campaign focused on gun control. The late-August shooting spree in West Texas further solidified the strategy, which had come to include a new catchphrase: “This is fucked up.” He followed this with a declaration in the third debate, “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” drawing criticism from Republicans and some Democrats who think the line may make it harder to pass bipartisan gun legislation.

Bernie Sanders

With perhaps the most die-hard fan base of any of the Democrats, it stands to reason that Sanders would just need to keep on doing what he’s doing. But in late May, he unveiled what CNN called a “new strategy”: He started taking selfies after campaign events. Then in August, Politico reported that the “stalled Sanders campaign orchestrated [a] reboot” with “a renewed focus” on Medicare for All.

Elizabeth Warren

The Massachusetts senator caused trouble for herself several months before she even launched her campaign with an ill-considered DNA test meant to address the questions around her claims of Native American ancestry. By the time she launched her campaign, it was itself seen as a reboot of her image, or as the Post put it, a chance to “reset the conversation about her candidacy and refocus it on her message of bolstering the middle class.”"

Another week, another town hall about climate change.

MSNBC kicked off its televised climate forum for 2020 presidential candidates at Georgetown University on Thursday, inviting a dozen White House hopefuls to sit down and answer questions from moderators and college students ahead of a major youth climate march on Friday. The two-day event comes just two weeks after one of MSNBC's rivals, CNN, staged its own seven-hour-long climate forum.

The candidates didn't deviate much from what they've said in past campaign speeches and during previous debates. But there were a few thing that caught the Energy 202's eye:

Bernie Sanders and fossil-fuel jobs: The Vermont senator acknowledged to MSNBC host Chris Hayes that his ambitious plan to end the use of fossil fuels will lead to the loss of jobs in the oil, gas and coal sectors.

What he said: ""I’m not going to say Chris, you know if you want to press the point, that there aren’t people who will be hurt. I got that. And it doesn’t make me happy.""

""I’m not going to say Chris, you know if you want to press the point, that there aren’t people who will be hurt. I got that. And it doesn’t make me happy."" Why it matters: For a candidate who likes to call himself the most ""pro-worker"" member of Congress, any potential pink slips are a weak spot in pitching his $16.3 trillion Green New Deal. But Sanders added that transitioning to a cleaner economy will create ""up to 20 million good paying jobs."" His climate plan also recognizes the issue too, offering five years of unemployment insurance and other benefits to laid-off oil field workers, coal miners and other laborers.

Andrew Yang and GDP: The tech entrepreneur made his pitch for reforming the way gross domestic product, or GDP, is calculated.

What he said: ""As your president, I'm just going to go down the street to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and say: Hey. GDP. A hundred years old. Kind of out of date. Let's modernize it.""

""As your president, I'm just going to go down the street to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and say: Hey. GDP. A hundred years old. Kind of out of date. Let's modernize it."" Why it matters: The oft-cited statistic is supposed to track a nation's entire economic output. But an increasing number of left-leaning economists and other thinkers — including Yang — say it falls short as a measure of well-being since it does not properly take into account damage to the environment.

John Delaney and emergency powers: The former Maryland congressman suggested he would consider invoking emergency powers as president to tackle climate change.

What he said: ""I would use every single executive authority I could possibly muster, including considering a national emergency, to get this done ... That's how important I think this is.""

""I would use every single executive authority I could possibly muster, including considering a national emergency, to get this done ... That's how important I think this is."" Why it matters: Delaney is not the only candidate to suggest using an emergency declaration to fund emissions-reduction efforts should Congress fail to pass climate legislation with the next Democratic president. So have Sanders and financier Tom Steyer. But the fact that a self-described moderate like Delaney would consider taking that step suggests the idea is gaining traction with elected Democrats. Delaney, though, did go on to note that the only way to make ""enduring change"" is by passing laws.

Marianne Williamson and national service: The author and activist told students listening at Georgetown she wants to compel their age group into serving in a climate-related national service program.

What she said: ""I'm going to ask all of you. Maybe not all of you. I would like to ask you your opinion. I think during this season of repair we should have a mandatory national service — one year — for people between the ages of 18 and 26, because we need you. We need to fix this climate.""

I think during this season of repair we should have a mandatory national service — one year — for people between the ages of 18 and 26, because we need you. We need to fix this climate."" Why it matters: The idea of a ""climate corps"" — something akin to the Peace Corps launched in 1961 by John F. Kennedy — has been suggested by other candidates, such as Delaney and Cory Booker, as a way of preparing communities for the effects of climate change and responding to natural disasters. But none of the other White House hopefuls are asking for mandatory service.

— “This is not a regular meeting of the U.N.”: Ahead of Monday’s much-anticipated climate summit at the United Nations in New York, the U.N. Secretary General António Guterres has traversed the globe urging leaders to urgently seek solutions to climate change. The summit will be a test of whether that message has seeped through, The Post’s Brady Dennis and Steven Mufson report.

Who is speaking : U.N. officials said only nations with meaningful new climate pledges will be able to speak. Guterres has asked countries attending to bring “promises of tangible action, such as vowing to reach net zero emissions by 2050, scaling back fossil fuel subsidies and halting construction of new coal-fired power plants.”

— Amazon signs on to climate pledge: Jeff Bezos announced Amazon is the first to sign a “Climate Pledge,” a pact the company has crafted to meet the Paris climate agreement goals 10 years ahead of schedule.

What it does : “Speaking in Washington with former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, Bezos said the agreement would require signatories to measure and report their emissions on a regular basis,” The Post’s Rachel Siegel and Jay Greene report. “The pledge would require companies to implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris agreement and calls on signatories to be at net zero carbon across their businesses by 2040. Any remaining carbon emissions would be neutralized with quantifiable and permanent offsets to achieve the pledge’s goal.”

— 3 billion birds gone: North America's bird population dropped by 29 percent in the last 50 years, according to a new study from top ornithologists and government agencies who called the loss an “overlooked biodiversity crisis.”

“This is not an extinction crisis — yet,” The Post’s Karin Bruilliard reports. “It is a more insidious decline in abundance as humans dramatically alter the landscape: There are 29 percent fewer birds in the United States and Canada today than in 1970, the study concludes.”

The Post’s Karin Bruilliard reports. “It is a more insidious decline in abundance as humans dramatically alter the landscape: There are 29 percent fewer birds in the United States and Canada today than in 1970, the study concludes.” The causes: It's ""death by a thousand cuts,"" according to lead study author Ken Rosenberg. The primary drivers are agriculture and habitat loss, with other factors like light pollution (which disorients them), buildings (which they crash into) and cats (which eat them) contributing.

— EPA pushes back on an E&E News investigation: A recent, deeply reported story from E&E News found EPA chief of staff Ryan Jackson has intervened numerous times in the agency’s environmental enforcement process. In one case, he helped fix a $100,000 problem for a fellow Oklahoma Republican whose client was accused of emitting smog-forming pollution.

“Jackson's previously unreported role as an enforcement fixer for friends and allies — pieced together from internal agency records, enforcement documents, company financial filings and interviews — makes some former career EPA enforcement staffers question whether Jackson is abusing his powerful position to benefit favored companies and lobbyists,” E&E News reports.

The pushback: Jackson and another EPA official told the publication that it wasn’t a problem for him or any political appointee to get involved in such cases. “A chief of staff has specific responsibilities, but broader responsibilities to ensure a variety of things get completed, addressed, and worked out,” Jackson said. In a series of tweets from the agency’s main account, the EPA said the story was “full of more inaccurate innuendo than EPA has time to correct.” It also resurfaced a press release from February in which it called another E&E News story “hogwash.”

— The U.S. is less susceptible than before to oil price shocks: Fuel prices in the United States could still climb in the coming weeks if Saudi Arabia’s oil production doesn’t rebound after the weekend’s attacks on key oil facilities. “But these days the United States isn’t quite as vulnerable to oil price shocks,” The Post’s Jeanne Whalen writes, adding previous disruptions to oil exports in the Middle East had a larger impact on U.S. fuel prices. “A decade-long boom in domestic extraction has turned the United States into the world’s largest oil producer, a position that will cushion the economy in new ways, economists and energy experts say.”

— The latest on Tropical Storm Imelda: The storm drenching major metropolitan areas in Texas is already the fifth wettest tropical cyclone to ever hit the Lower 48 states. “Roughly two feet of rain has engulfed parts of this vast, highly populated area since Wednesday morning, while some areas have seen over three feet,” The Post’s Matthew Cappucci, Andrew Freedman and Jason Samenow report. “More than 1,000 high water rescues were conducted in Harris County alone, according to the county’s fire marshal.” The storm has left at least two people dead as the heavy down pour “shut down major roadways, triggered hundreds of calls for help and invited comparisons to Hurricane Harvey of 2017 as Gov. Greg Abbott (R) declared a state of emergency for portions of the state,” The Post’s Brittney Martin, Brittany Shammas and Hannah Knowles report.

— The biggest Arctic expedition in history: The German icebreaker RV Polarstern is about to set sail with scores of scientists and researchers hoping to understand how climate change is impacting the North Pole, The Post’s Sarah Kaplan reports. It’s an at least $134 million project that’s been in the works for a decade. “As winter darkness descends on the Arctic, the adventurers will allow the sea to freeze around their vessel, trapping them. The Polarstern will spend the next 12 months drifting slowly across the pole, as scientists collect crucial observations on the water, the ice, the air and the living inhabitants, until summer melting finally sets the ship free,” she writes.

In New York City and around the world, millions of people took to the streets on Friday morning. A single demand unified them: Leaders must act, and act now, to stop climate change from getting any worse. “I want you to unite behind science. And then I want you to take real action. Thank you,” Greta Thunberg, the teen climate-change activist from Sweden, told Congress on Wednesday.

And a growing number of climate-change activists have coalesced around an answer to this imperative, a Green New Deal. The proposal, which would transition the U.S. economy to clean energy and create millions of new jobs, has become a rallying cry for organizations like the Sunrise Movement and left-wing Democrats like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Although Ocasio-Cortez helped popularize the Green New Deal, and so has her fellow congressional democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the basic concept is at least 12 years old. Not long after New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman called for a “Green New Deal” in 2007, a group of British academics and activists began drafting a substantive proposal that was published in July 2008.

Ann Pettifor, the director of policy research in macroeconomics and an honorary fellow at City, University of London, contributed to that early report. She’s also credited as one of the first economists to predict the financial crisis of 2008.

In her new book, The Case for the Green New Deal, Pettifor argues that the U.S. can, in fact, afford the Green New Deal — and far more easily than it can afford the consequences of unchecked climate change. She imagines a greener and more peaceful future. In a decarbonized economy, she writes, “we will do far more walking and cycling; we will not fly; we will give up meat and grow and consume local, seasonal, slow food. We will make and repair our own garments, rather than exploiting low-paid workers in far-off places.”

This interview has been edited for clarity and shortened for length. The Case for the Green New Deal is forthcoming from Verso Books on October 8.

Why do you think it has taken this long for the Green New Deal to catch fire in the public imagination?

For several reasons. Really, it takes an American, doesn’t it? I mean, when the Americans decide something is important, then it suddenly becomes important, and that’s fantastic. But I think what happened back in 2008 was that we were going through this grim financial crisis and London was at the heart of it already thanks to the City of London. We were writing [the British Green New Deal] after the date that I called Detonation Day — on the ninth of August 2007, when interbank lending froze and the system blew up.

Then in October 2008, with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the whole thing becomes real for millions of people. Then it became quite hard to push the green story. The climate-breakdown story just wasn’t sexy at that point. Over the years, it has been picked up by various people; Jill Stein in the United States began to campaign on it. But on the whole it remained in the margins until Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year decided to make it part of her pitch. We owe everything to these Justice Democrats for lifting this issue way up into the stratosphere. It’s really been important, the role they play.

How would you say Ocasio-Cortez, the Justice Democrats, and the Sunrise Movement have changed the fight for a Green New Deal globally?

It’s quite extraordinary. Ocasio-Cortez was a David taking on Goliath, taking on Joe Crowley, one of the really big heavyweights in the Democratic Party. It was a huge achievement. And it was her profile that helped project the Green New Deal into the public domain. But it was also a steady, long, continuous process that’s being done by groups like the Sunrise Movement, going to Congress and standing outside Nancy Pelosi’s office at what I thought was just a pivotal moment.

You explain in your book that the U.K. version of the Green New Deal is a little different from the U.S. version. One way the two differ is that, as you put it, the U.K. plan emphasizes internationalism more. Tell me what you mean by that.

When I stress that we looked at it from an international perspective [in the U.K.], it was because we were looking at the financial system, and the financial system is globalized. It operates in the stratosphere. It operates out there beyond the reach of elected governments. And that’s important to us because we don’t believe it’s possible to finance the things we want without doing something about those guys out there who are effectively the masters of the universe. They’re why Alan Greenspan said back in the day that it doesn’t really matter who you elect president because actually the markets make all the decisions.

It’s those speculators and those testosterone-driven financiers in the markets who are effectively governing our economies. And so I think we stress that aspect of it because it affects those of us who are not Americans, who don’t have the world’s reserve currency at our disposal.

How would the Green New Deal ideally change the U.S.’s posture to the rest of the world?

That’s a really big question because one of the points I make in the book is that the dollar is all-powerful. We’ve dollarized the global economy, and that enables the United States, for example, to strut around the world, kicking people around, because the United States government and Americans have access to the world’s currency. This is a bit like being the banker in a game of Monopoly, and that privileges the United States.

In the past, Britain issued the world’s reserve currency. Sterling was the great imperial power and the great currency. We were defeated, and we had to concede that role to the United States. But it makes a very big difference to (a) the way in which an economy is managed and (b) the way people’s attitudes are when they are the beneficiaries of the world’s reserve currency.

I think it might also drive the United States away from the attitude of Trump, from being the world’s policemen, and turn the United States into a cooperator with the rest of the world. That’s what’s going to have to happen under the Green New Deal; we’re going to have to work together. And the United States is going to have to work with others in order for there not to be storms that rip up Florida and the East Coast. So I think it may make the United States more internationalist and a more cooperative state so we could create a stable ecosystem as well as a stable global economy. That would be very helpful. That was the role the United States played after the Second World War, and I would be very happy if they would play that role again as part of the Green New Deal.

Several white nationalists, in the U.S. and elsewhere, have expressed a form of ecofascism as justification for a mass shooting. Do you think a Green New Deal could be one solution to this nascent authoritarianism?

I think there are lots of reasons America has mass shooters. But to me, quite a lot of the insurgency we’re seeing in the United States and around the world is about the fact that people feel threatened. They’ve lost their jobs. And if they haven’t lost their jobs, they’ve lost income. Their children are finding it difficult to get a roof over their heads. Their kids can’t get to college. And even if they do get to college, it’s incredibly expensive, and they become incredibly indebted.

What the New Deal did, what Roosevelt did by creating jobs, by creating prosperity, by restoring, if you like, economic security to the American people, also engendered a more community-oriented society. It wasn’t necessary to go around killing people. It wasn’t necessary to resort to violence and authoritarianism. I think we’re getting this resort to violence and authoritarianism because people are asking to be protected from what they see as out-of-control markets. I’m hoping that the Green New Deal will offer that protection, that it will actually be much more economically just. We’ll get economic security because it will create millions of well-paying, highly skilled jobs. And that would restore equity in American society.

And perhaps it might become more difficult for strongmen to scapegoat immigrants.

Yes, the whole of the 1930s was about scapegoating Jews. But the 1930s was also about the gold standard and economic instability and economic insecurity and austerity and unemployment and low wages. Just a deep sense of anger and injustice. And as Karl Polanyi has argued, people were demanding to be protected from those out-of-control market forces. Authoritarian leaders blame immigrants and make things worse for themselves as well as for the economy. Europe turned toward strongmen. But Roosevelt and the Americans turned to democracy, turned toward an economy that was one in which the government was in the driving seat.

And that transformation, for me, is so huge. Roosevelt subordinated the interests of Wall Street to the interests of the American people. On the night of his inauguration, he began to dismantle the global financial system, which was governed by private authority, by Wall Street, and by the City of London. He said you are not going to decide the value of the dollar; the democratic government is going to decide. And by assigning the value of the dollar, we’re going to reset the prices farmers are paying for their goods and their products. In that way, we’re going to restore some stability to our economy and to our people.

How damaging has austerity been to the fight against climate change?

Well, that comes back to the story of what happened in 2007 and 2008. It was incredibly damaging, and it was intentionally so. What happened was, in 2007, you have a financial system that breaks down. Full stop. Where is the left? Where are the Democrats? Where is the Labour Party? Where are the socialists saying we know what can be done to fix it? There was silence. Obama was stunned. He didn’t really know what to do. He turned to bankers to solve the problem. In Britain, we turned to the City of London to help us fix the system. It was only too happy to do that: Let’s fix this system so we are even better off! We can become bigger and better than we were before the crisis! And the left was silent. That turned us toward austerity. It worsened inequality, it lowered wages across the world, and the rich got richer. The one percent couldn’t believe their luck. The banks were too big to fail, and they were far too big to jail.

So they come out of the crisis triumphant, and in that process, people were really pressed hard, really trodden down by austerity. Jobs were lost, wages were falling. Debt rose, and students became heavily indebted. What austerity did was make it harder to mobilize the left; it made it harder to mobilize ordinary young people. People were too bothered with getting by on a day-to-day basis, so big issues like the climate and, indeed, the economy were hardly raised.

I’m from an area of the U.S. that has depended heavily on coal mining for economic stability. The mining jobs are petering out, and they’re probably not going to come back. I can see how a Green New Deal would bring jobs back to the area, but it’s still such a tough sell sometimes. So I’m curious: What would a just transition look like in these communities, and how can we communicate about the Green New Deal in a persuasive way?

I think first of all we have to say a green transition has to be a labor-intensive transition. We have to substitute labor for oil, for coal. So whereas before we drove around in vehicles powered by fossil fuels, we’re not going to do that in the future. And what that means is we are going to do a lot more cycling, for a start. We’re going to have to find other ways of moving around that are not fossil-fuel dependent. For that to happen, I really believe we’re going to have to invent new forms of transport. We’re going to have to build a new kind of infrastructure, and it’s going to require an enormous amount of labor.

I think we’re going to find that without fossil fuels, without the cement and the steel and all of that, there’s going to be much more work for us to do. And that’s going to enrich coal communities. I’m convinced of that.

I think it’s going to be as if we were going to war. During the war here in Britain, we had to learn to be more self-sufficient in the way we operated. We had to grow our own food. We occupied the great aristocratic houses of Britain to turn them into hospitals and other community services. Those who survived the war were better off, and they found that they were healthier, that their diets were healthier, and that they had a stronger sense of community. After that, we got our National Health Service, and we got all kinds of institutions that helped societies come together. So I think there’s quite a lot of hope.

In the U.S., whenever people on the left propose a redistribution of resources, they’re greeted with the same question: How are you going to pay for that? It’s clear in your book that you think this is a disingenuous question, but can you briefly explain why?

First of all, the question of how do we pay for subsidies to Boeing is never a matter of debate in the U.S. Congress. Or subsidies to the military. How do we pay for that? We never talk about that. We assume rightly that the monetary system works with the fiscal system to finance the payments. But Medicare? Suddenly we have to ask how do we pay for it. As for how do you pay for the Green New Deal, the way we pay for it is not difficult.

The first source is credit. And as you know from the way you use your credit card, there’s no money in the bag when you spend on your credit. You haven’t put a bunch of savings into that account before you spend. Your credit card, for example, is a promise to pay. During the Second World War, the commercial banks were obliged in Britain to lend money to the government. They did, it was called Treasury deposit receipts, and it helped to finance government expenditure. But also the government used credit from the central banks — and in the United States, the Federal Reserve — to help finance its spending. I don’t believe in direct, on-its-face financing of government spending, but the government issues bonds and the Federal Reserve buys those bonds and by doing that it helps to keep interest rates low and helps to finance the government’s spending

The other source of financing is already-existing savings. So savings only exist as a consequence of investments. It’s like if I borrowed money to go to build a house: I build the house, I sell the house, I make a profit, and I move out of my house. And we know this world is actually awash with savings at the moment, mainly because too much credit has been issued rather recklessly. So we’ve got a lot of savings, and the government can draw on the world savings.

The Green New Deal will not use credit and savings for the purposes of speculation. They would be used for the purpose of creating jobs. And the wonderful thing about jobs and employment is that, as you and I know from our own experience, when you get a job, you go in at the beginning of the month and, at the end of the month, you get a paycheck. Jobs create income. But they don’t just create income for you. They generate tax revenues for governments as well.

I was chuffed when I saw that Bernie Sanders has got a 16 trillion-dollar plan. And when they asked him how we were going to pay for it, he said it would pay for itself over the next 15 years. What he means is they will raise 16 trillion dollars either by credit or via savings. The employees will get income and pay taxes, and that can be used to pay for the borrowing. In that sense, employment creation does pay for itself.

It’s very clear in your book that you believe there’s a need to take away the power we have vested in finance and markets and restore it to the people, to a political process. We’ve done that in the past, and it has been reversed. How do we do this in the future and make sure it’s permanent?

One way is to stop taking the Chicago School Kool-Aid, which argues that these guys are just brilliant entrepreneurs and they do it all themselves. That is just not the case. Private financing is heavily dependent on the public sector. And the thing they want most, for example, is government assets, and that is government debt. U.S. government debt is a wonderful, valuable asset. Why? Because it generates interest over time. Because this is very safe. Everybody knows the American public has never defaulted paying out its interest payments or repaying its debt. And why? Because the American people pay their taxes.

We pay our taxes, and that generates revenue for anyone who buys a U.S. government bond. They would not have that asset and that income without law-abiding taxpayers. We need to understand that private finance, Wall Street, depends on the public sector. But it also drains the public sector, if you like. We need to understand that we have that leverage and we could withhold that leverage. We could say, Sorry, but if you want to buy government debt, these are the terms and conditions. I want us to get more confident about understanding the way the system works and more confident that we don’t have to give away this valuable stuff that we’ve produced by being law-abiding, taxpaying citizens."
14,Paul Waldman,"Elizabeth Warrens free ride is coming to an end.
Okay, its something of an exaggeration to say shes had a free ride. But its certainly true that up until now, the Massachusetts senator hasnt had to worry about attacks from her Democratic presidential primary… [+5645 chars]","With her campaign gaining momentum, we're about to find out.",2019-09-20,The Washington Post,Can Elizabeth Warren take the heat?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/20/can-elizabeth-warren-take-heat/,"And Warren’s press coverage of late has been overwhelmingly positive. Even the criticisms of her from Republicans have seemed almost halfhearted.

Now that she’s looking like she has a good chance to be the Democratic nominee for president, all that is going to change. Is she ready?

AD

Candidates often aren’t; they frequently seem surprised when some initial success turns them into a target. If there’s anyone you’d expect to be prepared, it would be Warren, who is nothing if not a meticulous planner. If she was smart, when designing her campaign she would have considered the moment when controversy arises and everyone starts attacking her, and come up with a strategy to deal with it.

AD

She isn’t facing that moment quite yet, but the first glimmers are appearing. We began to see it a couple of weeks ago, when staffers and supporters of other Democratic candidates began criticizing her, arguing either that the only true progressive champion in the race is Sanders or that her ambitious plans are too pie-in-the-sky to pass Congress.

And now, other candidates themselves are dipping toes in that water. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg called her “evasive” for not addressing how much taxes might have to increase to fund Medicare-for-all. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said, “We’ve got a lot of great people running, but some of these ideas are better left in the college faculty lounge,” a clear reference to Warren, the only former college professor in the race.

AD

That’s obviously mild stuff. But the change is still notable, because it’s not until you begin to define the shape of the race that other candidates seek to define themselves in opposition to you.

AD

The tone of Warren’s press coverage will change at some point, too. When she was in single digits, she wasn’t getting much coverage at all, but when she began rising in the polls and attracting huge crowds, the coverage not only increased but also became largely positive, as reporters wrote stories explaining her success. That’s still going on; here, for instance, is an episode of the New York Times podcast “The Daily” that goes deep inside everything that happens at a Warren rally, with predictably glowing results.

To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with that kind of positive coverage. Explaining how a campaign works and why it is gaining supporters is worthwhile journalism. And there’s almost no way to write about, for instance, Warren’s almost inhuman ability to spend hours with supporters in a way that doesn’t reflect well on her.

AD

But the press is a restless beast. There will inevitably come a time when reporters start thinking, even subconsciously, “enough of the love-fest. Let’s find the ugly side of this candidate.” When they get passed opposition research by her opponents, they’ll take more interest in it. As criticism of her mounts, that criticism will seem like more of a story in itself and get more prominent play. Don’t forget that there is probably no more powerful bias in the media than the bias toward conflict.

AD

Which, depending on how it’s reported, is also fine. For instance, Warren and Biden have serious differences in both policy ideas and basic philosophy, and they have a history of conflict that goes back to a bankruptcy bill that Biden championed in 2005. If some voters are choosing between them, those disagreements offer helpful information.

Then there’s President Trump and other Republicans. Despite the fact that Trump has long used a racist slur to refer to her, the full power of the right’s apparatus of character assassination hasn’t been turned on her yet.

AD

How will she react to all that? There’s no way to know yet. But my impression is that she has changed her approach. At the beginning of Trump’s presidency, she was eager to engage him directly in as pugnacious a manner as possible, to demonstrate that she could go toe-to-toe with him. It culminated in her decision to respond to his attacks by taking a DNA test to establish that she had Native ancestry, a mistake that she has probably learned from.

AD

Lately you can detect something different in Warren: She’s as critical of Trump as the rest of the candidates, but she’s not trying to get in the muck with him and argue on the terms he sets. This is part of a wider realization on Democrats’ part, that taking his bait to get into juvenile squabbles only serves his purposes.

That’s one of the keys to handling attacks: knowing what has to be engaged and what you can, and should, just ignore. Warren, and any other candidate, might take a lesson from Barack Obama, whose “No Drama Obama” philosophy in 2008 was all about sticking to his strategy, rather than getting caught up in the frenzied news cycle and sidetracked by microcontroversies everyone would quickly forget about anyway.

AD

Notwithstanding a few relatively polite disagreements in debates, the entire Democratic primary has been extremely friendly. But it’s not going to stay that way, and given who the incumbent is, the general election may be the ugliest we’ve seen in our lifetimes. Warren’s mantra is “I’ve got a plan for that.” We’ll she if she does.

The effort comes amid widespread conversations in the party about how to win white, working-class voters in Upper Midwestern states that tipped the 2016 election to President Trump. It also comes amid a heavy focus on the first two Democratic primary states, Iowa and New Hampshire.

The intent of the letter, the mayors said, is to bring attention to the needs of urban centers in the South that often feel overlooked.

“We’ve got something to say,” said Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. “We weigh in because the national conversation is often removed from what we represent.”

It could also serve to nudge the leading candidates in the polls to try to expand their agendas, as well as the bases of support they are building. Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are in competition for many white, working-class voters, although Biden also has a strong base of African American support, polls show. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s base tends to be whiter and more affluent.

The letter seeks detailed agendas on affordable housing, infrastructure, criminal justice reform, food policy and other issues. The mayors tell the candidates they represent 345,000 voters, “and importantly, 196 Democratic delegates in 2020 from the states our cities serve.”

It adds: “This letter will serve as a roadmap for your campaigns to engage with us if you wish to seek any of our individual endorsements.”

While some of the candidates have released policy proposals on the topics the letter outlines, the mayors said they would like to see a bigger conversation around them, including in televised debates.

“I do worry that the conversations have not been in depth and substantive enough in the issues articulated in the letter,” said Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia.

After the first two nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, both heavily white, states, the primary battle will shift to more geographically and ethnically diverse terrain, starting with Nevada and South Carolina. On Super Tuesday in early March, Alabama and Arkansas will be among the states casting ballots.

Southern state primaries, in which African American voters play a significant role, hold the potential to tilt the outcome of the race toward or away from candidates. In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s strong showing in the South helped propel her to victory over Sanders.

Beyond the primaries, Democrats have begun thinking about areas in the South as places to expand the map in federal elections. Shifting demographics have made Democrats more optimistic about competing in Georgia, a state the party has talked about turning blue in the near future. Competing for votes in the South now could lay a foundation that could pay dividends down the road, the mayors said.

The mayors, who have spoken to many of the candidates, said that while their endorsement decisions will be shaped by responses to the letter, they intend to decide them individually. And they want their choices to matter.

“We don't want to be an afterthought,” said Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba. “Just like anybody else, we want to be represented.”

The pivot comes as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) continues to rise nationally and as Harris — and other candidates — struggle to dent the strength of former vice president Joe Biden in the polls. Many Democrats believed his support would start to fade, and his continued strength is leaving less room for other candidates to elbow their way into contention, forcing some to reconsider their approach.

Harris’s moves also come at a critical moment in the campaign calendar. Less than five months remain until voting begins — not much time for an assault on the commanding position of Biden, Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.). The third-quarter fundraising period ends Sept. 30, and a weak showing could damage several of the hopefuls.

For Harris, the renewed Iowa focus suggests her strategists, who once felt she had many paths to the nomination, are seeing those options dwindle. South Carolina, for example, was initially viewed as a promising target for Harris, who could then use her momentum to vault into the rest of the primary season. But Biden holds a persistent lead in the state, where he benefits from the loyalty of many black voters.

Harris’s plan for frequent Iowa appearances will not preclude efforts in South Carolina, where she will also campaign this weekend. But it does represent a major pivot for Harris, who spent most of the last months crisscrossing the country to big-dollar fundraisers to the exclusion of more regular campaigning.

Although her campaign was the first to buy television ads in Iowa and she staged a five-day bus tour there in August, Harris had not campaigned in Iowa in five weeks as of Thursday morning — a longer drought than any of the leading candidates.

Harris, a senator from California, has also been scarce recently in other early primary states like New Hampshire, where she’s appeared once in the last two months, and South Carolina, which she has not visited in more than two months.

AD

Rodriguez said those omissions were strategic. The campaign, he said, believed the candidate should be fundraising rather than retail politicking so she could build the necessary resources to spread her message in Iowa and other early states.

AD

But Harris has struggled to turn her attention-grabbing campaign launch into consistent momentum. Early on, campaign staff and advisers argued that her main problem was name identification, since fewer people knew her than Biden, Sanders or Warren. As soon as she got herself out on the campaign trail, they said, she’d catch up in the polls.

But Harris has not been in front of early-state voters as much as the other candidates. And now Harris’s donors are increasingly concerned about her prospects, while the campaign is seeking to dampen expectations for fundraising in the year’s third quarter.

AD

“She has consistently been in the top four or five [in the polls], but with the acknowledgment that we’ve got to get her out there more,” said Harris communications director Lily Adams. “That’s the purpose of getting her out there in October, spending half the month or so in Iowa, making sure we’re there every week.”

AD

Still, a top-three finish in Iowa — let alone a nationwide comeback — will not come easily. An Iowa poll released this week, conducted by longtime Harris pollster David Binder for Focus on Rural America, found Harris at five percent in the state, trailing not only Biden, Warren and Sanders but also South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

The poll showed Harris slipping 13 points from where she stood after staging an emotional attack on Biden in the first Democratic debate, after which Harris described herself as a “top-tier” candidate.

AD

Asked on Thursday about that drop in polls, Adams said the campaign never believed the earlier polling spike would last, referring to it as “a sugar high.”

But the unspoken challenge — for Harris as well as other Democrats — is Biden’s durability, as Harris advisers and allies acknowledge privately. Despite attacks from his rivals, multiple gaffes and questions about his age and record, Biden has maintained his spot atop virtually all state and national polls.

AD

Harris’s advisers have long seen Biden as the rival she needs to beat, particularly when it comes to African American voters. But so far, she been unable to dislodge or put a visible dent in Biden’s prospects in Iowa, South Carolina or elsewhere.

AD

Her campaign has demonstrated a belief — as evidenced in part by her strategy in the first two debates — that Harris can pry voters away from the former vice president, particularly if he falters. If he doesn’t, she will not be the only 2020 hopeful whose path to the nomination will taper.

“I don’t know what their plan is to maintain that [durability],” Adams said of Biden. “Our strategy is going to be to get [Harris] out there more, and make sure that she’s like right up in people’s face when they’re making that decision.”

Even so, Harris has faced ongoing questions about her central message and reason for running, something many voters have said she has not made as clear as some competitors have. While Biden, Warren and Sanders have long-established political identities — Biden pitching himself as a return to normalcy, Warren advocating “structural change” and Sanders pushing a revolution — Harris entered the campaign without an easy-to-sum-up pitch, and has yet to establish one.

AD

AD

In the last debate, Harris often looked directly at the camera and challenged President Trump rather than her Democratic rivals, something her advisers say reflects her argument that the former California attorney general is the best candidate to “prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump.”

Harris has also touted — and spent her Iowa advertising dollars explaining — a “3 a.m. agenda,” her plan to address the issues “that keep Americans up at night.” She’s sought to position herself, between Biden on the one hand and the liberal Warren and Sanders on the other, as a “problem-solving” candidate who favors big change but will take practical steps to achieve it.

On Thursday, Adams took not-so-veiled shots at those rivals.

AD

“We have, obviously, a candidate who’s saying we should just look back to the way things were. But I think that going back is not usually how Democrats conducted campaigns,” she said in a reference to Biden.

AD

On the other hand, Adams said, “I think there are far more ideological, strict ideological candidates who I believe will contribute to the partisan rancor that we’ve seen and watched it for a long time.”

Harris intends to position herself between those two camps during the next stage of her campaign, beginning Thursday night in Coralville, Iowa.

“I’m f---ing moving to Iowa,” Harris told Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) on Wednesday, pithily summing up her strategy inadvertently within earshot of reporter Matt Laslo.

The question is how many voters in Iowa will move to her."

Charles Koch. (Bo Rader/The Wichita Eagle)

The Koch network is conceding it has lost the early fight in its battle against President Trump’s tariffs.

The powerhouse rightwing group funded partly by billionaire industrialist Charles Koch remains committed to the cause. But its leaders are acknowledging their attempt to turn voters against Trump’s preferred weapon in his trade wars through a massive political advertising campaign has mostly fallen flat and the strategy needs retooling, as CNBC’s Brian Schwartz was the first to report.

“We remain fully committed to free trade and are always adjusting our plans and tactics,” an official with Americans for Prosperity, the Koch grass-roots lobbying group, tells me in an email. “Tariffs are destructive, but we recognize that the economic toll is diffuse and not felt evenly among all Americans.”

That is, only a relatively small slice of the population has suffered acutely from Trump’s escalating import duties. That cohort includes farmers, manufacturers, and some in the retail and tech industries. But many continue backing Trump and his trade offensive nevertheless. And so do everyday consumers who haven’t felt enough pain to reassess their support of the president’s strategy.

Polls bear out the Koch group’s finding. The most recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, for example, found while 56 percent of voters say they disapprove of his trade offensive against China, another 35 percent approve, a number that aligns roughly with his overall support. Similarly, 6 in 10 said they are worried the confrontation with China will drive up the price of household staples, while 4 in 10, a healthy minority, said they were less concerned.

And the White House has doubled down on a strategy for bailing out at least one of the constituencies pinched hardest by its tit-for-tat with Beijing. The administration is doling out $28 billion in relief to farmers, a tab that makes the program “more than twice as expensive as the 2009 bailout of Detroit’s Big Three automakers, which cost taxpayers $12 billion,” Bloomberg News’s Mario and Mike Dorning write. “And farmers expect the money to keep flowing: In an August survey by Purdue University and the CME Group, 58% said they anticipate another round of trade aid next year.”

The polling and the Koch group’s pivot point to an advantage for the Trump team, and a challenge facing Democrats as they seek to put the economy front and center in the 2020 campaign. Economists agree the trade war is taking a meaningful bite out of growth at home, with Fed researchers pegging the damage at a full percentage point through the early part of next year. The conflict has stoked concerns it will hurry the arrival of the next recession.

But it’s arguably less clear Trump’s tariffs are diminishing his support among his base. “The argument that, you know, the tariffs are adding a couple thousand dollars to the pickup truck that you’re buying is not persuasive,” a senior Koch official told CNBC’s Schwartz. “It doesn’t penetrate with the people that are willing to go along with the argument that you have to punish China.”

The Koch network hasn’t yet settled on its next strategy. But it appears aimed at taking advantage of growing popular support for free trade generally. “You can look for us to engage in making the benefits of trade – taken for granted for decades - more widely appreciated,” the official told me. “Ultimately that will impact our nation's trade policy more favorably for the benefit of more Americans.""

The group first entered the fray over Trump’s trade offensive in June 2018. At the time, it pledged to wage a multiyear, multimillion-dollar campaign against the imposition of tariffs, just days after Trump slapped duties on steel and aluminum imports and prepared the first round of duties on $50 billion of Chinese goods. Now, $250 billion of Chinese imports face a 25 percent tariff, and another $112 billion face a 15 percent tariff. And Trump has pledged to further dial up the import taxes next month and again in December.

Mid-level negotiations between the countries resumed this week, an attempt to lay a foundation for more senior-level talks next month. But expectations for a breakthrough remain low.

— U.S.-China trade talks resume with large gulfs: “U.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators resumed face-to-face talks for the first time in nearly two months on Thursday, as the world’s two largest economies try to bridge deep policy differences and find a way out of their protracted trade war,” Reuters’s David Lawder reports.

“The negotiations, which will extend into Friday, are aimed at laying the groundwork for high-level talks in early October that will determine whether the two countries are working toward a solution or headed for new and higher tariffs on each other’s goods.”

Who’s leading the talks: “A delegation of about 30 Chinese officials, led by Vice Finance Minister Liao Min, met counterparts at the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR) office near the White House. Deputy USTR Jeffrey Gerrish led the U.S. delegation.”

“A delegation of about 30 Chinese officials, led by Vice Finance Minister Liao Min, met counterparts at the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR) office near the White House. Deputy USTR Jeffrey Gerrish led the U.S. delegation.” What’s on the table: “The discussions are seen focusing heavily on agriculture, including U.S. demands that China substantially increase purchases of American soybeans and other farm commodities, a person with knowledge of the planned discussions told Reuters. Two negotiating sessions over the two days will cover agricultural issues, while just one will be devoted to the strengthening of China’s intellectual property protections and the forced transfer of U.S. technology to Chinese firms.”

Michael Pillsbury: It can get a lot worse. The Hudson Institute scholar and White House whisperer on China matters warned that Trump can dramatically ramp up tariifs and use other means to pressure the Chinese if a deal isn't struck soon. ""“Does the president have options to escalate the trade war? Yes, the tariffs can be raised higher. These are low level tariffs that could go to 50 per cent or 100 per cent,” Pillsbury told the South China Morning Post. He said Trump's critics shouldn't assume he is bluffing: “There are other options involving the financial markets, Wall Street, you know, the president has a whole range of options.""

“U.S. attorneys asked for dismissal of the case, heard in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas. Attorney Emily Newton with the U.S. Department of Justice argued that Congress had ample national security reasons for the legislation.”

“AT&T is not focused on divesting or selling DirecTV, sources tell CNBC. Both options are being pushed by Elliott, which believes a Dish-DirecTV merger can get done in today’s regulatory environment even though such a deal was struck down in 2002, according to people familiar with the matter … Elliott could push harder on replacing AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson if AT&T resists splitting off DirecTV, according to people familiar with the matter.”

“Sanders' team said more than 99 percent of his donors can contribute again because they have not yet given the maximum allowable donation. The campaign also said that 125,000-plus people are giving recurring monthly contributions to Sanders.”

BULL SESSION"

A well-respected mayor who entered the race as a front-runner but failed to win a single delegate or a mayor who lost reelection as mayor, declined to continue in po… [+8647 chars]",Bill de Blasio is only the latest NYC mayor to fail to become president.,2019-09-20,The Washington Post,"Presidential runs by New York City mayors, ranked",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/20/presidential-runs-by-new-york-city-mayors-ranked/,"I’d say it’s about even.

Granted, the fate of former New York mayor John Mitchel (who served until 1917) was not a happy one, but at least he avoided the ignominy of that asterisk that lingers over the shoulders of politicians who try and fail to win the presidency. Much less those who end up as case studies in how precisely not to seek election to the White House. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

On Friday morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio became the fifth New York mayor to actively flirt with a presidential run and fail to win that office. Since the five boroughs merged in 1898 to form the city we know today, there have been 19 mayors — meaning that about 1 in 4 have figured they could parlay management of the country’s largest metropolis into managing every metropolis in the country. De Blasio’s, though, was a particularly bad attempt.

For the purposes of clarity, let’s set aside the 14 mayors who never actively explored running for the presidency, though I am firmly of the opinion that the idea of being elected president occurs to nearly every political candidate at some point, regardless of office held. (“You never know,” Ottumwa, Iowa, city councilor Fictional Monroe thinks, regarding a souvenir Washington, D.C., snow globe. “You just never know.”) That means we will not compare de Blasio’s bid to Mitchel’s post-mayoral experience, or to the nonexistent presidential bids of the various mayors who lost reelection and dropped out of politics, or to the various mayors who resigned under what would only be described as “ethical clouds” by someone who would refer to a Category 5 hurricane as a “drizzle.”

It means that we will not compare de Blasio’s bid to the fate of William Jay Gaynor, who was considered as a possible presidential contender until he got on a boat while still mayor and died of a heart attack in 1913. One factor that may have contributed to his untimely death was having been shot in the neck three years earlier by a city employee who had been fired. The shooting was captured by a photographer from the New York Tribune and ran on the front page of the paper.

I mention that because, what a story!

AD

AD

So without further tragic historical asides, here are the five presidential bids by New York mayors, ranked from most to least successful.

1. George McClellan Jr.

The most successful presidential bid from a New York mayor came from a legacy. George McClellan Jr. was the son of Civil War general George McClellan, who tried to parlay having been demoted by Abraham Lincoln into a challenge to Lincoln’s reelection in 1864. The elder McClellan was demolished, winning only two states — though, thanks to the era and the existence of the Confederacy, that was not as bad a showing as it would be today.

Anyway, McClellan Jr. ran in 1904. He earned three delegates at the Democratic convention in an era before state-by-state primaries, good enough for a tie for ninth place. By contrast, the eventual nominee, Alton Parker, had 658 delegate votes in the first tally.

AD

AD

Again: This is the best a New York mayor has ever done in a presidential contest.

2. John Lindsay

John Lindsay was handsome. That’s the thing that you hear first about Lindsay in nearly any telling, and who are we to buck tradition? He was also mayor during the late 1960s, a tumultuous time nationally and for the city itself. Various strikes destabilized day-to-day life in New York, and a violent encounter between a group of construction workers and antiwar protesters became a national symbol of tensions over Vietnam.

This, handsome ol’ Lindsay figured, was a good jumping-off point for seeking the 1972 Democratic nomination. (He had been elected as a Republican but switched parties, which will become a theme here.) He got more than 6 percent of the vote in the Florida primary, good enough for fifth place, then did about the same in Wisconsin. He dropped out soon after.

Lindsay’s true claim to fame comes from being the inspiration for the mayor of Gotham City in the wonderfully terrible 1960s Batman television show. In one two-part episode, Mayor “Linseed” is challenged by the Penguin for reelection, fares badly in polling and drops out. Batman steps in, beats the Penguin literally and politically and then just hands the mayorship back to Linseed.

I mention that because, what a story!

3. Michael Bloomberg

Michael Bloomberg was elected mayor of New York City three times — the third time after getting the city council to approve an extension of term limits so he could do so. (The council acquiesced in part so that some of the sitting members could similarly run again.)

AD

With New-York-billionaires-running-for-president being a thing at the time, Bloomberg flirted with a run in 2016, arguing that a contest between Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would offer a choice only between two ideological poles. Bloomberg — who had been a Republican, a Democrat and an independent as mayor — suggested that he would represent a middle-of-the-road option. When Hillary Clinton became the likely Democratic nominee, Bloomberg decided against running and endorsed her at the Democratic convention.

AD

By deciding against running for president, Bloomberg became the third-most-successful presidential candidate in New York City mayoral history.

4. Bill de Blasio

How is Bloomberg’s non-run more successful than de Blasio’s actual run? Because of this chart right here.

Not only did New Yorkers not want de Blasio to run in the first place, and not only did de Blasio only sporadically earn any support at all in national polls, and not only did only one (one!) resident of New York City say he supported de Blasio for the Democratic nomination in a recent poll but de Blasio’s presidential bid also eroded his already shaky support in the city itself. In March, before de Blasio announced his candidacy, he was viewed about as favorably as unfavorably in New York. In that same poll from Siena College, de Blasio’s unfavorable rating in New York City is now near 60 percent.

AD

AD

In other words, his presidential bid failed to earn him the presidency and also worsened his position in the job he already holds. That is worse than never running at all.

5. Rudy Giuliani

But that’s still better than what happened to Rudy Giuliani.

People who started paying attention to American politics only in the Trump era likely know Giuliani as the combative, often baffling frontman for Trump’s legal team. But that’s not the Giuliani America knew about 15 years ago. Then, Giuliani was “America’s Mayor,” an effusive title given to him for his stewardship of New York in the months after the 9/11 attacks. It was an honorific that Giuliani hoped he could leverage into the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.

AD

There were warning signs, though. Despite Giuliani’s national popularity, he was viewed with skepticism in New York City. He had explored a run for the Senate in 2000, where he would have faced off against Hillary Clinton, but for personal reasons — his health, the revelation of an extramarital affair — he decided against running. Because Giuliani was a former prosecutor, New Yorkers were familiar with the brashness and inconsistency the country now sees regularly.

AD

Leading into 2008, though, Giuliani was well positioned. He led the field by a healthy margin in early primary polling, and the country looked to be poised for the Giuliani-Clinton battle that had fallen apart eight years earlier.

But then Giuliani decided on an odd strategy: Skip the early states and focus on Florida, where a large population of former New Yorkers could power a sweeping victory. Among other problems with that strategy, Giuliani watched as, in state after state, other candidates won votes and media attention. Mike Huckabee won Iowa. John McCain won New Hampshire. Mitt Romney won his home state of Michigan and then Nevada. McCain eked out a win in South Carolina. By the time Florida rolled around, Giuliani was an afterthought, and he came in third. He then dropped out.

AD

Now, you may debate whether this was a worse showing than de Blasio’s, which is fair. After all, at least Giuliani earned actual votes — nearly 600,000, in fact. De Blasio, however, at least fulfilled expectations: Everyone figured he would do terribly, and he did. On that metric, Giuliani’s campaign was a bigger failure.

The good news for him, though, is this. At some point in the not-too-distant future, the odds are good that another New York mayor will try and fail at winning the presidency. And that inevitable failure might somehow manage to break Giuliani’s record.

In 1977, David Frost pressed Richard Nixon on why he had authorized burglaries, wiretapping and other illegal actions. “Well, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal,” Nixon answered.

President Trump’s personal attorney appeared on CNN shortly after The Washington Post reported that an intelligence official's whistleblower complaint about Trump centers on Ukraine. Giuliani spoke at length about hypothetical wrongdoing – and the president’s right to do it.

“The complaint involved communications with a foreign leader and a ‘promise’ that Trump made, which was so alarming that a U.S. intelligence official who had worked at the White House went to the inspector general of the intelligence community,” Ellen Nakashima, Shane Harris, Greg Miller and Carol Leonnig reported. “Two and a half weeks before the complaint was filed, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian and political newcomer who was elected in a landslide in May. That call is already under investigation by House Democrats who are examining whether Trump and [Giuliani] sought to manipulate the Ukrainian government into helping Trump’s reelection campaign. … The Democrats’ investigation was launched earlier this month, before revelations that an intelligence official had lodged a complaint with the inspector general.”

-- Giuliani contradicted himself when asked whether he pressed the Ukrainian government to look into former vice president Joe Biden. Initially, he said no. Thirty seconds later, he said: “Of course I did.”

“You want to cover some ridiculous charge that I urged the Ukrainian government to investigate corruption. Well, I did. And I’m proud of it,” Giuliani said, channeling his inner Nathan Jessup from “A Few Good Men.”

-- Perhaps more revealing, though, was when Cuomo asked Giuliani if Trump told the new Ukrainian president what he wanted done with investigations into Biden and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. “I never asked him that,” Giuliani said. “I don’t know if he did, and I wouldn’t care if he did. He had every right to do it as the president of the United States. He had every right to say to the Ukrainian president that we have two outstanding allegations of massive corruption, and you should investigate.”

-- Giuliani then suggested that it would actually be commendable for Trump to demand investigations. “All I can tell you is, if what is reported is true, it doesn’t make a dam,” Giuliani said. “It doesn’t make any difference. If the president of the United States said to the president of Ukraine, investigate the corruption in your country that has a bearing on our 2016 election, isn’t that what he’s supposed to do?”

-- In a tweet after the interview, Giuliani reiterated that the president is “doing his job” by telling a foreign leader to investigate corruption:

A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job. Maybe if Obama did that the Biden Family wouldn’t have bilked millions from Ukraine and billions from China; being covered up by a Corrupt Media. — Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 20, 2019

-- Giuliani later told Robert Costa that he expects to meet with Trump today:

Checked in w/ Giuliani a few mins before midnight. Said he hasn't spoken w/ Trump since Cuomo. But expects to see him Fri. Said his tweet doesn't confirm anything but ""only that if he did do it, it'd be appropriate."" Declined to discuss timing of last convo w/ POTUS on Ukraine. — Robert Costa (@costareports) September 20, 2019

-- Trump denied wrongdoing in fresh tweets this morning:

....statement. Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2019

-- We’ve seen this movie before. During the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, Trump’s legal team argued that the president could not technically be guilty of obstructing justice.

“Collusion is not a crime,” Giuliani said on Fox News in July 2018.

“I don't even know if that's a crime — colluding with Russians,” the former New York mayor, speaking as Trump’s lawyer, added on CNN that same day. “Hacking is the crime. The president didn't hack. He didn't pay for the hacking.”

-- These are remarkable stances to take, and they should be viewed as part of this president and his team’s Nixonian and imperial view of presidential prerogative. In Tuesday’s edition, for example, I wrote about just how aggressively the White House counsel is pushing the envelope by claiming that former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who has never worked for the executive branch, is covered by executive privilege. Among other things, Attorney General William Barr has spent his career championing the expansion of presidential powers. (Tom Hamburger took a deep dive on this history in May.)

-- Trump filed a federal lawsuit yesterday against the Manhattan district attorney in an attempt to block him from subpoenaing tax returns in a probe of the hush-money payments made before the 2016 election. “In the suit, Trump argues that District Attorney Cyrus Vance is conducting a criminal investigation of him, which he contends is not allowed under the Constitution,” David A. Fahrenthold reports. “That’s because the Constitution prohibits any prosecutor from investigating any sitting president for any criminal wrongdoing, he says. If that were permitted, Trump says, it could give local authorities too much power to hamstring a president’s actions. ‘All you need is one prosecutor, one trial judge, the barest amount of probable cause, and a supportive local constituency, and you can shut down a presidency,’ Trump’s complaint says, quoting law professor Jed Shugerman ... Instead, Trump argued, the power to investigate presidents is invested in Congress, which has the power to impeach and remove presidents for ‘high crimes and misdemeanors.’”

-- But, but, but: Trump won’t cooperate with Congress as it seeks to investigate him. His administration is systematically stonewalling subpoenas, including for the whistleblower’s report about the president’s conduct toward Ukraine.

-- The Post’s Editorial Board reported on Sept. 5 that it had been “reliably told” that Trump was holding back military assistance for Ukraine (to defend itself against the revanchist Russia) in an attempt to force Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of Biden: “The strong-arming of Mr. Zelensky was openly reported to the New York Times last month by … Giuliani, who said he had met in Madrid with a close associate of the Ukrainian leader and urged that the new government restart an investigation of Mr. Biden and his son. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, while Joe Biden, as vice president, urged the dismissal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor, who investigated the firm.” (The Post’s Fact Checker team scrutinized claims by Trump and Giuliani about Biden’s son and Ukraine in May.)

-- What’s the status of the whistleblower complaint? “On Thursday, the inspector general testified behind closed doors to members of the House Intelligence Committee,” per Ellen, Shane, Greg and Carol. “Over the course of three hours, Michael Atkinson repeatedly declined to discuss with members the content of the complaint, saying he was not authorized to do so. Atkinson made clear that he disagreed with a lawyer for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who had contradicted the inspector general and found that the whistleblower complaint did not meet the statutory definition of an urgent concern because it involved a matter not under the DNI’s jurisdiction. Atkinson told lawmakers that he disagreed with that analysis — meaning he felt the matter was under the DNI’s purview — and also that it was urgent ‘in the common understanding of the word’ … Atkinson told the committee that the complaint did not stem from just one conversation…”

-- Coming attractions: Following the meeting, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) warned of legal action if the whistleblower complaint is withheld. “We’re determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is to make sure that the national security is protected,” he said at a news conference. Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify next Thursday before the Intelligence Committee in a public session.

-- The Times confirmed last night that the whistleblower’s complaint involves “at least one instance of Trump making an unspecified commitment to a foreign leader” and “at least part of the allegation” deals with Ukraine. “According to government officials who handle foreign policy in the United States and Ukraine, Mr. Giuliani’s efforts created the impression that the Trump administration’s willingness to back Mr. Zelensky was linked to his government’s readiness to in turn pursue the investigations sought by Mr. Trump’s allies,” Julian Barnes, Nicholas Fandos, Michael Schmidt and Matthew Rosenberg report.

“Around the same time, a separate issue was brewing. Congressional aides and administration officials who work on Ukraine issues had become concerned that the White House was slow-walking a military assistance package for Kiev,” per the Times. “Last week, the two issues merged when Mr. Schiff and two other Democratic House committee chairmen requested the transcript of Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Zelensky from the State Department … The next day, Mr. Schiff wrote to Mr. Maguire seeking information about the whistle-blower complaint. And the following day, the White House released the military assistance to Ukraine, with little explanation.”

-- Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) met with Zelensky a few weeks ago in Ukraine, he tweeted, “and we discussed the surprise cut off of aid and the inappropriate demands the Trump campaign was making of him. The obvious question everyone in Kiev was asking was - were the two things connected?” Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, added:

I don’t know what is in the whistleblower complaint, but it was clear to me that Ukraine officials were worried about the consequences of ignoring Giuliani’s demands. And of course they were. That’s why presidents shouldn’t have their campaigns talking to foreign leaders. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019

-- Even the Ukrainian government’s official readout of Trump’s phone call with Zelensky said the president told him that that Ukraine could improve its reputation and “interaction” with the United States by investigating corruption.

-- Critics were aghast, and many argued that Trump might have committed an impeachable offense in his conduct toward Ukraine. From a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama:

This is going to be huge. DOJ& Admin are contorting themselves backwards to try to hide this. Truth will come out. There are probably tapes and transcripts documenting a gross abuse of power by Trump.

From a Harvard Law professor:

If it’s Ukraine, then this looks very much like a promise of US arms or other aid in return for dirt on a political opponent’s family (Biden’s son Hunter) — both a violation of federal campaign law and bribery, an explicitly impeachable offense.

-- Bill de Blasio announced on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that he’s dropping out of the presidential race. “It’s clearly not my time,” he said. The New York mayor didn’t quality for last week’s debate and likely wouldn’t make the cut for the next one. Trump weighed in quickly with a facetious tweet:

Oh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years! Part time Mayor of New York City, @BilldeBlasio, who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth, has shocking dropped out of the Presidential race. NYC is devastated, he’s coming home! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2019

-- Tropical Storm Imelda has left at least two dead in Texas. Brittney Martin, Brittany Shammas and Hannah Knowles report: ""Heavy rainfall shut down major roadways, triggered hundreds of calls for help and invited comparisons to Hurricane Harvey of 2017 as Gov. Greg Abbott (R) declared a state of emergency for portions of the state. ... In Houston, a man between the ages of 40 and 50 died after being transported from a submerged van to a hospital in critical condition ... Officials extracted several people from the vehicle, according to Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. Earlier in the day, a 19-year-old man suffered an electric shock and drowned...""

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- Senior Trump administration officials are considering a plan to again divert billions of dollars in military funding to pay for border barrier construction next year, according to three administration officials. Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey scoop: “The president has pledged to complete nearly 500 miles of new barrier by the 2020 election … But that construction goal will require a total of $18.4 billion in funding through 2020, far more than the administration has publicly disclosed, the administration’s latest internal projections show. Planning documents obtained by The Washington Post show the cost of building 509 miles of barriers averages out to more than $36 million per mile. The documents also show that the government would need to obtain — either by eminent-domain claims or purchases — land that lies under nearly 200 miles of proposed barrier. …

“The White House also has requested $5 billion for barrier funding in 2020 through the Department of Homeland Security budget, but if that money is not approved, the administration plans to dip into the Pentagon’s construction budget for the second consecutive year to get another $3.6 billion … The planning document distributed at the meeting led by [Jared] Kushner last week indicates that 187 of the 509 miles of proposed border barrier are on private land — more than one-third of the total. On Wednesday, the Interior Department announced the transfer of 560 acres of federal land to the Army to facilitate barrier construction along a 70-mile stretch of the border. Trump also has taken an increasingly keen interest in aesthetic elements of the barrier, insisting it should be painted black and topped with spikes, despite the cost increases associated with those elements.”

-- Border Patrol agents are now conducting asylum seekers’ “credible fear” interviews under a new controversial pilot program. From CBS News: The move “means that some migrants will not be initially interviewed by highly-trained asylum officers well-versed in U.S. and international refugee law, but by law enforcement agents from the agency that apprehended them. The Trump administration has advocated for this new role for Border Patrol, arguing that its agents would not approve as many ‘credible fear’ interviews.”

-- A Honduran mother and her toddler drowned in the Rio Grande after trying to enter the U.S. Idalia Yamileth Herrera Hernandez and her 21-month-old, Iker Gael Cordova Herrera, had recently entered the U.S. and made an asylum request but were sent to Mexico to wait for an immigration court hearing under Trump's Migrant Protection Protocols program, informally known as “Remain in Mexico.” Growing desperate after sleeping on the street and in shelters, Herrera Hernandez attempted to cross the river with her son. Their bodies were recovered last week after an “intensive search,” according to a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson. (CNN)

-- Their deaths highlight a cruel effect of Trump’s policy: More children are dying at the border. From BuzzFeed News: ""Advocates said MPP forces asylum-seekers to live in dangerous Mexican cities with few resources and little protection. Some grow desperate enough that they can no longer wait, and are driven to cross the US border illegally. … So far in 2019, 15 children have died at the US–Mexico border, according to data from the International Organization for Migration. That is the highest number of dead children since 2014, which is when the organization started tracking deaths along migratory routes ... Previously, the highest number of children who died at the US–Mexico border was nine, in 2018, and before that it was eight in 2016.”

-- Bowing to pressure, the Department of Homeland Security is formally backing off its plans to deport sick immigrant children. In a letter sent to the House Oversight Committee, DHS said it is “resuming its consideration of non-military deferred action requests on a discretionary, case-by-case basis,” per NBC News.

-- Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson made dismissive comments about transgender people, angering his staff. Tracy Jan and Jeff Stein report: “Carson expressed concern about ‘big, hairy men’ trying to infiltrate women’s homeless shelters during an internal meeting, according to three people present who interpreted the remarks as an attack on transgender women. While visiting HUD’s San Francisco office this week, Carson also lamented that society no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women, two of the agency staffers said. Carson’s remarks visibly shocked and upset many of the roughly 50 HUD staffers who attended Tuesday’s meeting, and prompted at least one woman to walk out in protest, the staffers said. ...

""As HUD Secretary, he weakened Obama-era protections for transgender people ... In May, the agency introduced a proposal that would allow federally funded shelters to deny people admission on religious grounds or force transgender women to share bathrooms and sleeping quarters with men. ... Transgender advocates called HUD’s defense of Carson a common, damaging and insulting trope that had long been debunked.""

-- Trump picked Eugene Scalia, a son of late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia and a former lobbyist, as his next labor secretary. Democrats quickly found anti-gay op-eds he wrote in college. Eli Rosenberg reports: “Eugene Scalia … faced harsh questioning during his confirmation hearing Thursday as Democrats criticized the former lobbyist’s record defending corporations in legal matters against workers and regulators. But he was also put on the spot about his past claim that gay parents should be treated differently than a ‘traditional family’ under law. Scalia worked to parry back many of the more pointed questions by Democrats during the hearing, but he declined to give specific answers about whether some of his past views have changed. … Scalia remains very popular among Republicans, though, and is expected to be confirmed by the Senate because the GOP holds a 53-47 majority. If confirmed, Scalia would be the seventh former lobbyist to hold a Cabinet post in the Trump administration’s first three years, far out pacing the numbers presidents Obama and Bush had in their eight years each in office.”

-- The Education Department ordered Duke University and the University of North Carolina to revamp their joint Middle Eastern studies program, claiming the curriculum puts “considerable emphasis” on the positive aspects of Islam and reflects anti-Israel bias. Laura Meckler and Valerie Strauss report: “The agency ordered the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies to revise its offerings or risk losing its $235,000 federal grant. … The letter, sent in August, was published this week in the Federal Register, and was seen as a move to put other universities on notice. It was not clear whether other programs have been asked to revise their offerings. The action represents a rare case of the federal government weighing into the administration of an academic program, but is consistent with how Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and some of her senior aides have tried to reshape U.S. universities they say are ideologically skewed.”

-- Trump continues holding up decisions on gun control, partly because he’s concerned about the political repercussions of any choice he makes. He has few trusted advisers to assist him, and he’s found himself even more isolated now that his longtime assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, is gone, reports the Times: Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney fired Westerhout last month for indiscreetly sharing details of the first family, but she “had been one of the president’s few organizing influences ... In the weeks since she left, Mr. Trump has gone back and forth on his feelings about Mr. Mulvaney, praising him one day and denouncing him the next, people familiar with the discussions said. For longtime Republican analysts, Mr. Trump has a single track he should be traveling on, and any distractions that cause him to take his eyes off could be disastrous politically.”

-- Colt, the U.S. firearms company, will suspend the production of rifles for the civilian market – including the AR-15, a weapon infamous for its popularity among mass shooters. Bit it's not for the reason you might think: The company said there are so many of these weapons already in the hands of American consumers that it makes no sense to produce more. Reis Thebault reports: “‘Given this level of manufacturing capacity, we believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future,’ Dennis Veilleux said, adding that the pivot was not permanent. … Veilleux said his company remains a fierce advocate for gun rights and for the consumer gun market. … The company will concentrate on its military and law enforcement contracts, which Veilleux said are ‘absorbing all of Colt’s manufacturing capacity for rifles.’”

-- Federal officials said at least 530 people in 38 states have become sickened by a mysterious vaping-related lung illness. Lena H. Sun reports: “In a sign of the seriousness of the e-cigarette investigation, officials disclosed that the enforcement arm of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been conducting a probe in parallel with the public health investigation led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials said they still do not know the cause of the lung injuries that are making people so sick. There have been seven confirmed deaths.”

-- More than 3.3 million American women’s first sexual experience was rape, according to a new study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study found that the average age women had this experience was around 15, Kayla Epstein reports.

-- The attorney general once celebrated as “masterful” a book that criticized campus sexual assault investigations. “Your blood will boil as the authors meticulously examine scores of cases where, in the name of political correctness, male students are sacrificed to the mob, with academic leaders happily serving as the hangmen,” Barr wrote in a blurb for the Kindle edition of “The Campus Rage Frenzy: The Attack on Due Process at America’s Universities,” reports Marisa Iati.

-- The Senate Foreign Relations Committee postponed the confirmation hearing for former Republican congressman Darrell Issa to lead the Trade and Development Agency over an undisclosed issue in his FBI background check. The abrupt delay came after Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said the background check might be “problematic and potentially disqualifying for Senate confirmation,” report Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. Issa, who has been flirting with challenging Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) in a primary if he cannot get confirmed, suggested the issue relates to behavior when he was a young man.

-- A sting operation led to the arrest of a New York Police Department officer who moonlighted as a bodyguard for El Chapo’s wife. Ishmael Bailey, who had been an NYPD officer for 12 years, was arrested in Queens for allegedly transporting cocaine, per the Wall Street Journal.

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- North America has lost 3 billion birds representing hundreds of species in the past 50 years, an “overlooked biodiversity crisis,” according to a major study from top ornithologists and government agencies. Karin Brulliard reports: ""Slowly, steadily and almost imperceptibly, North America’s bird population is dwindling. The sparrows and finches that visit backyard feeders number fewer each year. The flutelike song of the western meadowlark — the official bird of six U.S. states — is growing more rare. ... This is not an extinction crisis — yet. It is a more insidious decline in abundance as humans dramatically alter the landscape: There are 29 percent fewer birds in the United States and Canada today than in 1970, the study concludes. Grassland species have been hardest hit, probably because of agricultural intensification that has engulfed habitats and spread pesticides that kill the insects many birds eat. But the victims include warblers, thrushes, swallows and other familiar birds. ...

""The study’s authors, who include scientists from Canada’s environment agency and the U.S. Geological Survey, were able to put a number on the decline because birds are probably the best-monitored animals on Earth. … Birds, because they are so well-monitored, should be viewed as canaries in coal mines, the authors argue — harbingers of a wider environmental malaise at a time when other creatures, including insects, are also thought to be fading but are more challenging to count. ... A recent United Nations report warned that 1 million animal and plant species are at risk of extinction as people log, farm and mine the natural world and as the climate warms. But in the case of most dwindling bird species, the problem is not that they are in immediate danger of vanishing. Instead, the authors say, bird populations are shrinking at rates we do not see, and so do not act upon. Conservationists refer to this as ‘shrinking baseline syndrome,’ and it can have devastating effects: Passenger pigeons were once so abundant that their massive flocks darkened U.S. skies. They were driven to extinction in just a few decades.""

-- A group of more than 200 investment funds managing $16 trillion urged companies in Brazil to fight deforestation in the Amazon. Marina Lopes reports from Sao Paulo: “‘Considering increasing deforestation rates and recent fires in the Amazon, we are concerned that companies exposed to potential deforestation in their Brazilian operations and supply chains will face increasing difficulty accessing international markets,’ the investors wrote. They called on companies to establish a no-deforestation policy and to report on their suppliers’ compliance. They did not advise funds against considering investments in Brazil. Still, the letter is the harshest rebuke from the international financial community since the country came under scrutiny this summer for spikes in deforestation and fires in the world’s largest rainforest.”

-- In Maracaibo, Venezuela’s oil capital, life is a struggle, but so is death. Anthony Faoila and Rachelle Krygier report: “An economic free fall more severe than the Great Depression has crippled this onetime oil boomtown, and those who have stayed are bracing for worse under increasingly tough U.S. sanctions. Venezuela’s second-largest city — and its industrial engine — is now the epicenter of the socialist nation’s societal meltdown. The collapse of civilization here is perhaps most evident at death. On the afternoon of [security guard Neiro] Vargas’s passing, Maracaibo University Hospital, suffering the same major power outages plaguing the rest of the city, was stiflingly hot. His destitute family was unable to immediately pay for a funeral. So doctors dispatched his body to ‘the basement.’ The un-air-conditioned morgue. Even when the power flickers on, none of the morgue’s eight freezers work. On a recent morning, insects swarmed the seven decomposing bodies left on slabs and on the floor. A dead baby lay rotting in a cardboard box.”

-- The U.S. moved to expel a pair of Cuban diplomats from their posts at the country’s U.N. mission, the Wall Street Journal reports. The administration is alleging that the diplomats attempted to conduct influence “operations” against the U.S. ahead of next week’s U.N. gathering.

-- Hong Kong protesters claim that police officers on the island are beating and torturing them. Shibani Mahtani reports: “When lawyer Hermes Chan visited a 19-year-old client in the hospital last month, he found her lying limp in bed under police watch. Bruises covered her arms, knees and shins like patchwork. The young woman had been fleeing from riot police, Chan said … An officer grabbed her by the collar, yanking her upward so that her back was exposed, before pushing her to the floor and pummeling her … A report from Amnesty International, released Friday local time, suggests that the woman’s experience is part of an ‘alarming pattern’ of ‘reckless and indiscriminate’ tactics employed by Hong Kong’s police, who have stepped up their use of force since June as unrest in the semiautonomous Chinese territory has snowballed.”

-- The White House is temporarily exempting more than 400 Chinese products from tariffs activated last year as part of the U.S.'s ongoing economic sparring with Beijing. Rachel Siegel reports: “The exclusions cover a wide range of goods, including plastic straws, coffee filters, dog leashes and car radiators, according to documents published Friday by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and stem from more than 1,100 exclusion requests made by companies and other U.S. entities. The decision comes as the U.S. and China are expected to meet for high-level trade talks next month and as both sides have toned down the rhetoric that has defined the year-long conflict.”

-- A top official in the political network led by Charles Koch said their strategy to challenge Trump’s trade war with China has been a failure. From CNBC: “Koch network leaders said Thursday that their digital and TV ad blitz that emphasized how Americans could experience financial pain from the tariff fight wasn’t panning out the way they had hoped. ‘The argument that, you know, the tariffs are adding a couple thousand dollars to the pickup truck that you’re buying is not persuasive,’ a senior Koch official ... said during a briefing in New York. ‘It doesn’t penetrate with the people that are willing to go along with the argument that you have to punish China.’ ...

""[T]he network came to this conclusion after conducting weekly focus groups on trade policies. … Koch network officials said the organization will put out ads with a new message, although, according to one network leader it is unclear what that message will be. … ‘I think that we were wrong about how to change this one. We made a bet that the kind of retail, running ads and rallies, that sort of thing, to talk about the coming harm of tariffs, which we know is coming, would be persuasive,’ the same official said. ‘And we were wrong about that.’""

-- China detained an American pilot who works for FedEx as tensions with the U.S. rise. The pilot is U.S. Air Force veteran Todd Hohn, who lives in Hong Kong. FedEx said authorities had found an object in the pilot’s luggage, but didn’t specify what it was. (New York Times)

-- Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized again after a video emerged showing him wearing blackface a day after two photos were published showing him wearing similar racist makeup. From Amanda Coletta: “The emergence of images from years or decades ago in which Trudeau wore blackface or brownface have dealt the Liberal leader’s assiduously crafted image and already shaky bid for reelection a potentially crippling blow. ‘This thing is a wildfire,’ said Darrell Bricker, chief executive of the polling firm Ipsos Public Affairs in Toronto. ‘All of a sudden there’s just a picture, and you don’t have to explain it. Everyone knows what it is.’ … The Conservatives have been running election ads warning that Trudeau was ‘not as advertised.’ Now the images … appeared to validate the message. Trudeau, 47, apologized again Thursday for the incidents … ‘Darkening your face, regardless of the context or the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface,' Trudeau said.”

-- The attack on Saudi Arabia is testing the U.S. promise to defend the Persian Gulf. From the Times: “Experts had predicted for months that the Trump administration’s ‘maximum pressure’ campaign of sanctions against Iran’s oil sales would drive it to lash out against the oil production of Saudi Arabia and the Arab Gulf States. The rulers of those Arab states had previously accused President Obama of trying to pull back from the American commitment to the region. They faulted him for negotiating a 2015 deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program … And the Gulf leaders were outraged when Mr. Obama called off a planned strike against Syria, an Iranian ally, for using chemical weapons against civilians. Now some prominent voices in the Arab Gulf States accuse Mr. Trump of an even greater betrayal. ‘Trump, in his response to Iran, is even worse than Obama,’ said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent political scientist in the United Arab Emirates.”

-- Saudi Arabia is bullying wealthy families to buy in to the initial public offering of its state oil company, which has been billed as the world’s biggest ever IPO. From the Financial Times: “Many of the families targeted had members previously imprisoned in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2017 and 2018, in what the government billed as a crackdown on corruption. Some of the detainees said they were tortured, according to people aware of the matter. Most were later freed after they reached financial settlements with the state.""

-- Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson said most of the thorniest challenges he faced during his stint as the country’s main diplomat had to do with his relationship with his boss. From the Harvard Gazette: “His plans [on the Middle East] were hampered by a frosty relationship with [Trump], who solicited foreign policy advice from an array of outside sources and delegated several key portions of the portfolio, like drafting an Israeli/Palestinian peace accord, to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. So, in the end, Tillerson took a back seat on most issues involving the Middle East and served as an informal counselor, offering his input ‘to help them identify obstacles or gaps to the [peace] plan to give it the highest chance of success,’ he said.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Former Massachusetts Republican governor Bill Weld, challening Trump for the GOP nomination, said he backs Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III in his primary bid against Sen. Edward Markey. “I’m for Kennedy,” Weld told Post reporters. “I’ve known him since the day he was born.” “He doesn’t want my endorsement,” Weld added quickly, per Annie Linskey.

-- Quite the turnaround here: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed support for providing states with an additional $250 million in election security funding. “Democrats hailed the news but said more needs to be done,"" Felicia Sonmez and Erica Werner report.

-- An internal National Republican Senatorial Committee poll, leaked to the Wall Street Journal, shows that former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, who blew a winnable governor's race last year and who co-chaired Trump's failed election ""fraud"" commission, trails Democrat Barry Grissom by 10 points in a head-to-head matchup for the seat opening up next year with Sen. Pat Roberts's retirement. (WSJ)

-- America has two economies, and they’re diverging fast. The Brookings Institute and the Wall Street Journal have a report with profound implications: “For one thing, the two parties have in just 10 years gone from near-parity on prosperity and income measures to stark, fast-moving divergence. … With their output surging as a result of the big-city tilt of the decade’s ‘winner-take-most’ economy, Democratic districts have seen their median household income soar in a decade—from $54,000 in 2008 to $61,000 in 2018. By contrast, the income level in Republican districts began slightly higher in 2008, but then declined from $55,000 to $53,000. … Relatedly, and equally striking, Democratic districts are rapidly increasing their dominance of the nation’s urban-tilting professional and digital services employment while ceding their historical, more rural shares of manufacturing and agriculture-mining activity. … Conversely, Republican districts—failing as a group to gain traction in the new sectors—have reverted to more ‘traditional’ ones.”

-- A California judge temporarily blocked a state law requiring Trump to release his tax returns in order to appear on the ballot in the state’s primary election. U.S. District Judge Morrison England Jr. said the law, signed earlier this year by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, would’ve caused “irreparable harm without temporary relief” for Trump and other candidates. (Fox News)

-- Pete Buttigieg accused Elizabeth Warren of being “extremely evasive” when it comes to explaining how she’d finance her Medicare-for-all plan. From ABC News: “Buttigieg was responding to a question about Warren's appearance Wednesday on ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’ in which she said health care costs would decrease but stopped short of saying whether middle-class taxes would increase. … ‘I think it’s puzzling …Why you wouldn't just say so and then explain why you think that's the better way forward?’ Buttigieg asked, noting that [Bernie Sanders] has said his plan to provide ‘Medicare for All’ would raise taxes across the board. ‘Look, people are used to Washington politicians not giving straight answers to simple questions.’”

-- Staffers at the Working Families Party have faced harassment after the progressive group endorsed Warren over Sanders. From Time: “Maurice Mitchell, the National Director of the Working Families Party (WFP) and an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, received messages calling him a ‘half man’ and ‘Uncle Tom,’ and telling him to ‘go back to his slave masters' … The endorsement, one of the first from a progressive group, was seen a triumph for Warren and a setback for Sanders, who has praised the Working Families Party as an example of ‘my vision of Democratic socialism.’ In the days since, WFP staffers were inundated with messages calling them ‘liberal sellouts,’ ‘corporate frauds,’ and ‘just as corrupt as the DNC,’ often accompanied with the hashtag #BernieorBust.”

-- The Sanders campaign said it has now received contributions from over 1 million individual donors. (CBS News)

-- Joe Biden won endorsements from African American lawmakers and a former governor of Florida. From the AP: “The backing from Reps. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Charlie Crist of Florida reflects Biden’s play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary. Butterfield and Cleaver are former chairmen of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Crist was the governor of Florida before he entered Congress.”

-- Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) was once on DeVos’s side on school choice. What changed? Michael Karnish reports: “Booker served with her on the boards of pro-voucher groups, attended numerous meetings with her across the country, and supported key parts of her agenda. Like a number of elected officials representing cities with poor education records, Booker sought alternatives to a failing system. He decided to back vouchers and charter schools. Booker’s political career took off as a parade of wealthy philanthropists, hedge fund managers and others who supported DeVos’s ‘school choice’ viewpoint poured money into his campaigns and pet projects. But as Booker runs for president, his relationship with DeVos, his previous support of vouchers and his continuing praise for charter schools present potential roadblocks. … Booker said Newark’s public schools were in crisis when he became a City Council member and then mayor. With the state having seized control of the city’s failed school system, he said he was ‘desperate’ for anything and anyone who could help the city’s children.”
