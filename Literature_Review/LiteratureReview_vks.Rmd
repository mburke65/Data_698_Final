## Research Question: Do publications negatively portray certain candidates more than other candidates?

### Literature Review

Our capstone project aims to measure bias in media coverage of candidates in US presidential elections. This section is a survey of published literature and analyses addressing the broader issue of measuring and quantifying political bias in general.

Sheth’s (Sheth 2016) research goal was to measure the ideological bias in news coverage by mainstream media outlets. Terms in the news articles were classified based on detected political affiliations: pro-conservative, anti-conservative, pro-liberal and anti-liberal. Once classified, Sheth was able to detect the overall measurement of political bias in each article. Sheth found that media coverage was broadly anti-conservative. It was also discovered that the news outlets, regardless of political affiliations, were resoundingly negative and critical of the opposition instead of championing their respective candidates. The Sheth study findings align with the general public’s perception of media bias. 

There have been also attempts to understand the role of bias in a theoretical framework that includes profit-maximizing and competitive pressures, consumer preferences and regulatory forces, and the economic and financial environment in which news organizations must survive. Baron (2004) presents such a theory of bias that explicates its specific correlations with consumer expectations, hiring and cost pressures, news media prices, and ideological biases among professional journalists themselves. It shows that several forces combine to ensure the presence and prevalence of unbalanced reporting.

Bernhardt et al (2008) is an examination of the effects of media bias. It examines the conditions that can cause media bias to generate undesirable results ("electoral mistakes"). It shows that the effect of media bias is more powerful and determinative than commonly presumed, since its effect cannot be nullified even if a rational consumer were to take into account its influence.

Stone (2011) presents the counterintuitive thesis that bias can be more prevalent in certain competitive media markets than in some less competitive ones. It presents a formal proof that consumers can, for example, be less informed in some media duopolies than in some monopolies. Thus one must guard against simplistic prescriptions on how to counter bias, since its correlations with market conditions can be contrary to intuition.
