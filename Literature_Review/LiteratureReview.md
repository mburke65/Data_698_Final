## Literature Review

### Research Question: Do publications negatively portray certain candidates more than other candidates?

**Sheth, Dev. “Measuring Ideological Bias in News Coverage of Political Events by Print Media Using Data Analytics.” Rochester Institute of Technology , 2016, pp. 1–21.**




Sheth’s research goal was to measure the ideological bias in news coverage by mainstream media outlets. Terms in the news articles were classified based on detected political affiliations: pro-conservative, anti-conservative, pro-liberal and anti-liberal. Once classified, Sheth was able to detect the overall measurement of political bias in each article. Sheth found that media coverage was broadly anti-conservative. It was also discovered that the news outlets, regardless of political affiliations, were resoundingly negative and critical of the opposition instead of championing their respective candidates. The Sheth study findings align with the general public’s perception of media bias.
