It’s not hard to imagine why Biden didn’t press Hunter. The Biden boys and their father had been through hell together. Hunter has said his first memory was waking up in the hospital next to his older brother, Beau, after the car crash that killed their mother and baby sister. He grew up to be a troubled man, his life pockmarked by addiction and failure.

Beau died of brain cancer a few months before Biden traveled to Ukraine to push the government to crack down on corruption. It’s not shocking that, at a moment when his family was consumed by grief, Biden wasn’t inclined to confront his surviving son.

But even if you’re not inclined to empathize with Biden — even if you assume the worst about him — Trump’s conspiracy theory makes no sense. To believe it, you’d have to first believe that the foreign affairs apparatus of the Obama administration was willing to put its credibility on the line in service of the black sheep of the Biden family. After all, Joe Biden wasn’t freelancing in Ukraine; he was carrying out White House policy.

Further, if the Trump administration truly believes that Obama’s Ukraine policy was crooked, one might ask why it has Pyatt, who helped accomplish that policy, representing America as ambassador to Greece.

Most important, getting rid of Shokin made an investigation of Burisma more likely, not less. “He didn’t want to investigate Burisma,” the Ukrainian anti-corruption activist Daria Kaleniuk told The Washington Post. “Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.”

However bad the optics around Hunter Biden, Joe Biden was not serving his son’s interests. If anything, they were working at cross-purposes."

Will Warren Top Him?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/democrats-q3-fundraising-numbers.html,"This weekend, top Biden donors and bundlers have been invited to a retreat in Philadelphia to discuss the campaign’s next phase.

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

The fund-raising announcement comes as Mr. Sanders’s campaign begins a crucial phase of his presidential bid. He and his advisers had tried for months to portray the race as a battle between Mr. Sanders and Joseph R. Biden Jr., but the surge of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, has scrambled that strategy. The top tier of candidates in the field has narrowed faster than his advisers expected, complicating matters: Rather than competing for the nomination with a half dozen candidates, he is essentially battling just two right now — Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren."

Ms. Harris’s third-quarter number is far below what some other candidates reported this week: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., raised $19.1 million; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont announced an eye-popping $25.3 million haul, the largest of any candidate this cycle. Two other top tier candidates, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have yet to release their third-quarter totals.

Ms. Harris’s total for the second quarter of the year was $11.8 million, helped by a strong online donation push in the final days. This quarter, which included a summer largely spent at a slew of closed-door events and away from the campaign trail , Ms. Harris has seen her financial standing hold steady even as her political prospects fell.

Now he is caught in the middle of a domestic one . He will be pressed to explain what he knew — after acknowledging that he listened in on a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky — and how he reacted when he heard his boss seek political help.

“I was on the phone call,” he said Wednesday, but ignored a question about what he thought about Mr. Trump’s requests.

That admission was a marked change. In interviews in recent weeks, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly evaded questions about the content of the call between the two presidents, and never volunteered that he had listened in.

In an interview on Sept. 22, days before the White House released a transcript of the call, Mr. Pompeo suggested that he was unaware of the details, telling Martha Raddatz of ABC that he had not seen the whistle-blower report and then describing American policy toward Ukraine in traditional terms, without reference to the favors Mr. Trump sought.

The Benghazi hearings that first brought national attention to Mr. Pompeo, then a conservative congressman from Kansas, investigated systematic security failings after four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed in an attack on a diplomatic outpost and a nearby C.I.A. annex in 2012. The two-year congressional inquiry — one of the most bitterly partisan in history — concluded that the State Department and the C.I.A. did not appreciate the high security risk in Benghazi, but found no evidence that Mrs. Clinton was directly to blame.

Like the Benghazi hearings, the impeachment proceedings, opened last week by House Democrats, are as immersed in diplomacy as they are in political intrigue. In recent days Mr. Pompeo’s role in the Ukraine chain of events has become increasingly clearer — and ever closer to the center of the controversy."

The forum, sponsored by two gun control organizations and MSNBC, was intended as a platform for a policy discussion — but it quickly became an outlet for rising anxiety among Democrats who fear the country has grown numb to mass shootings, like the ones that took place during a single August weekend in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio.

“It’s not an intellectual issue,” said Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, speaking to an audience that included the families of some shooting victims. “This is living with a sense of urgency. We cannot wait. This is no time for an impotence of empathy. We cannot wait until this hell is upon your community for you to be activated in this fight.”

It was very revealing.

At mid-concert, the chairman of the Kennedy Center, David M. Rubinstein, came out to greet the audience and the V.I.P.s. He welcomed the different ambassadors, then he went through the cabinet members present and then the Supreme Court justices. He introduced Justice Samuel Alito, who got a smattering of applause. Then he introduced Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seated in the balcony. First many women in the audience stood up to applaud. And then everyone stood up. And then everyone applauded. And then everyone applauded more. And then some people cheered. And then some whistled. And it went on and on and on.

It was extraordinary. I’ve been to a lot of Kennedy Center concerts, and a few when the president, sitting in his official box, was introduced. But I’ve never witnessed anything like the reception for Justice Ginsburg. And this was not a totally liberal audience. There were many older G.O.P. donors and corporate types there. This was a spontaneous, bipartisan expression of respect for, and longing for, a national leader of integrity and humility — after three years of a president utterly without shame, for whom no ethical red line has been too red to cross.

There is still a civic pulse in this country. Some Americans still support President Trump, but far, far more are exhausted and disgusted by him. And that is why his latest outrage is so dangerous to him. He knows that we know that many Republicans know that he committed an impeachable offense. And it’s all out there now: a whistle-blower complaint filed by a C.I.A. officer detailing how Trump dangled military assistance in front of the president of Ukraine if he would do Trump a “favor” and investigate bogus corruption charges against Joe Biden."

For months, Republicans gloated as Democrats agonized and squabbled over the question of impeaching President Trump. Should they? Dare they? Did the congressional investigations already taking place qualify as an impeachment inquiry? Grappling with a decision so monumental, and politically risky, the Democratic Party threatened to tear itself apart.

Then came last week’s announcement by Speaker Nancy Pelosi that a formal impeachment investigation was moving forward in the House. Faster than you can say “whistle-blower,” the dynamic flipped. Democrats united behind the message that Mr. Trump, in soliciting a foreign government’s help to undermine one of his domestic political rivals, had left them no choice but to pursue such an inquiry. Republicans struggled to respond, with some of their arguments more creative — and coherent — than others. Among their efforts:

Senator Lindsey Graham opted for a hard brushback: “To impeach any president over a phone call like this would be insane,” he told CNN last Wednesday, referring to the July 25 conversation between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. “There is no there there,” he insisted on Fox News hours later, warning that “if this is an impeachable offense — this phone call — God help the next person to be president of the United States.”

The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, tried a gentler version of this on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” saying he interpreted the call as “two leaders having admiration, not intimidation.”

Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, turned the tables, accusing House Democrats of trying to “intimidate, bully and treat improperly” five State Department officials called to give depositions starting this week on the Ukraine affair."

Just five days earlier, Mr. Putin’s spokesman had said the Kremlin would not want records of the two presidents’ talks released. But Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. spy, said his previous job had taught him that any conversation he had could be published.

“Therefore, when they tried to spin another scandal over our meeting with President Trump in Helsinki, we told the administration directly: If someone wants to find out something, publish; we are not against it,” the Russian president said at an energy conference in Moscow. “I can assure you there was nothing there that could compromise President Trump.”

The message, according to Steven A. Linick, the department’s inspector general, was that he needed to meet — and right away — with senior congressional staff members to give them copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine. He signaled that they could be relevant to the House investigation into whether President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden.

Some Democrats prepared for an explosive revelation that might show top administration officials had tried to obstruct their work. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told lawmakers on a caucus conference call that news reports were confirming that the heart of the briefing was about the White House retaliating against State Department staff who complied with the investigation. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called Mr. Linick’s request “significant” and told lawmakers to “stay tuned.”

So what congressional aides received — a roughly 40-page packet of documents sheathed in a manila envelope decorated with cursive script and manipulated to look aged, with a return address portraying that it had come from the White House — may have been a bit of a letdown."

The larger and wealthier the republic, the greater the challenge, because the republic’s officials must live and move and work in an atmosphere of commercial wealth and foreign lucre — which creates not only direct temptation but also, more subtly, a fear that you are failing your family, your children, if you remain unbought.

The Roman republic in its waning years managed this tension by creating a zone of self-enrichment that was outside the res publica. The public-spirited Roman served the republic in the city of Rome and then got rich somewhere else, far away and out of sight. You climbed the cursus honorum, you reached the office of praetor or consul, you governed honorably and ably (at least in theory), and then your reward was to become a provincial governor and have the chance to squeeze the inhabitants of Hispania Ulterior or Gallia Narbonensis for every last denarius — subject only to occasional prosecution for “abuses” if you made the wrong enemies back home.

The American republic, more idealistic and less brutal than its Roman antecedent, doesn’t send former cabinet officials and senators off to practice extractive taxation everywhere that we have military bases. Instead, we’ve developed a more complicated interplay between public service and private enrichment, a labyrinthine system of consultancies and adviserships and directorates and boards in which the dedicated public servant can make enough money to keep up with the cost of tuition at Sidwell or Exeter without ever taking anything so embarrassing as a bribe.

The ideological grease in this system is the belief that the American businessman, the American soldier and the American diplomat are all fundamentally doing the same work, expanding the Pax Americana one newly opened market, one toppled strongman and one baby democracy at a time. So why shouldn’t our public servants move back and forth between these realms — selling arms to our allies one day, serving on a do-gooding foundation funded by allies and defense contractors the next, helping those allies lobby our government the day after that? After all, all these projects serve the same goal: A world of capitalist democracies at peace with one another, free to get rich under the umbrella of the American military."

Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer.

Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate.

“Look, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it’s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,” he said. “But I’ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.”

The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to “look into” Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son’s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump’s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden’s candidacy.

While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight — even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump’s focus on the Bidens.

That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president’s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden’s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued.

During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers."

Will Warren Top Him?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/democrats-q3-fundraising-numbers.html,"This weekend, top Biden donors and bundlers have been invited to a retreat in Philadelphia to discuss the campaign’s next phase.

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

Mr. Volker replied: “That’s the clear message so far …”

Under questioning on Capitol Hill, Mr. Volker told House Democratic investigators that the language including specific references to Burisma and the 2016 election had come from Mr. Giuliani, the person familiar with his testimony said.

Mr. Volker told the House investigators that the Ukrainians had earlier proposed language promising a statement on fighting corruption that did not specifically mention Burisma and 2016. When Mr. Giuliani was shown that original language, Mr. Volker told the House, he indicated to Mr. Volker that it was not sufficient and said the Ukrainians should be asked for specific public commitments to investigate Burisma and 2016.

By Mr. Volker’s account, according to the person familiar with his testimony, he was eventually told by Mr. Yermak that the Ukrainian government could not agree to the language being sought by Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Volker told Mr. Yermak that he was right, and the idea was dropped, according to the account Mr. Volker provided the House.

The idea behind the statement was to break the Ukrainians of their habit of promising American diplomats and leaders behind closed doors that they would look into matters and never follow through, the people briefed on it said. According to the account provided by Mr. Volker to the House, the idea of the Ukrainians providing a statement had originated with Mr. Giuliani in a conversation he had with Mr. Yermak.

It is unclear if the statement was delivered to Mr. Zelensky, but no statement was released publicly under his name. Around that time, the Ukrainian officials indicated to the Americans that they wanted to avoid becoming more deeply enmeshed in American politics.

The drafting of the statement, which came in the weeks after the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, was an effort to pacify Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani and to normalize relations between the two countries as Ukraine faced continuing conflict with Russia. Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker believed that Mr. Giuliani was “poisoning” Mr. Trump’s mind about Ukraine and that eliciting a public commitment from Mr. Zelensky to pursue the investigations would induce Mr. Trump to more fully support the new Ukrainian government, according to the people familiar with it."

Now he is caught in the middle of a domestic one . He will be pressed to explain what he knew — after acknowledging that he listened in on a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky — and how he reacted when he heard his boss seek political help.

“I was on the phone call,” he said Wednesday, but ignored a question about what he thought about Mr. Trump’s requests.

That admission was a marked change. In interviews in recent weeks, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly evaded questions about the content of the call between the two presidents, and never volunteered that he had listened in.

In an interview on Sept. 22, days before the White House released a transcript of the call, Mr. Pompeo suggested that he was unaware of the details, telling Martha Raddatz of ABC that he had not seen the whistle-blower report and then describing American policy toward Ukraine in traditional terms, without reference to the favors Mr. Trump sought.

The Benghazi hearings that first brought national attention to Mr. Pompeo, then a conservative congressman from Kansas, investigated systematic security failings after four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed in an attack on a diplomatic outpost and a nearby C.I.A. annex in 2012. The two-year congressional inquiry — one of the most bitterly partisan in history — concluded that the State Department and the C.I.A. did not appreciate the high security risk in Benghazi, but found no evidence that Mrs. Clinton was directly to blame.

Like the Benghazi hearings, the impeachment proceedings, opened last week by House Democrats, are as immersed in diplomacy as they are in political intrigue. In recent days Mr. Pompeo’s role in the Ukraine chain of events has become increasingly clearer — and ever closer to the center of the controversy."

The forum, sponsored by two gun control organizations and MSNBC, was intended as a platform for a policy discussion — but it quickly became an outlet for rising anxiety among Democrats who fear the country has grown numb to mass shootings, like the ones that took place during a single August weekend in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio.

“It’s not an intellectual issue,” said Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, speaking to an audience that included the families of some shooting victims. “This is living with a sense of urgency. We cannot wait. This is no time for an impotence of empathy. We cannot wait until this hell is upon your community for you to be activated in this fight.”

Ergo, the more governments that Mr. Trump urges to do the same thing, the more normal, if not public-spirited, such aberrant presidential behavior will seem. The cynical marketing calculation — Mr. Trump’s favorite form of math — would seem to be that, as with previous administration outrages, the news media will grow weary, the public will grow numb, the Democratic inquisitors will appear ineffectual. Mr. Trump is also, of course, seeking to drag former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, down to his level and implicate them in the same kind of self-dealing that he and his own family stand accused of.

This might work. But it also might not. There is no historical precedent for a president demanding that a foreign government investigate another American politician. If Mr. Trump has evidence of possible corruption overseas, his counsel should relay it to the Department of Justice and let the F.B.I. do its job, in coordination with its foreign counterparts.

Instead, Mr. Trump used his telephone conversation with Mr. Zelensky to pressure him to do Mr. Trump a “favor” and consult with Rudy Giuliani, serving as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer and unofficial envoy, and the attorney general, William Barr, about digging up dirt on the Bidens. At that time, the United States, under direct orders from the president, was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid appropriated by Congress to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian encroachment on its eastern border.

Much remains unknown about how the various dots do or do not connect. But basic facts of the Ukraine approach are not in dispute. Nor can there be much question about what Mr. Trump so publicly asked China to do.

There is a certain twisted logic to the president’s approach.

Thanks to a nearly $25 million fund-raising bounty in the spring, which he topped up with a respectable $19.1 million over the summer, as reported Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg has been able to invest in a gold-plated ground game in Iowa as he seeks to challenge two candidates who have been organizing for longer here, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .

“We’re entering the stage where the rubber meets the road,” Mr. Buttigieg said in an interview as his four-day trip wrapped up last week. “ In order to settle the question of electability , the best thing you can do is perform well in an actual election. Iowa’s of course the first. And so that’s where a lot of our focus is going to go.”

Grass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night. The Buttigieg campaign, which opened its bus tour to live-tweeting journalists in an effort to set itself apart, is also road-testing a somewhat novel approach to organizing.

The recall of Marie Yovanovitch in the spring has become a key point of interest in the House impeachment inquiry. A whistleblower complaint by a CIA officer alleges the president solicited foreign interference in the 2020 elections by pressing Ukraine’s president in a July 25 call to pursue investigations, including into the activities of Mr. Biden, a Democrat who is running for president.

The complaint cites Ms. Yovanovitch’s ouster as one of a series of events that paved the way for what the whistleblower alleges was an abuse of power by the president. Mr. Trump has described the call with his Ukrainian counterpart as “perfect” and the House inquiry as a “hoax.”

State Department officials were told this spring that Ms. Yovanovitch’s removal was a priority for the president, a person familiar with the matter said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo supported the move, an administration official said. Ms. Yovanovitch was told by State Department officials that they couldn’t shield her from attacks by the president and his allies, according to people close to her.

In an interview, Mr. Giuliani told The Wall Street Journal that in the lead-up to Ms. Yovanovitch’s removal, he reminded the president of complaints percolating among Trump supporters that she had displayed an anti-Trump bias in private conversations. In Mr. Giuliani’s view, she also had been an obstacle to efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter.

As vice president, Mr. Biden spearheaded an international anticorruption reform push in Ukraine, which included calling for the dismissal of a prosecutor the U.S. and its allies saw as soft on corruption. He had once investigated the Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board at a salary of $50,000 a month, according to one official with ties to the company. Mr. Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption.

In May, Ukraine’s then-prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.

When Ms. Yovanovitch left her post in May, the State Department said she was concluding her assignment “as planned,” and that her departure date aligned with the start of a new administration in Ukraine. She was recalled at least three months before the end of the customary three-year diplomatic tenure.

Mr. Giuliani told the Journal that when he mentioned the ambassador to the president this spring, Mr. Trump “remembered he had a problem with her earlier and thought she had been dismissed.” Mr. Giuliani said he subsequently received a call from a White House official—whom he declined to identify—asking him to list his concerns about the ambassador again.

President Trump’s efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden have set off an impeachment inquiry. WSJ’s Shelby Holliday lays out a timeline of interactions between the president’s inner circle and Ukrainian officials.

Mr. Giuliani said he gave Mr. Pompeo a nine-page document dated March 28 that included a detailed timeline of the Bidens’ dealings in Ukraine and allegations of impropriety against Ms. Yovanovitch, including that she was “very close” to Mr. Biden.

“He called me back and he said they were going to investigate,” Mr. Giuliani said of the secretary of state, saying Mr. Pompeo asked for additional documents to back up the allegations. “The reason I gave the information to the secretary was I believed that he should know that the president’s orders to fire her were being blocked by the State Department.”

Neither the State Department nor the White House responded to requests for comment.

Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said Mr. Biden has professional respect for Ms. Yovanovitch but that the two aren’t close. “She became our ambassador during the final 6 months of the administration,” he said. “This is standard Rudy Giuliani: noun, verb, lie about Joe Biden. ”

When asked about Ms. Yovanovitch’s removal Thursday, Mr. Trump told reporters: “I don’t know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her but I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time. Not good.”

Ms. Yovanovitch couldn’t be reached for comment. She is set to testify before House lawmakers on Oct. 11 as part of the impeachment inquiry. People close to her disputed that she did anything wrong and defended her work.

“She was doing everything by the book,” said a senior Ukraine government official who interacted with her. “Everything was blessed by State Department.”

Ms. Yovanovitch remains an employee of the State Department and is a senior State Department fellow at Georgetown University.

A career diplomat, she first served as the second-ranking diplomat in Kyiv in 2001 under President George W. Bush and returned as ambassador under President Obama in 2016.

Prior to Ms. Yovanovitch’s recall from Kyiv, her relations with some senior Ukrainian officials were fraught. Ms. Yovanovitch openly criticized the office of Mr. Lutsenko, then the prosecutor general, for its poor anticorruption record. “Lutsenko hated her because she pushed for reforms, especially in the judiciary sector,” said a former Western diplomat in Ukraine.

Presidents have the authority to nominate and remove ambassadors. But some senior officials at the White House and State Department say they had been unaware of the president’s displeasure with Ms. Yovanovitch and surprised by her removal.

Mr. Giuliani’s role in pressing for the ambassador’s ouster is unusual given that he holds no formal government role. The president’s critics contend that, in his capacity representing the president’s personal interests as his attorney, he has exercised undue influence over administration policy and personnel.

Mr. Giuliani isn’t the only figure outside the administration to have expressed concerns about the ambassador. As early as the spring of 2018, Pete Sessions, at the time a GOP congressman from Texas, sent a letter to Mr. Pompeo asking for her removal, saying he had been told Ms. Yovanovitch was displaying a bias against the president in private conversations.

Mr. Sessions told the Journal he didn’t follow up on the matter and didn’t hear until months later about Mr. Trump’s interest in replacing her. He declined to say where his information about the ambassador came from but said his letter was in line with a broader concern among members of Congress that the administration wasn’t moving swiftly enough to put new ambassadors in place.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should career diplomats reflect a president’s political interests or be shielded from them as they represent the U.S. abroad? Join the conversation below.

In a March 2019 interview with a columnist at The Hill, Mr. Lutsenko complained that the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv was obstructing corruption investigations, including by providing a “do not prosecute” list and restricting Ukrainian access to the U.S. Mr. Lutsenko’s claim is mentioned in the whistleblower complaint.

The U.S. State Department at the time called the untouchables list claim an “outright fabrication.” Mr. Lutsenko later retracted the allegation about the list and said had no evidence of Biden wrongdoing. He was dismissed in August.

In early 2019, Mr. Lutsenko met twice with Mr. Giuliani, who around the same time stepped up his quest to collect information he could use to persuade Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens. The men met in New York in January and in Warsaw in February.

Mr. Lutsenko couldn’t be reached for comment. Mr. Giuliani said he brought concerns about the ambassador to the president in the weeks following his meetings with Mr. Lutsenko. “It would have been a dereliction of my duty if I didn’t,” he said. He accused Ms. Yovanovitch of blocking his efforts to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens: “I think she covered it up.”

The president’s supporters kept up criticism of Ms. Yovanovitch. In a March 22 interview on Fox News, Joe diGenova, a lawyer close to the president, accused Ms. Yovanovitch, without providing evidence, of having “bad-mouthed” Mr. Trump to Ukrainian officials and having told them “not to listen or worry about Trump policy because he’s going to be impeached.”

Mr. diGenova declined to comment. In the Fox interview, Mr. diGenova added: “The president has ordered her dismissal from her post.” The same month, Donald Trump Jr. , the president’s son, referred to the ambassador in a Twitter message as a “joker.”

After Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian presidency on April 21, State Department officials told their Ukrainian counterparts that they favored continuity at the embassy in Kyiv, rather than inserting a new ambassador, according to people familiar with the matter.

Instead, Ms. Yovanovitch was recalled about two weeks after the election. The State Department hasn’t named a successor.

In the July 25 call, Mr. Trump described Ms. Yovanovitch to Mr. Zelensky as “bad news.” Mr. Zelensky responded: ”It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%.”

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed for the first time Wednesday that he listened in on the phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that prompted a House impeachment inquiry.

In early May, a packet of materials was received by Mr. Pompeo’s office at the State Department, according to an account given Wednesday to House and Senate committee members by the State Department inspector general and later described by Democratic lawmakers. The inspector general told Congress he had information relevant to the impeachment investigation. The inspector general didn’t respond to requests for comment.

It contained several folders marked “Trump Hotel” containing notes and newspaper clippings Democratic lawmakers said were designed to smear Ms. Yovanovitch, packaged in an envelope marked “White House,” according to documents viewed by the Journal.

“It is a package of propaganda and disinformation and conspiracy theories,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.).

The nine-page document Mr. Giuliani said he gave to Mr. Pompeo dated March 28 was part of that packet, according to a person who saw the packet.

But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years.

Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition — concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.

“I was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,” Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.

None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he “was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,” a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February.

With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden’s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age.

“He’s not as sharp as he might be,” said Carol Sobelson, 63, at a campaign event in Concord, N.H. “He’s done a lot for our country, he was a great vice president. He’s probably not my first choice.”"

For months, Republicans gloated as Democrats agonized and squabbled over the question of impeaching President Trump. Should they? Dare they? Did the congressional investigations already taking place qualify as an impeachment inquiry? Grappling with a decision so monumental, and politically risky, the Democratic Party threatened to tear itself apart.

Then came last week’s announcement by Speaker Nancy Pelosi that a formal impeachment investigation was moving forward in the House. Faster than you can say “whistle-blower,” the dynamic flipped. Democrats united behind the message that Mr. Trump, in soliciting a foreign government’s help to undermine one of his domestic political rivals, had left them no choice but to pursue such an inquiry. Republicans struggled to respond, with some of their arguments more creative — and coherent — than others. Among their efforts:

Senator Lindsey Graham opted for a hard brushback: “To impeach any president over a phone call like this would be insane,” he told CNN last Wednesday, referring to the July 25 conversation between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. “There is no there there,” he insisted on Fox News hours later, warning that “if this is an impeachable offense — this phone call — God help the next person to be president of the United States.”

The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, tried a gentler version of this on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” saying he interpreted the call as “two leaders having admiration, not intimidation.”

Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, turned the tables, accusing House Democrats of trying to “intimidate, bully and treat improperly” five State Department officials called to give depositions starting this week on the Ukraine affair."

Putin of Russia said on Wednesday that he would not mind if the White House made public his talks with President Trump at a summit meeting last year, because there was nothing incriminating in their conversations.

Just five days earlier, Mr. Putin’s spokesman had said the Kremlin would not want records of the two presidents’ talks released. But Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. spy, said his previous job had taught him that any conversation he had could be published.

“Therefore, when they tried to spin another scandal over our meeting with President Trump in Helsinki, we told the administration directly: If someone wants to find out something, publish; we are not against it,” the Russian president said at an energy conference in Moscow. “I can assure you there was nothing there that could compromise President Trump.”

The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Friday that Moscow would not want to see Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Putin’s conversations made public, amid the uproar caused by the White House’s release of an account of a call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine."

Biden Jr. and his son Hunter appears to center on a joint venture that involved the younger Mr. Biden and some of China’s leading state-owned financial companies.

But the president’s claims bear little if any relation to the known facts.

Without presenting any evidence, Mr. Trump suggested on Thursday that China showered $1.5 billion on Hunter Biden in order to influence his father and win favorable trade deals with the United States.

“That’s probably why China for so many years has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the U.S.A.” because they deal with people like “Biden where they give the son a billion and a half dollars,” Mr. Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. He added: “You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.”

Companies associated with Hunter Biden or his business partners have struck several deals involving China over the past decade. So, in fact, have Mr. Trump’s own relatives — a point that Mr. Trump does not mention in his now almost-daily accusations against the former vice president, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son."

Here’s a fact check of his remarks.

What President Trump Said

“And then Schiff went up and he got, as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn’t take place. He made up the language. Hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown. But he went up to the microphone and he read a statement from the president of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is when he looked at the sheet — which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this — exact, word for word, he said, ‘Wow, he didn’t do anything wrong.’ So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the president of the United States never said.”

False.

For days, Mr. Trump has criticized statements made by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, during a congressional hearing last week about the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. That call is part of a whistle-blower complaint that led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry.

The president, who often misquotes others, has repeatedly accused Mr. Schiff of “treason” and committing a “crime” for the way he presented the call. He escalated those attacks by claiming, without evidence, that Mr. Schiff had decided to fabricate the conversation after realizing that Mr. Trump “didn’t do anything wrong.”

Mr. Schiff did not claim to be reciting from a reconstructed transcript of the call and said he was conferring “the essence” of the conversation. But he did speak in first person, leaving an impression that he was quoting Mr. Trump. Later in the hearing, Mr. Schiff said that his “summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least part in parody.”"

The message, according to Steven A. Linick, the department’s inspector general, was that he needed to meet — and right away — with senior congressional staff members to give them copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine. He signaled that they could be relevant to the House investigation into whether President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden.

Some Democrats prepared for an explosive revelation that might show top administration officials had tried to obstruct their work. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told lawmakers on a caucus conference call that news reports were confirming that the heart of the briefing was about the White House retaliating against State Department staff who complied with the investigation. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called Mr. Linick’s request “significant” and told lawmakers to “stay tuned.”

So what congressional aides received — a roughly 40-page packet of documents sheathed in a manila envelope decorated with cursive script and manipulated to look aged, with a return address portraying that it had come from the White House — may have been a bit of a letdown."

Biden Jr. as well, an extraordinary request for help from a foreign power that could benefit him in next year’s election.

“ China should start an investigation into the Bidens , because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House to travel to Florida. His request came just moments after he discussed upcoming trade talks with China and said that “if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous power.”

The president’s call for Chinese intervention means that Mr. Trump and his attorney general have now solicited assistance in discrediting the president’s political opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and, according to one report, Britain. In speaking so publicly on Thursday, a defiant Mr. Trump pushed back against critics who have called such requests an abuse of power, essentially arguing that there was nothing wrong with seeking foreign help to fight corruption.

Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has made little effort to hide actions or statements that critics called outrageous violations of norms and standards. And yet because he does them in public, they seem to stir less blowback than if they had been done behind closed doors. Among other things, he repeatedly called on his own Justice Department to investigate his Democratic foes and eventually fired his first attorney general for not protecting him from the Russia investigation."
39,Katie Glueck,"Last quarter, Mr. Biden pulled in$22 million, one of the biggest hauls in the field for that time period, though he still fell behind Mr. Buttigieg for that quarter.

Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer.

Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate.

“Look, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it’s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,” he said. “But I’ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.”

The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to “look into” Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son’s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump’s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden’s candidacy.

While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight — even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump’s focus on the Bidens.

That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president’s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden’s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued.

During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers."

In his decades-long public life, Mr. Trump has continually said things that shock (“Russia, if you’re listening …”). But today’s open request for China to investigate his political adversary still felt like new territory.

Maggie, why would he just blurt out that he wants China to investigate the Bidens?

He clearly knows something a wise person once said to me, which is that the value of a secret is its ability to be disclosed. So he tries to move the window of acceptability by publicly doing the very thing he is accused of doing in private.

What is it about his circumstances that might encourage him to make a request like this out loud?

He has led a consequence-free life despite enormously self-destructive behaviors over time. The divorces were marriages he wanted out of. The bankruptcies impacted his lenders most, not him. All of his behavior in 2016 ended with him winning the presidency. And the Mueller obstruction inquiry ended with no definitive answer.

Does his request this morning remind you of anything?

The period of time that is the most illuminating happened after the “Access Hollywood” tape came out. The next day, I wrote a story about Mr. Trump holed up at Trump Tower. He came downstairs sometime after 4 p.m. and went and immersed himself in a crowd of supporters who were outside on the street, and pumped his fist. The next day, he went to the debate in St. Louis and paraded Bill Clinton’s accusers in front of Hillary Clinton. It was the most savage thing I had ever seen anyone do in politics. And it underscored what Mr. Trump does when he is wounded."

This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health,” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

In a show of force, the campaign announced a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa that it then postponed as it waited to assess the situation; the ad will now begin airing next Tuesday, and will run for two weeks as planned."

Mr. Volker replied: “That’s the clear message so far …”

Under questioning on Capitol Hill, Mr. Volker told House Democratic investigators that the language including specific references to Burisma and the 2016 election had come from Mr. Giuliani, the person familiar with his testimony said.

Mr. Volker told the House investigators that the Ukrainians had earlier proposed language promising a statement on fighting corruption that did not specifically mention Burisma and 2016. When Mr. Giuliani was shown that original language, Mr. Volker told the House, he indicated to Mr. Volker that it was not sufficient and said the Ukrainians should be asked for specific public commitments to investigate Burisma and 2016.

By Mr. Volker’s account, according to the person familiar with his testimony, he was eventually told by Mr. Yermak that the Ukrainian government could not agree to the language being sought by Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Volker told Mr. Yermak that he was right, and the idea was dropped, according to the account Mr. Volker provided the House.

The idea behind the statement was to break the Ukrainians of their habit of promising American diplomats and leaders behind closed doors that they would look into matters and never follow through, the people briefed on it said. According to the account provided by Mr. Volker to the House, the idea of the Ukrainians providing a statement had originated with Mr. Giuliani in a conversation he had with Mr. Yermak.

It is unclear if the statement was delivered to Mr. Zelensky, but no statement was released publicly under his name. Around that time, the Ukrainian officials indicated to the Americans that they wanted to avoid becoming more deeply enmeshed in American politics.

The drafting of the statement, which came in the weeks after the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, was an effort to pacify Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani and to normalize relations between the two countries as Ukraine faced continuing conflict with Russia. Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker believed that Mr. Giuliani was “poisoning” Mr. Trump’s mind about Ukraine and that eliciting a public commitment from Mr. Zelensky to pursue the investigations would induce Mr. Trump to more fully support the new Ukrainian government, according to the people familiar with it."
43,Peter Baker,"I edited the draft statement by Mr. Yermak to include these points to see how it looked, Mr. Volker testified, referring to Andrey Yermak, a top adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, demanded that Ukraine specifically commit to investigate involvement in the 2016 election and a firm tied to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

During testimony behind closed doors on Thursday, the special envoy, Kurt D. Volker, said Mr. Giuliani rejected a generic draft statement that Ukraine’s government had agreed to issue committing to fighting corruption generally. Instead, Mr. Giuliani said the Ukrainians had to promise to pursue two specific investigations that could damage the president’s political domestic adversaries.

While Mr. Giuliani’s efforts to pressure Ukraine have been known, Mr. Volker’s account to House committees conducting an impeachment inquiry provides new details about how the president’s personal lawyer inserted himself into foreign policy to benefit Mr. Trump politically. Not only was Mr. Giuliani meeting with Ukrainian officials, he was effectively dictating the contents of a statement being negotiated by State Department officials with a foreign power.

Mr. Giuliani “said that in his view, the statement should include specific reference to ‘Burisma’ and ‘2016,’” Mr. Volker told the House investigators, according to a copy of his prepared testimony provided by a person involved in the process who did not want to be named. “There was no mention of Vice President Biden in these conversations.”"

Ergo, the more governments that Mr. Trump urges to do the same thing, the more normal, if not public-spirited, such aberrant presidential behavior will seem. The cynical marketing calculation — Mr. Trump’s favorite form of math — would seem to be that, as with previous administration outrages, the news media will grow weary, the public will grow numb, the Democratic inquisitors will appear ineffectual. Mr. Trump is also, of course, seeking to drag former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, down to his level and implicate them in the same kind of self-dealing that he and his own family stand accused of.

This might work. But it also might not. There is no historical precedent for a president demanding that a foreign government investigate another American politician. If Mr. Trump has evidence of possible corruption overseas, his counsel should relay it to the Department of Justice and let the F.B.I. do its job, in coordination with its foreign counterparts.

Instead, Mr. Trump used his telephone conversation with Mr. Zelensky to pressure him to do Mr. Trump a “favor” and consult with Rudy Giuliani, serving as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer and unofficial envoy, and the attorney general, William Barr, about digging up dirt on the Bidens. At that time, the United States, under direct orders from the president, was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid appropriated by Congress to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian encroachment on its eastern border.

Much remains unknown about how the various dots do or do not connect. But basic facts of the Ukraine approach are not in dispute. Nor can there be much question about what Mr. Trump so publicly asked China to do.

There is a certain twisted logic to the president’s approach.

Thanks to a nearly $25 million fund-raising bounty in the spring, which he topped up with a respectable $19.1 million over the summer, as reported Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg has been able to invest in a gold-plated ground game in Iowa as he seeks to challenge two candidates who have been organizing for longer here, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .

“We’re entering the stage where the rubber meets the road,” Mr. Buttigieg said in an interview as his four-day trip wrapped up last week. “ In order to settle the question of electability , the best thing you can do is perform well in an actual election. Iowa’s of course the first. And so that’s where a lot of our focus is going to go.”

Grass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night. The Buttigieg campaign, which opened its bus tour to live-tweeting journalists in an effort to set itself apart, is also road-testing a somewhat novel approach to organizing. Its Iowa volunteers first contact friends and family members rather than cold-calling lists of registered voters, who are now so bombarded they ignore unknown numbers."

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

Mr. Trump and his advisers have begun looking for ways to find a compromise with China that would forestall another round of tariffs on Chinese goods that are scheduled for later this year, and perhaps roll back some of the existing tariffs, people with knowledge of the White House’s strategy said. The United States has already placed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. It plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30 percent on Oct. 15 and impose more levies in December.

Chinese officials have scaled back their expectations for eliminating American tariffs by quietly dropping earlier public demands that any deal must immediately get rid of all of Mr. Trump’s levies. They have also resumed buying American farm goods as a good-will gesture to help establish a negotiating environment in which an initial deal may be possible.

Still, an agreement is far from guaranteed. Both sides have come close to a deal in the past, including in May, only to have it fall apart at the last moment and tip the countries back into an escalating trade war.

Mr. Trump and his advisers have insisted they are still pushing for a comprehensive deal that would require Beijing to loosen state control over China’s economy. However, they have also discussed scenarios in which they would ease tariffs on roughly a third of the $360 billion worth of Chinese goods penalized so far and delay further tariff increases, in return for concessions on intellectual property, substantial agricultural purchases and other benefits, people familiar with the matter said.

It is far from clear whether either Mr. Trump or Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, would agree to any interim compromise, or that the two sides’ top negotiators could find enough common ground to work toward an initial deal when they meet next week. Even if they do, the broader trade war would continue to rage, leaving in place American tariffs on at least $250 billion in Chinese goods, plus some of Beijing’s retaliatory measures on American farm products and other imports.

But economic and political pressure is growing on both sides to ease the trade war. China’s growth continues to slow, while American farm exports have slumped. Manufacturing in the United States continues to contract as businesses express concern about the uncertainty posed by the trade fight. Farmers and rural voters largely continue to back Mr. Trump, but their support is beginning to waver, and the president is eager to shore up that vote heading into the 2020 campaign."

But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years.

Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition — concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.

“I was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,” Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.

None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he “was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,” a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February.

With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden’s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age.

Biden Jr. and his son Hunter appears to center on a joint venture that involved the younger Mr. Biden and some of China’s leading state-owned financial companies.

But the president’s claims bear little if any relation to the known facts.

Without presenting any evidence, Mr. Trump suggested on Thursday that China showered $1.5 billion on Hunter Biden in order to influence his father and win favorable trade deals with the United States.

“That’s probably why China for so many years has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the U.S.A.” because they deal with people like “Biden where they give the son a billion and a half dollars,” Mr. Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. He added: “You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.”

Companies associated with Hunter Biden or his business partners have struck several deals involving China over the past decade.

Here’s a fact check of his remarks.

What President Trump Said

“And then Schiff went up and he got, as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn’t take place. He made up the language. Hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown. But he went up to the microphone and he read a statement from the president of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is when he looked at the sheet — which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this — exact, word for word, he said, ‘Wow, he didn’t do anything wrong.’ So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the president of the United States never said.”

False.

For days, Mr. Trump has criticized statements made by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, during a congressional hearing last week about the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. That call is part of a whistle-blower complaint that led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry.

The president, who often misquotes others, has repeatedly accused Mr. Schiff of “treason” and committing a “crime” for the way he presented the call. He escalated those attacks by claiming, without evidence, that Mr. Schiff had decided to fabricate the conversation after realizing that Mr. Trump “didn’t do anything wrong.”

Mr. Schiff did not claim to be reciting from a reconstructed transcript of the call and said he was conferring “the essence” of the conversation. But he did speak in first person, leaving an impression that he was quoting Mr. Trump. Later in the hearing, Mr. Schiff said that his “summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least part in parody.”"

But a source in Mr. Pence’s office said that no such trip had been planned.

And when Hurricane Dorian led Mr. Trump to cancel an early-September trip to Warsaw on which he was set to meet with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Pence traveled in place of the president. While there, on Sept. 2, Mr. Pence denied to reporters that he had discussed the elder Mr. Biden with the Ukrainian leader.

“The president asked me to meet with President Zelensky and to talk about the progress that he’s making on a broad range of areas,” Mr. Pence said. “And we did that.”

Mr. Pence did not directly respond to a question at the time about whether the Trump administration had held up $391 million in military aid for the country this summer in order to further pressure Mr. Zelensky’s government. Instead he cited Mr. Trump’s complaint that Europe has not done more to assist Ukraine, adding that “as President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.”

By that time, Mr. Trump’s public remarks had already conflated well-established concerns about endemic corruption in Ukrainian society with his more personalized notion of corruption in the country — namely the alleged activities of the Bidens and unfounded theories that it was Ukraine’s government that meddled in the 2016 election, not Russia’s.

Mr. Pence’s critics say that despite the vice president’s professions of ignorance about the core of Mr. Trump’s political agenda in Ukraine, he knew enough about the president’s mixing of foreign policy and politics to be implicated in any wrongdoing.

At the same time, Mr. Pence appears to have been almost willfully oblivious to Mr. Trump’s public obsession with Ukraine, the Bidens and conspiracy theories surrounding the 2016 election that have also been amplified in public by Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani."

They have tried to signal to Mr. Trump and his allies that the issues will be investigated, even as they tried to telegraph to Democrats that they were not bending to Mr. Trump’s pressure.

At the same time, the prosecutor’s announcement signaled some attention to an issue Mr. Trump raised in the phone call in July and had repeated publicly: a Ukrainian government investigation of a case touching on a likely opponent in next year’s election.

Mr. Trump’s July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is central to the formal House committee impeachment inquiry called by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The inquiry is examining whether Mr. Trump betrayed his oath of office and the nation’s security by seeking to enlist the aid of a foreign power to tarnish a political rival.

On the call, Mr. Zelensky suggested that he would assist with an investigation of Burisma, according to White House notes of the call. The Ukrainian president said that a new prosecutor general would soon be appointed who would be “100 percent my person” and would “look into the situation.”

The Ukrainian president said his country was also almost ready to purchase anti-tank missiles, made by Raytheon, to be used to better repel armored assaults by Russian-supported fighters. Mr. Trump responded, “I’d like you to do us a favor, though.”

Mr. Trump has vigorously denied doing anything wrong, and allies of the president said that a reconstructed transcript of the call showed no quid pro quo, making the impeachment inquiry baseless. But Democrats said that Mr. Trump’s request for a favor, and the fact that he had already withheld millions in aid from Ukraine before the call, raised serious questions that must be examined.

On Thursday, the State Department gave initial approval to the $39.2 million sale of 150 Javelin missiles and related equipment to Ukraine. The sale of the javelins to Ukraine must still go through Congress. Ukraine has been fighting Russia for five years in eastern Ukraine since Moscow’s seizure of Crimea."

Biden Jr. as well, an extraordinary request for help from a foreign power that could benefit him in next year’s election.

“ China should start an investigation into the Bidens , because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House to travel to Florida. His request came just moments after he discussed upcoming trade talks with China and said that “if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous power.”

The president’s call for Chinese intervention means that Mr. Trump and his attorney general have now solicited assistance in discrediting the president’s political opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and, according to one report, Britain. In speaking so publicly on Thursday, a defiant Mr. Trump pushed back against critics who have called such requests an abuse of power, essentially arguing that there was nothing wrong with seeking foreign help to fight corruption.

Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has made little effort to hide actions or statements that critics called outrageous violations of norms and standards. And yet because he does them in public, they seem to stir less blowback than if they had been done behind closed doors. Among other things, he repeatedly called on his own Justice Department to investigate his Democratic foes and eventually fired his first attorney general for not protecting him from the Russia investigation."

In his decades-long public life, Mr. Trump has continually said things that shock (“Russia, if you’re listening …”). But today’s open request for China to investigate his political adversary still felt like new territory.

Maggie, why would he just blurt out that he wants China to investigate the Bidens?

He clearly knows something a wise person once said to me, which is that the value of a secret is its ability to be disclosed. So he tries to move the window of acceptability by publicly doing the very thing he is accused of doing in private.

What is it about his circumstances that might encourage him to make a request like this out loud?

He has led a consequence-free life despite enormously self-destructive behaviors over time. The divorces were marriages he wanted out of. The bankruptcies impacted his lenders most, not him. All of his behavior in 2016 ended with him winning the presidency. And the Mueller obstruction inquiry ended with no definitive answer.

Does his request this morning remind you of anything?

The period of time that is the most illuminating happened after the “Access Hollywood” tape came out. The next day, I wrote a story about Mr. Trump holed up at Trump Tower. He came downstairs sometime after 4 p.m. and went and immersed himself in a crowd of supporters who were outside on the street, and pumped his fist. The next day, he went to the debate in St. Louis and paraded Bill Clinton’s accusers in front of Hillary Clinton. It was the most savage thing I had ever seen anyone do in politics. And it underscored what Mr. Trump does when he is wounded."

This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health,” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

In a show of force, the campaign announced a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa that it then postponed as it waited to assess the situation; the ad will now begin airing next Tuesday, and will run for two weeks as planned."

Not only was Mr. Giuliani meeting with Ukrainian officials, he was effectively dictating the contents of a statement being negotiated by State Department officials with a foreign power.

Mr. Giuliani “said that in his view, the statement should include specific reference to ‘Burisma’ and ‘2016,’” Mr. Volker told the House investigators, according to a copy of his prepared testimony provided by a person involved in the process who did not want to be named. “There was no mention of Vice President Biden in these conversations.”"

The two biggest disasters in Trump’s presidency have both been cases where these guardrails collapsed, and the president actually got his way in full. He actually fired James Comey, setting in motion the probe whose workings dominated his first term, and his Homeland Security apparatus actually separated thousands of migrant children from their families, creating the biggest moral scandal of his presidency.

But in other cases he has been protected by the “don’t-give-him-the-alligator” operations all around him. Indeed, the ultimate fizzle of the Mueller report was possible because that report ended up documenting a president whose staff let him rant about obstructing justice, but then — in Mueller’s own words — mostly “declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”

With the Ukraine scandal, though, this protection has broken down again. (Not least because in Rudy Giuliani, Trump found an adviser even more enthusiastic about alligators than his boss.) The quest to get Ukraine’s government to reopen an investigation that would touch the Biden family wasn’t just a wish that Trump expressed; it was a policy objective that, however reluctantly and haphazardly, the U.S. government seems to have pursued. Trump’s now-publicized conversation with the Ukrainian president was itself an act of foreign policy, not just a spitballing conversation, and, whatever its intentions, so was the delay of military aid. We can’t see the full body of the alligator, but you can see it moving in the water; it’s right there.

Now clearly people around Trump still believed that they weren’t going all the way to Alligatortown with Rudy, and maybe when we see the full shape of things it will be clear that the president’s men did actually prevent the most explicitly Biden-focused quid pro quo from taking shape. In which case there will be defenses of Trump that say, in effect: Look, he wanted an alligator, and we let one thrash around in the water for a while, but we always kept it on a leash.

I expect that will be the defense offered, eventually, by pained Republican senators voting to acquit — that this was bad behavior but happily the president’s diplomats kept things from reaching the level of an impeachable offense.

The only difficulty will be that Trumpland will probably spend the next few months making a different argument: Actually, alligators are great.

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

There was a time, just months ago even, when a foreign country interfering in America’s elections would have been impermissible by law and unacceptable to the people. The rules of our democracy have changed.

President Trump — who brands himself as a new kind of nationalist (without the historical baggage that term lugs around) — has now turned to the global elite to help him win re-election. Forget George Soros, the Bilderbergs and cosmopolitan consensus. Donald J. Trump has pushed globalism to new, glittering heights. Free trade? Please. Try inviting the world to do everything short of casting a ballot. Not even QAnon could have seen this twist coming.

On Thursday, the president again asked Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, to investigate one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump went on to ask the same of Xi Jinping, preoccupied though the Chinese leader is at the moment with trying to suffocate a democratic uprising in Hong Kong. A Republican on the White House lawn asking Communist China for help in winning a democratic election isn’t something that prognosticators would have picked for 2019. But that’s where the United States finds itself.

Mr. Trump and his advisers have begun looking for ways to find a compromise with China that would forestall another round of tariffs on Chinese goods that are scheduled for later this year, and perhaps roll back some of the existing tariffs, people with knowledge of the White House’s strategy said. The United States has already placed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. It plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30 percent on Oct. 15 and impose more levies in December.

Chinese officials have scaled back their expectations for eliminating American tariffs by quietly dropping earlier public demands that any deal must immediately get rid of all of Mr. Trump’s levies. They have also resumed buying American farm goods as a good-will gesture to help establish a negotiating environment in which an initial deal may be possible.

Still, an agreement is far from guaranteed. Both sides have come close to a deal in the past, including in May, only to have it fall apart at the last moment and tip the countries back into an escalating trade war.

Mr. Trump and his advisers have insisted they are still pushing for a comprehensive deal that would require Beijing to loosen state control over China’s economy. However, they have also discussed scenarios in which they would ease tariffs on roughly a third of the $360 billion worth of Chinese goods penalized so far and delay further tariff increases, in return for concessions on intellectual property, substantial agricultural purchases and other benefits, people familiar with the matter said.

It is far from clear whether either Mr. Trump or Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, would agree to any interim compromise, or that the two sides’ top negotiators could find enough common ground to work toward an initial deal when they meet next week. Even if they do, the broader trade war would continue to rage, leaving in place American tariffs on at least $250 billion in Chinese goods, plus some of Beijing’s retaliatory measures on American farm products and other imports.

But economic and political pressure is growing on both sides to ease the trade war. China’s growth continues to slow, while American farm exports have slumped. Manufacturing in the United States continues to contract as businesses express concern about the uncertainty posed by the trade fight. Farmers and rural voters largely continue to back Mr. Trump, but their support is beginning to waver, and the president is eager to shore up that vote heading into the 2020 campaign."

Recalling the difficulty Hillary Clinton had in confronting Mr. Trump’s campaign style, Mr. Biden worried about being “sucked into the trap of the stuff that Trump was laying. He wants you in a mud fight.”

“But when you respond to that,” he continued, “it brings you back down into that.”

Mr. Biden was even blunter, and angrier, in private after news first emerged that Mr. Trump had exhorted the Ukrainian government to investigate him and his son.

“I can’t believe this guy is going after my family like this,” he told Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, as the two campaigned in Iowa, Mr. Coons recalled.

Leading Democrats have been pleading privately with Mr. Biden and his top aides to aggressively confront Mr. Trump, and expressing impatience with them for not seizing this opportunity to engage him in a two-man race. After all, Mr. Biden had spent months framing his candidacy as a singular crusade to oust an aberrant president.

“It’s time to really respond so everybody hears it,” said Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a campaign co-chairman. “If someone says something enough, people will start to believe it, and this president gets in his zone of telling a lie over and over again. You have to make sure people don’t believe in it.”"

This was more than a year into Trump’s presidency, by which point the rationalizations of other supposedly serious conservatives who took top administration jobs no longer held water. It was clear that Trump wasn’t just a few artful nudges away from proper presidential bearing. He couldn’t be lifted up because he was too busy cruelly dragging everyone else down.

But Pompeo had a heady shot at a vaunted job that almost surely wasn’t going to come his way any other time. So he lunged for it, then demonstrated with his obsequiousness that doing good and doing right were never high on the agenda.

He wrote an op-ed article that essentially broke with his fellow Republicans to promote Trump’s view that Saudi Arabia’s butchery of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi shouldn’t give anyone pause. What are a few severed body parts among allies?

He recalled the ambassador to Ukraine just to please the president and his babbling Beelzebub, Rudy Giuliani. He listened mutely to that July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, decided to ignore what he heard and then claimed — until a few days ago — that he was utterly in the dark about any pressure on Ukraine to kneecap Joe Biden.

In Greece on Saturday, he proudly portrayed the Trump administration’s approach to Ukraine as a high-minded vigil against corruption and an attempt to ensure against interference in American elections. In the process he gave fresh currency to a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential race.

Had he spoken up about the phone call or pushed back, he would have risked ending up on the outside, among the swelling Trump administration diaspora. He preferred the inside, with its glossier trappings and cushier thrones. He and his wife were diplomatic royalty, jetting around the world. He could bear the ache of a tongue full of tooth marks. Better to be a wretched part of history than no part at all.

The tale sounds familiar because it is. It’s the story of Faust, who sold his soul for renown, then endured the ugliness of that deal. It’s also the story of too many of Trump’s Republican enablers to count. Sure, they decided to prop and pretty him up, a man whose unfitness for the Oval Office was never really in doubt, out of tribal loyalty, a force far too potent in American politics today. But some rushed to him because that’s where the riches were, at least metaphorically. That’s where the fame was."

As president-elect, Mr. Trump affronted Beijing by holding a telephone call with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, the island-democracy that China claims as its own territory. After he took office, the Chinese government worked energetically to smooth relations. When Mr. Trump visited Beijing in 2017, Mr. Xi courted him in the imperial Forbidden City.

Since then their relations have soured. From last year, the two governments have been locked in disagreement over the Trump administration’s demands that China buy more American goods and pull down protective barriers that foreign businesses say put them at a heavy disadvantage in China. The two sides have been trying to contain the trade tensions, but Mr. Trump has also said that he is in no rush to reach an agreement.

Ties with the United States have also been strained over human rights disputes, including China’s mass detentions of Muslim minorities; accusations of Chinese intelligence operations in the United States; American restrictions on visas for Chinese academics and other visitors, and limits on Chinese companies, especially Huawei; and Chinese anger over the United States’ criticisms of policy in Hong Kong, the semiautonomous city where protesters have raged for months against the city’s Beijing-backed leadership.

China’s calculus in dealing with Mr. Trump has become even more fraught after he demanded that Mr. Xi’s government investigate Mr. Biden, an aspiring Democratic challenger to Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Trump already faces a congressional inquiry over his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Mr. Trump told reporters. Moments earlier he had commented on the upcoming trade talks with China, and said, “If they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous power.”"

Volker, a former career foreign service officer, pleaded in 2016 with Eliot A. Cohen and Eric Edelman, two former Republican officials leading a “Never Trump” letter-writing movement.

Their arguments were not wrong, Mr. Volker told them, as both sides remember it. But he argued that Donald J. Trump might actually win the election. And Mr. Volker, who had seen his foreign service career cut short after a new President Barack Obama swiftly removed him as the United States ambassador to NATO, was not going to blacklist himself from a senior post in another administration.

He got a lot more than he wanted.

Mr. Volker, who was President Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine until his abrupt resignation late last month, is today a central player in a political uproar that is threatening Mr. Trump’s presidency with impeachment and contaminating America’s relationship with Ukraine. It has also saddled Mr. Volker with legal bills and may force his resignation from another post, that of executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University, based in Washington. (A final decision had been postponed.)

One bright spot for Mr. Volker, 54, a serious-looking policymaker with wire-rim glasses and a thick crop of salt-and-pepper hair, is that he was to be married Saturday afternoon at Washington National Cathedral to Ia Meurmishvili, a journalist and television anchor for Voice of America’s Georgian service.

But a source in Mr. Pence’s office said that no such trip had been planned.

And when Hurricane Dorian led Mr. Trump to cancel an early-September trip to Warsaw on which he was set to meet with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Pence traveled in place of the president. While there, on Sept. 2, Mr. Pence denied to reporters that he had discussed the elder Mr. Biden with the Ukrainian leader.

“The president asked me to meet with President Zelensky and to talk about the progress that he’s making on a broad range of areas,” Mr. Pence said. “And we did that.”

Mr. Pence did not directly respond to a question at the time about whether the Trump administration had held up $391 million in military aid for the country this summer in order to further pressure Mr. Zelensky’s government. Instead he cited Mr. Trump’s complaint that Europe has not done more to assist Ukraine, adding that “as President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.”

By that time, Mr. Trump’s public remarks had already conflated well-established concerns about endemic corruption in Ukrainian society with his more personalized notion of corruption in the country — namely the alleged activities of the Bidens and unfounded theories that it was Ukraine’s government that meddled in the 2016 election, not Russia’s.

Mr. Pence’s critics say that despite the vice president’s professions of ignorance about the core of Mr. Trump’s political agenda in Ukraine, he knew enough about the president’s mixing of foreign policy and politics to be implicated in any wrongdoing.

At the same time, Mr. Pence appears to have been almost willfully oblivious to Mr. Trump’s public obsession with Ukraine, the Bidens and conspiracy theories surrounding the 2016 election that have also been amplified in public by Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani."

A health scare for Sanders

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had a heart attack this week, and doctors inserted two stents to open a blocked artery.

Mr. Sanders, 78, was taken to a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after he experienced “some chest discomfort” at an event Tuesday night. His wife, Jane Sanders, later said that he was resting comfortably and that he would participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15. The news that he’d had a heart attack was not revealed until he was discharged from the hospital on Friday.

And so inquiries with respect to that are completely important.”

He added: “There’s been some suggestion somehow that it would be inappropriate for the United States government to engage in that activity, and I see it just precisely the opposite. I see our duty to engage in activity that ensures that we have fair, free elections.”

A White House reconstruction of the July 25 call, which Mr. Pompeo listened to as the conversation unfolded, showed that Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to “do us a favor” and investigate whether people in Ukraine were involved in the stealing of emails from the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, is pushing an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians framed the Russian government by making it look like a Ukrainian hack of the Democratic committee was the work of Moscow.

They have tried to signal to Mr. Trump and his allies that the issues will be investigated, even as they tried to telegraph to Democrats that they were not bending to Mr. Trump’s pressure.

At the same time, the prosecutor’s announcement signaled some attention to an issue Mr. Trump raised in the phone call in July and had repeated publicly: a Ukrainian government investigation of a case touching on a likely opponent in next year’s election.

Mr. Trump’s July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is central to the formal House committee impeachment inquiry called by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The inquiry is examining whether Mr. Trump betrayed his oath of office and the nation’s security by seeking to enlist the aid of a foreign power to tarnish a political rival.

On the call, Mr. Zelensky suggested that he would assist with an investigation of Burisma, according to White House notes of the call. The Ukrainian president said that a new prosecutor general would soon be appointed who would be “100 percent my person” and would “look into the situation.”

The Ukrainian president said his country was also almost ready to purchase anti-tank missiles, made by Raytheon, to be used to better repel armored assaults by Russian-supported fighters. Mr. Trump responded, “I’d like you to do us a favor, though.”

Mr. Trump has vigorously denied doing anything wrong, and allies of the president said that a reconstructed transcript of the call showed no quid pro quo, making the impeachment inquiry baseless. But Democrats said that Mr. Trump’s request for a favor, and the fact that he had already withheld millions in aid from Ukraine before the call, raised serious questions that must be examined.

On Thursday, the State Department gave initial approval to the $39.2 million sale of 150 Javelin missiles and related equipment to Ukraine. The sale of the javelins to Ukraine must still go through Congress. Ukraine has been fighting Russia for five years in eastern Ukraine since Moscow’s seizure of Crimea."

The two biggest disasters in Trump’s presidency have both been cases where these guardrails collapsed, and the president actually got his way in full. He actually fired James Comey, setting in motion the probe whose workings dominated his first term, and his Homeland Security apparatus actually separated thousands of migrant children from their families, creating the biggest moral scandal of his presidency.

But in other cases he has been protected by the “don’t-give-him-the-alligator” operations all around him. Indeed, the ultimate fizzle of the Mueller report was possible because that report ended up documenting a president whose staff let him rant about obstructing justice, but then — in Mueller’s own words — mostly “declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”

With the Ukraine scandal, though, this protection has broken down again. (Not least because in Rudy Giuliani, Trump found an adviser even more enthusiastic about alligators than his boss.) The quest to get Ukraine’s government to reopen an investigation that would touch the Biden family wasn’t just a wish that Trump expressed; it was a policy objective that, however reluctantly and haphazardly, the U.S. government seems to have pursued. Trump’s now-publicized conversation with the Ukrainian president was itself an act of foreign policy, not just a spitballing conversation, and, whatever its intentions, so was the delay of military aid. We can’t see the full body of the alligator, but you can see it moving in the water; it’s right there.

Now clearly people around Trump still believed that they weren’t going all the way to Alligatortown with Rudy, and maybe when we see the full shape of things it will be clear that the president’s men did actually prevent the most explicitly Biden-focused quid pro quo from taking shape. In which case there will be defenses of Trump that say, in effect: Look, he wanted an alligator, and we let one thrash around in the water for a while, but we always kept it on a leash.

I expect that will be the defense offered, eventually, by pained Republican senators voting to acquit — that this was bad behavior but happily the president’s diplomats kept things from reaching the level of an impeachable offense.

The only difficulty will be that Trumpland will probably spend the next few months making a different argument: Actually, alligators are great.

Recalling the difficulty Hillary Clinton had in confronting Mr. Trump’s campaign style, Mr. Biden worried about being “sucked into the trap of the stuff that Trump was laying. He wants you in a mud fight.”

“But when you respond to that,” he continued, “it brings you back down into that.”

Mr. Biden was even blunter, and angrier, in private after news first emerged that Mr. Trump had exhorted the Ukrainian government to investigate him and his son.

“I can’t believe this guy is going after my family like this,” he told Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, as the two campaigned in Iowa, Mr. Coons recalled.

Leading Democrats have been pleading privately with Mr. Biden and his top aides to aggressively confront Mr. Trump, and expressing impatience with them for not seizing this opportunity to engage him in a two-man race. After all, Mr. Biden had spent months framing his candidacy as a singular crusade to oust an aberrant president.

“It’s time to really respond so everybody hears it,” said Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a campaign co-chairman. “If someone says something enough, people will start to believe it, and this president gets in his zone of telling a lie over and over again. You have to make sure people don’t believe in it.”"

Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. “We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” she said, adding “We are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a “finance committee forum,” questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden’s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised.

On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden’s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny “Joe 2020” pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden’s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private.

Multiple attendees said Ms. Warren was, by far, Mr. Biden’s most discussed opponent, with his strategists telling donors they expected her to come under new press scrutiny now that she has risen in the polls."

This was more than a year into Trump’s presidency, by which point the rationalizations of other supposedly serious conservatives who took top administration jobs no longer held water. It was clear that Trump wasn’t just a few artful nudges away from proper presidential bearing. He couldn’t be lifted up because he was too busy cruelly dragging everyone else down.

But Pompeo had a heady shot at a vaunted job that almost surely wasn’t going to come his way any other time. So he lunged for it, then demonstrated with his obsequiousness that doing good and doing right were never high on the agenda.

He wrote an op-ed article that essentially broke with his fellow Republicans to promote Trump’s view that Saudi Arabia’s butchery of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi shouldn’t give anyone pause. What are a few severed body parts among allies?

He recalled the ambassador to Ukraine just to please the president and his babbling Beelzebub, Rudy Giuliani. He listened mutely to that July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, decided to ignore what he heard and then claimed — until a few days ago — that he was utterly in the dark about any pressure on Ukraine to kneecap Joe Biden.

In Greece on Saturday, he proudly portrayed the Trump administration’s approach to Ukraine as a high-minded vigil against corruption and an attempt to ensure against interference in American elections. In the process he gave fresh currency to a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential race.

Had he spoken up about the phone call or pushed back, he would have risked ending up on the outside, among the swelling Trump administration diaspora. He preferred the inside, with its glossier trappings and cushier thrones. He and his wife were diplomatic royalty, jetting around the world. He could bear the ache of a tongue full of tooth marks. Better to be a wretched part of history than no part at all.

The tale sounds familiar because it is. It’s the story of Faust, who sold his soul for renown, then endured the ugliness of that deal. It’s also the story of too many of Trump’s Republican enablers to count. Sure, they decided to prop and pretty him up, a man whose unfitness for the Oval Office was never really in doubt, out of tribal loyalty, a force far too potent in American politics today. But some rushed to him because that’s where the riches were, at least metaphorically. That’s where the fame was."

As president-elect, Mr. Trump affronted Beijing by holding a telephone call with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, the island-democracy that China claims as its own territory. After he took office, the Chinese government worked energetically to smooth relations. When Mr. Trump visited Beijing in 2017, Mr. Xi courted him in the imperial Forbidden City.

Since then their relations have soured. From last year, the two governments have been locked in disagreement over the Trump administration’s demands that China buy more American goods and pull down protective barriers that foreign businesses say put them at a heavy disadvantage in China. The two sides have been trying to contain the trade tensions, but Mr. Trump has also said that he is in no rush to reach an agreement.

Ties with the United States have also been strained over human rights disputes, including China’s mass detentions of Muslim minorities; accusations of Chinese intelligence operations in the United States; American restrictions on visas for Chinese academics and other visitors, and limits on Chinese companies, especially Huawei; and Chinese anger over the United States’ criticisms of policy in Hong Kong, the semiautonomous city where protesters have raged for months against the city’s Beijing-backed leadership.

China’s calculus in dealing with Mr. Trump has become even more fraught after he demanded that Mr. Xi’s government investigate Mr. Biden, an aspiring Democratic challenger to Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Trump already faces a congressional inquiry over his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Mr. Trump told reporters. Moments earlier he had commented on the upcoming trade talks with China, and said, “If they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous power.”"

Their arguments were not wrong, Mr. Volker told them, as both sides remember it. But he argued that Donald J. Trump might actually win the election. And Mr. Volker, who had seen his foreign service career cut short after a new President Barack Obama swiftly removed him as the United States ambassador to NATO, was not going to blacklist himself from a senior post in another administration.

He got a lot more than he wanted.

Mr. Volker, who was President Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine until his abrupt resignation late last month, is today a central player in a political uproar that is threatening Mr. Trump’s presidency with impeachment and contaminating America’s relationship with Ukraine. It has also saddled Mr. Volker with legal bills and may force his resignation from another post, that of executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University, based in Washington. (A final decision had been postponed.)

One bright spot for Mr. Volker, 54, a serious-looking policymaker with wire-rim glasses and a thick crop of salt-and-pepper hair, is that he was to be married Saturday afternoon at Washington National Cathedral to Ia Meurmishvili, a journalist and television anchor for Voice of America’s Georgian service.

And so inquiries with respect to that are completely important.”

He added: “There’s been some suggestion somehow that it would be inappropriate for the United States government to engage in that activity, and I see it just precisely the opposite. I see our duty to engage in activity that ensures that we have fair, free elections.”

A White House reconstruction of the July 25 call, which Mr. Pompeo listened to as the conversation unfolded, showed that Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to “do us a favor” and investigate whether people in Ukraine were involved in the stealing of emails from the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, is pushing an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians framed the Russian government by making it look like a Ukrainian hack of the Democratic committee was the work of Moscow.

President George Bush was losing his re-election race, and they told him the only way to win was to hammer his challenger Bill Clinton’s patriotism for protesting the Vietnam War while in London and visiting Moscow as a young man.

Mr. Bush was largely on board with that approach. But what came next crossed the line, as far as he and his team were concerned. “They wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton’s trip to Moscow,” James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush’s White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo later that day. “I said we absolutely could not do that.”

President Trump insists he and his attorney general did nothing wrong by seeking damaging information about his domestic opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and Britain or by publicly calling on China to investigate his most prominent Democratic challenger.

To the Editor:

It appears that some of President Trump’s most ardent supporters (for example, Tucker Carlson) are now suggesting that Republicans stop their fruitless efforts to label Mr. Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president as appropriate but instead urge that such conduct does not merit impeachment and that his fate should be determined by the 2020 election. And, of course, Democrats agonized for months over impeachment versus a fair and free election by the people in 2020.

How can we wait for and rely upon an election when it is now absolutely established that Mr. Trump has done, is doing and without question will continue to do everything he can to make sure the 2020 election is neither fair nor free? There is no choice but to impeach.

To the Editor:

In your coverage of the “do us a favor” conversation between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, there’s one word that is consistently overlooked: “though.” In the president’s statement “I would like you to do us a favor though,” “though” is qualifying (in a grammatical sense) the previous sentence, in which President Volodymyr Zelensky states his desire for more American military aid."

Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. “We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” she said, adding “We are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a “finance committee forum,” questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden’s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised.

On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden’s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny “Joe 2020” pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden’s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private.

Multiple attendees said Ms. Warren was, by far, Mr. Biden’s most discussed opponent, with his strategists telling donors they expected her to come under new press scrutiny now that she has risen in the polls."

Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February.

Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders’s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.

​“This will just raise the issue of his age​, which to me has always been the Achilles’ heel of the Sanders campaign,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. “When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.”

Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.

Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public colleges.

President George Bush was losing his re-election race, and they told him the only way to win was to hammer his challenger Bill Clinton’s patriotism for protesting the Vietnam War while in London and visiting Moscow as a young man.

Mr. Bush was largely on board with that approach. But what came next crossed the line, as far as he and his team were concerned. “They wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton’s trip to Moscow,” James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush’s White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo later that day. “I said we absolutely could not do that.”

President Trump insists he and his attorney general did nothing wrong by seeking damaging information about his domestic opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and Britain or by publicly calling on China to investigate his most prominent Democratic challenger. But for every other White House in the modern era, Republican and Democratic, the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage was seen as unwise and politically dangerous, if not unprincipled.

The question ever since has been whether Volodymyr Zelensky, the comedian who played Mr. Holoborodko and now leads Ukraine, is indeed the idealistic, modest and scrupulously honest corruption-buster whose guiding thought as president is: “One should act in a way that doesn’t evoke shame when looking into children’s eyes. Or their parents’. Or yours.”

The infamous reconstructed transcript of Mr. Zelensky’s telephone conversation with President Trump does evoke embarrassment. The Ukrainian enthusiastically demeans himself before Mr. Trump, calling him a “great teacher,” joining him in trashing European leaders, bad-mouthing the American ambassador Mr. Trump fired for all the wrong reasons and pledging to work on the investigations that Mr. Trump was seeking for his own political ends. He also notes that he stayed in one of Mr. Trump’s hotels the last time he was in the United States.

But whether that performance was Mr. Zelensky revealing his real self or his Holoborodko character colliding with rude reality is a tough call. Ukraine, as Mr. Zelensky has noted, is fighting two wars — one against entrenched corruption fueled by a coterie of oligarchs, the other against rebel secessionists in eastern Ukraine propped up by Russia."

To the Editor:

It appears that some of President Trump’s most ardent supporters (for example, Tucker Carlson) are now suggesting that Republicans stop their fruitless efforts to label Mr. Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president as appropriate but instead urge that such conduct does not merit impeachment and that his fate should be determined by the 2020 election. And, of course, Democrats agonized for months over impeachment versus a fair and free election by the people in 2020.

How can we wait for and rely upon an election when it is now absolutely established that Mr. Trump has done, is doing and without question will continue to do everything he can to make sure the 2020 election is neither fair nor free? There is no choice but to impeach.

To the Editor:

In your coverage of the “do us a favor” conversation between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, there’s one word that is consistently overlooked: “though.” In the president’s statement “I would like you to do us a favor though,” “though” is qualifying (in a grammatical sense) the previous sentence, in which President Volodymyr Zelensky states his desire for more American military aid."

This is a political process. And they’re leaning heavily into that idea with the eight-page letter the White House counsel sent tonight. We also see that in the polls: How people view Trump’s actions and the actions of House Democrats is split by party.

We also already know how this story almost certainly ends : Mr. Trump is not going to be convicted by the Senate. Does it matter for him whether there are one or two charges? His, and the White House’s, calculation is: no.

But isn’t that kind of resistance just going to harden Democrats’ belief that there’s some kind of cover-up?

Some witnesses could be really bad for the president, so the White House wants to have a broad position that they’re not going to play along. There were differing opinions internally about the case of Sondland, who some people thought would have had a story to tell that would have been helpful to Trump. But they ultimately decided — really late at night — that their position was about something broader.

Remember when they decided to release the transcript of Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president? In that case, they clearly made the opposite calculation: Looking like we’re hiding something is worse than the facts in the transcript, which were pretty bad. Now, they’ve basically decided that looking like they’re hiding something is better than looking like they’re cooperating with what they’re calling an illegitimate investigation. House Democrats have only had one witness so far, Kurt Volker, and look how much House Democrats got! They have in writing that there could have been a quid pro quo. What else could they find with even just one more?"

“Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!” wrote Mr. Trump.

There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China, the other country Mr. Trump was alluding to in his tweet. The president has also urged China to look into the Bidens.

Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. He noted that his 2016 call to fire Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was part of United States government policy under President Barack Obama. It also reflected the wishes of a group of Republican senators at the time, who sought Mr. Shokin’s ouster because he was seen as unwilling to target corruption, Mr. Biden said.

A longtime senator before he became vice president, Mr. Biden is deferential to congressional prerogatives and has resisted calling for impeachment, even as Ms. Warren and many of his other Democratic rivals have been outspoken in demanding it.

Last month, when House Democrats began moving toward an impeachment inquiry, he said they should only do so if Mr. Trump did not cooperate with their investigation. Then last week he said he would let Congress “do its job on impeachment.” And at a later event on Wednesday, in Manchester, N.H., he nodded to his longstanding discomfort with impeachment, calling it “a God-awful thing for a nation to go through.”

But as Mr. Trump and his allies wage near-daily political warfare against Mr. Biden, he has sought to mount a counteroffensive.

He began his rebuttal in a speech last week in Reno, Nev., but on Wednesday he went even further. Speaking from a teleprompter and dressed formally in suit and tie, he used his first trip back to New Hampshire since the impeachment investigation got underway to both taunt and condemn Mr. Trump in remarkably stark language."

After his election in 1972, Mr. Biden had spoken to Mr. Nixon in an uncomfortable, minute-long courtesy phone call from the president after Mr. Biden’s wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash that December. (“I understand you were on the Hill at the time, and your wife was just driving by herself,” Mr. Nixon said, stammering for a few beats, according to a recording. “The main part is, you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory.”)

In his floor speech on impeachment, labeled in the Congressional Record under “Fairness to the President,” Mr. Biden described himself as a harsh critic of Mr. Nixon, but he added that the president was due the “utmost presumption of innocence.”

“In a day when equality is on everyone’s lips, I suggest that in practice, in extraordinary times involving our highest office of government, some people may be, in fact, more equal than others,” Mr. Biden said. “And in this case, I refer to the president. His official derelictions, if proved, and his subsequent ouster, should it occur, will have an impact on our institutions and upon ourselves as Americans, beyond that which it would have for any of us who are involved in such a proceeding.”

Moving through the Capitol, Mr. Biden seemed awed at the historical burden that greeted him. “We were walking down the hall and he said, ‘What a time for me to come into the Senate,’” recalled Rufus Edmisten, then the deputy chief counsel to the Senate Watergate committee. “‘I would come at a time like this.’”

In his 2007 memoir, “Promises to Keep,” Mr. Biden described a formative memory of a crucial meeting after Mr. Nixon asked Senator John Stennis, a conservative Democrat from Mississippi, to run interference for the White House by listening to the Watergate tapes and summarizing them for his colleagues, rather than insisting on their wide release.

“I remember what he said in the Democratic caucus that day: ‘I’ve thought long and hard on what my obligation is,’” Mr. Biden wrote, quoting Mr. Stennis, “‘and I’ve decided I am a Senate man. I am not the president’s man. Therefore, I will not listen to the tapes. I am a man of the Senate.’ I’m proud to say I am a Senate man, too.”

Mr. Kaufman said that it was not until August, days before Mr. Nixon’s resignation, that Mr. Biden became convinced that the president must go."

Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February.

Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders’s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.

​“This will just raise the issue of his age​, which to me has always been the Achilles’ heel of the Sanders campaign,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. “When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.”

Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.

Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public colleges.

Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday."

The question ever since has been whether Volodymyr Zelensky, the comedian who played Mr. Holoborodko and now leads Ukraine, is indeed the idealistic, modest and scrupulously honest corruption-buster whose guiding thought as president is: “One should act in a way that doesn’t evoke shame when looking into children’s eyes. Or their parents’. Or yours.”

The infamous reconstructed transcript of Mr. Zelensky’s telephone conversation with President Trump does evoke embarrassment. The Ukrainian enthusiastically demeans himself before Mr. Trump, calling him a “great teacher,” joining him in trashing European leaders, bad-mouthing the American ambassador Mr. Trump fired for all the wrong reasons and pledging to work on the investigations that Mr. Trump was seeking for his own political ends. He also notes that he stayed in one of Mr. Trump’s hotels the last time he was in the United States.

But whether that performance was Mr. Zelensky revealing his real self or his Holoborodko character colliding with rude reality is a tough call. Ukraine, as Mr. Zelensky has noted, is fighting two wars — one against entrenched corruption fueled by a coterie of oligarchs, the other against rebel secessionists in eastern Ukraine propped up by Russia."

This morning’s episode of “The Daily” followed Representative Elissa Slotkin, a moderate Democrat, as she went to three forums in her mid-Michigan district — including one at the East Lansing pie bakery where I worked the 5 a.m. shift in high school!

There truly is strength in numbers. Just a few Republicans — notably Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, both avowed members of the party’s noninterventionist wing — hailed the president’s decision.

“Foreign policy has always been Trump’s Achilles’ heel with Senate Republicans,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former staff adviser to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican who faulted the president’s Syria decision — but not his comments about China and Ukraine. Mr. Conant said Republicans were also driven by their view that Mr. Trump’s foreign policy missteps were more damaging, requiring a more forceful response than his day-to-day incendiary statements.

“Everyone forgets Trump’s tweets after a couple of days,” Mr. Conant said. “But history will never forget if the U.S. allows our Kurdish allies to be massacred.”

At the same time, foreign policy — unlike, say, impeachment — is lower on the president’s priority list. Differences of opinion are less likely to spur him to lash out as he has in recent days, for example, at Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, after Mr. Romney said that the president’s requests of Ukraine and China to investigate Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were “wrong and appalling.” Mr. Trump responded with name-calling, disparagement and a gleeful reminder of Mr. Obama’s defeat of Mr. Romney in 2012.

Foreign policy appears to be one of the few areas where Mr. Trump is willing to brook some difference of opinion. Pressed on Monday about the tough criticism of his Syria policy from the likes of Mr. Graham; Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Nikki R. Haley, Mr. Trump’s former United Nations ambassador, the president was uncharacteristically restrained.

“I have great respect for all of the people that you named,” Mr. Trump said. “And they have their opinion, and a lot of people do. And I could also name many more than you just named of people that totally are supportive. You see the names coming out; people are extremely thrilled because they say it’s time to bring our people back home.”"

Mr. Biden’s supporters seem incredulous that his record and proposals have not won young voters over.

“This is a guy who was introducing bills on climate change before this was on the radar screen of most politicians,” said Jake Sullivan, who served as Mr. Biden’s national security adviser in the White House. “He’s somebody who talks about the issue in an incredibly passionate and purposeful way.”

Mr. Biden’s campaign challenged the belief among many younger activists that the former vice president is not likely to make climate change a top priority if elected.

“There are some folks in the climate movement who are very vocal,” said Stef Feldman, Mr. Biden’s policy director. “There are also folks who are believers in the drastic efforts that we need to do to combat climate change who think Joe Biden is the best one equipped to address the challenge, because he has the experience of bringing other countries to the table.”

But other issues keep drowning out that message. Questions about Mr. Biden’s ability to energize voters on climate change come as national political attention is focused on accusations that President Trump put pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who once sat on the board of a Ukrainian company, Burisma.

President Trump’s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell , are being accused of having profited from their commercial ties to Beijing. In 2004, the two had a net worth of about $3.1 million, according to public disclosures. Three years later, the range was $3.1 million to $12.7 million. The next year, their net worth rocketed to $7.3 million to $33.1 million.

What changed? In 2008, Ms. Chao’s father, James Chao, gave the couple a “gift” of $5 million to $25 million ( politicians are required to report money in ranges, not exact amounts ). Certainly, their wealth has continued to grow.

Mr. Chao’s generosity was made possible by the fortune he has amassed through his shipping company, Foremost Group, which has thrived in large part because of its close ties with the Chinese government. In late 1993, Mr. Chao and his son-in-law, Mr. McConnell, traveled to China as guests of the state-owned shipyard conglomerate and military contractor, China State Shipbuilding Corporation . There they met with an old classmate of Mr. Chao’s, the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin.

Mr. McConnell’s once hard-line condemnations of China softened in the years to follow. For example, as The New Republic has noted, Mr. McConnell went from telling University of Louisville students that America would never forget Tiananmen Square, in the late 1980s, to hosting the Chinese ambassador at the same school several years later, even as the ambassador publicly defended the regime’s suppression of the Falun Gong.

All along, the Chaos continued to gain influence. Mr. McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, and James Chao sat on the board of the holding company for China State Shipbuilding. While Elaine Chao was secretary of labor under George W. Bush, Foremost Group ordered several enormous cargo ships from a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding. Secretary Chao and her father also appeared in several tandem interviews with Chinese media, and in at least one, they sit in front of the Department of Transportation’s emblem and alongside images of a book written by Mr. Chao. Today, Angela Chao sits on the board of the Chinese government’s Bank of China.

Last month, the House Oversight and Reform Committee started an investigation into whether Secretary Chao has leveraged her government positions to benefit her family. But so far there is no investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Defenders claim there must first be proof that a law was broken to open an investigation. That’s exactly backward. Congress can and should conduct an inquiry to determine whether anything illegal occurred.

The problem more broadly is that we rely on a hodgepodge of laws that lack the clarity and bright ethical lines found in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That needs to change. International bribery laws clearly state that if a person or entity pays a politician’s family member and gets favors in return, it’s an act of bribery; it’s no different from the politician taking the money himself ."

This is a political process. And they’re leaning heavily into that idea with the eight-page letter the White House counsel sent tonight. We also see that in the polls: How people view Trump’s actions and the actions of House Democrats is split by party.

We also already know how this story almost certainly ends : Mr. Trump is not going to be convicted by the Senate. Does it matter for him whether there are one or two charges? His, and the White House’s, calculation is: no.

But isn’t that kind of resistance just going to harden Democrats’ belief that there’s some kind of cover-up?

Some witnesses could be really bad for the president, so the White House wants to have a broad position that they’re not going to play along. There were differing opinions internally about the case of Sondland, who some people thought would have had a story to tell that would have been helpful to Trump. But they ultimately decided — really late at night — that their position was about something broader.

Remember when they decided to release the transcript of Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president? In that case, they clearly made the opposite calculation: Looking like we’re hiding something is worse than the facts in the transcript, which were pretty bad. Now, they’ve basically decided that looking like they’re hiding something is better than looking like they’re cooperating with what they’re calling an illegitimate investigation. House Democrats have only had one witness so far, Kurt Volker, and look how much House Democrats got! They have in writing that there could have been a quid pro quo. What else could they find with even just one more?"

“Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!” wrote Mr. Trump.

There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China, the other country Mr. Trump was alluding to in his tweet. The president has also urged China to look into the Bidens.

Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. He noted that his 2016 call to fire Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was part of United States government policy under President Barack Obama. It also reflected the wishes of a group of Republican senators at the time, who sought Mr. Shokin’s ouster because he was seen as unwilling to target corruption, Mr. Biden said.

A longtime senator before he became vice president, Mr. Biden is deferential to congressional prerogatives and has resisted calling for impeachment, even as Ms. Warren and many of his other Democratic rivals have been outspoken in demanding it.

Last month, when House Democrats began moving toward an impeachment inquiry, he said they should only do so if Mr. Trump did not cooperate with their investigation. Then last week he said he would let Congress “do its job on impeachment.” And at a later event on Wednesday, in Manchester, N.H., he nodded to his longstanding discomfort with impeachment, calling it “a God-awful thing for a nation to go through.”

But as Mr. Trump and his allies wage near-daily political warfare against Mr. Biden, he has sought to mount a counteroffensive.

He began his rebuttal in a speech last week in Reno, Nev., but on Wednesday he went even further. Speaking from a teleprompter and dressed formally in suit and tie, he used his first trip back to New Hampshire since the impeachment investigation got underway to both taunt and condemn Mr. Trump in remarkably stark language."

After his election in 1972, Mr. Biden had spoken to Mr. Nixon in an uncomfortable, minute-long courtesy phone call from the president after Mr. Biden’s wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash that December. (“I understand you were on the Hill at the time, and your wife was just driving by herself,” Mr. Nixon said, stammering for a few beats, according to a recording. “The main part is, you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory.”)

In his floor speech on impeachment, labeled in the Congressional Record under “Fairness to the President,” Mr. Biden described himself as a harsh critic of Mr. Nixon, but he added that the president was due the “utmost presumption of innocence.”

“In a day when equality is on everyone’s lips, I suggest that in practice, in extraordinary times involving our highest office of government, some people may be, in fact, more equal than others,” Mr. Biden said. “And in this case, I refer to the president. His official derelictions, if proved, and his subsequent ouster, should it occur, will have an impact on our institutions and upon ourselves as Americans, beyond that which it would have for any of us who are involved in such a proceeding.”

Moving through the Capitol, Mr. Biden seemed awed at the historical burden that greeted him. “We were walking down the hall and he said, ‘What a time for me to come into the Senate,’” recalled Rufus Edmisten, then the deputy chief counsel to the Senate Watergate committee. “‘I would come at a time like this.’”

In his 2007 memoir, “Promises to Keep,” Mr. Biden described a formative memory of a crucial meeting after Mr. Nixon asked Senator John Stennis, a conservative Democrat from Mississippi, to run interference for the White House by listening to the Watergate tapes and summarizing them for his colleagues, rather than insisting on their wide release.

“I remember what he said in the Democratic caucus that day: ‘I’ve thought long and hard on what my obligation is,’” Mr. Biden wrote, quoting Mr. Stennis, “‘and I’ve decided I am a Senate man. I am not the president’s man. Therefore, I will not listen to the tapes. I am a man of the Senate.’ I’m proud to say I am a Senate man, too.”

Mr. Kaufman said that it was not until August, days before Mr. Nixon’s resignation, that Mr. Biden became convinced that the president must go."

Three Democratic chairmen leading the inquiry instructed Mr. Perry to turn over by next Friday any records that would shed light on President Trump’s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government to open corruption investigations into former Vice President Joseph R.

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , two associates of Rudy Giuliani , were indicted on campaign finance charges. They were part of the pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate President Trump ’s political rivals, including Joe Biden .

Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York said Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman “conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office,” including by making donations to a pro-Trump super PAC. Read the indictment.

The indictment refers to a “Congressman-1” — identified in campaign finance filings as former Representative Pete Sessions , Republican of Texas — who was the beneficiary of approximately $3 million that the super PAC spent during the 2018 cycle. The men sought Mr. Sessions’s assistance in removing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, “at least in part at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,” according to the indictment. (The men were also seeking political assistance setting up a legal marijuana business in Nevada.)

Shortly after the indictment became public, House impeachment investigators issued subpoenas to Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, compelling them to speak with Congress about their work with Mr. Giuliani in Ukraine.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry was subpoenaed for records that could shed light on any role he may have played in Mr. Trump’s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government. Investigators also want to know whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine’s state-owned gas company.

A dramatic airport arrest

Katie Benner, who covers the Justice Department for us, said federal prosecutors probably had the indictment ready to go for a while and were keeping tabs on Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. When the two got one-way tickets out of the country, she said, the prosecutors realized that they had to move.

My colleague Mike Schmidt got an eyewitness account of the arrests in the Lufthansa lounge in the B concourse of Dulles International Airport on Wednesday. Here’s what he heard:

They were indulging themselves in the free drinks and food while talking on the phone and waiting for their overnight flight to Frankfurt. Around 5:45 p.m., the men and the other first class travelers were invited to board before all the other passengers. As they made their way down a corridor toward their plane, two plainclothes officers stepped out and stopped them. “We need to see your passports,” one of the officers said. The passengers took them out, and the officers determined who was standing in front of them. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were told to turn around. As they made their way back into the terminal, they were greeted by a phalanx of uniformed and plainclothes officers who arrested them.

What were Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman up to?

At first glance, the two men might seem peripheral to the events that the House is investigating. But they were involved in the Ukraine affair from the beginning, dating to Mr. Parnas’s job as Mr. Giuliani’s fixer in Ukraine.

This evening I stopped by the desk of my colleague Ken Vogel, who revealed Mr. Parnas’s involvement in Mr. Giuliani’s Ukraine efforts, to get a sense of why they matter to the impeachment investigation."

There truly is strength in numbers. Just a few Republicans — notably Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, both avowed members of the party’s noninterventionist wing — hailed the president’s decision.

“Foreign policy has always been Trump’s Achilles’ heel with Senate Republicans,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former staff adviser to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican who faulted the president’s Syria decision — but not his comments about China and Ukraine. Mr. Conant said Republicans were also driven by their view that Mr. Trump’s foreign policy missteps were more damaging, requiring a more forceful response than his day-to-day incendiary statements.

“Everyone forgets Trump’s tweets after a couple of days,” Mr. Conant said. “But history will never forget if the U.S. allows our Kurdish allies to be massacred.”

At the same time, foreign policy — unlike, say, impeachment — is lower on the president’s priority list. Differences of opinion are less likely to spur him to lash out as he has in recent days, for example, at Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, after Mr. Romney said that the president’s requests of Ukraine and China to investigate Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were “wrong and appalling.” Mr. Trump responded with name-calling, disparagement and a gleeful reminder of Mr. Obama’s defeat of Mr. Romney in 2012.

Foreign policy appears to be one of the few areas where Mr. Trump is willing to brook some difference of opinion. Pressed on Monday about the tough criticism of his Syria policy from the likes of Mr. Graham; Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Nikki R. Haley, Mr. Trump’s former United Nations ambassador, the president was uncharacteristically restrained.

“I have great respect for all of the people that you named,” Mr. Trump said. “And they have their opinion, and a lot of people do. And I could also name many more than you just named of people that totally are supportive. You see the names coming out; people are extremely thrilled because they say it’s time to bring our people back home.”"

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , two associates of Rudy Giuliani , were indicted on campaign finance charges. They were part of the pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate President Trump ’s political rivals, including Joe Biden .

Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York said Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman “conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office,” including by making donations to a pro-Trump super PAC. Read the indictment.

The indictment refers to a “Congressman-1” — identified in campaign finance filings as former Representative Pete Sessions , Republican of Texas — who was the beneficiary of approximately $3 million that the super PAC spent during the 2018 cycle. The men sought Mr. Sessions’s assistance in removing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, “at least in part at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,” according to the indictment. (The men were also seeking political assistance setting up a legal marijuana business in Nevada.)

Shortly after the indictment became public, House impeachment investigators issued subpoenas to Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, compelling them to speak with Congress about their work with Mr. Giuliani in Ukraine.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry was subpoenaed for records that could shed light on any role he may have played in Mr. Trump’s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government. Investigators also want to know whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine’s state-owned gas company.

A dramatic airport arrest

Katie Benner, who covers the Justice Department for us, said federal prosecutors probably had the indictment ready to go for a while and were keeping tabs on Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. When the two got one-way tickets out of the country, she said, the prosecutors realized that they had to move.

My colleague Mike Schmidt got an eyewitness account of the arrests in the Lufthansa lounge in the B concourse of Dulles International Airport on Wednesday. Here’s what he heard:

They were indulging themselves in the free drinks and food while talking on the phone and waiting for their overnight flight to Frankfurt. Around 5:45 p.m., the men and the other first class travelers were invited to board before all the other passengers. As they made their way down a corridor toward their plane, two plainclothes officers stepped out and stopped them. “We need to see your passports,” one of the officers said. The passengers took them out, and the officers determined who was standing in front of them. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were told to turn around. As they made their way back into the terminal, they were greeted by a phalanx of uniformed and plainclothes officers who arrested them.

What were Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman up to?

At first glance, the two men might seem peripheral to the events that the House is investigating. But they were involved in the Ukraine affair from the beginning, dating to Mr. Parnas’s job as Mr. Giuliani’s fixer in Ukraine.

This evening I stopped by the desk of my colleague Ken Vogel, who revealed Mr. Parnas’s involvement in Mr. Giuliani’s Ukraine efforts, to get a sense of why they matter to the impeachment investigation."

Young Activists Want More.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/climate/climate-change-biden.html,"On a personal level, the candidate can’t quite connect with an incensed climate movement personified by Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish activist who angrily chastised world leaders gathered at the United Nations last month, saying, “If you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.”

Mr. Biden’s supporters seem incredulous that his record and proposals have not won young voters over.

“This is a guy who was introducing bills on climate change before this was on the radar screen of most politicians,” said Jake Sullivan, who served as Mr. Biden’s national security adviser in the White House. “He’s somebody who talks about the issue in an incredibly passionate and purposeful way.”

Mr. Biden’s campaign challenged the belief among many younger activists that the former vice president is not likely to make climate change a top priority if elected.

“There are some folks in the climate movement who are very vocal,” said Stef Feldman, Mr. Biden’s policy director. “There are also folks who are believers in the drastic efforts that we need to do to combat climate change who think Joe Biden is the best one equipped to address the challenge, because he has the experience of bringing other countries to the table.”

But other issues keep drowning out that message. Questions about Mr. Biden’s ability to energize voters on climate change come as national political attention is focused on accusations that President Trump put pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who once sat on the board of a Ukrainian company, Burisma. (Despite Mr. Trump’s accusations of corruption on the part of the Bidens, no evidence has surfaced that the former vice president knowingly took any steps to help his son or the company.)

Trump supporters might focus on Hunter Biden’s monthly salary, as much as $50,000. Climate activists are more concerned about Burisma’s business: natural gas."

President Trump’s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell , are being accused of having profited from their commercial ties to Beijing. In 2004, the two had a net worth of about $3.1 million, according to public disclosures. Three years later, the range was $3.1 million to $12.7 million. The next year, their net worth rocketed to $7.3 million to $33.1 million.

What changed? In 2008, Ms. Chao’s father, James Chao, gave the couple a “gift” of $5 million to $25 million ( politicians are required to report money in ranges, not exact amounts ). Certainly, their wealth has continued to grow.

Mr. Chao’s generosity was made possible by the fortune he has amassed through his shipping company, Foremost Group, which has thrived in large part because of its close ties with the Chinese government. In late 1993, Mr. Chao and his son-in-law, Mr. McConnell, traveled to China as guests of the state-owned shipyard conglomerate and military contractor, China State Shipbuilding Corporation . There they met with an old classmate of Mr. Chao’s, the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin.

Mr. McConnell’s once hard-line condemnations of China softened in the years to follow. For example, as The New Republic has noted, Mr. McConnell went from telling University of Louisville students that America would never forget Tiananmen Square, in the late 1980s, to hosting the Chinese ambassador at the same school several years later, even as the ambassador publicly defended the regime’s suppression of the Falun Gong.

All along, the Chaos continued to gain influence. Mr. McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, and James Chao sat on the board of the holding company for China State Shipbuilding. While Elaine Chao was secretary of labor under George W. Bush, Foremost Group ordered several enormous cargo ships from a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding. Secretary Chao and her father also appeared in several tandem interviews with Chinese media, and in at least one, they sit in front of the Department of Transportation’s emblem and alongside images of a book written by Mr. Chao. Today, Angela Chao sits on the board of the Chinese government’s Bank of China.

Last month, the House Oversight and Reform Committee started an investigation into whether Secretary Chao has leveraged her government positions to benefit her family. But so far there is no investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Defenders claim there must first be proof that a law was broken to open an investigation. That’s exactly backward. Congress can and should conduct an inquiry to determine whether anything illegal occurred.

The problem more broadly is that we rely on a hodgepodge of laws that lack the clarity and bright ethical lines found in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That needs to change. International bribery laws clearly state that if a person or entity pays a politician’s family member and gets favors in return, it’s an act of bribery; it’s no different from the politician taking the money himself ."

The current controversy stems from two separate but related events. The first revolves around leaked audio of Mark Zuckerberg speaking privately to employees at recent town hall meetings, where he called Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plans to break up Facebook an “existential” threat to the company and one he would fight. The second is a recent announcement by Facebook that it is exempting political figures from its policy forbidding spreading misinformation in advertisements (yes, politicians spreading false claims in their ads is just a part of the political conversation, according to Facebook).

Both developments have attracted the ire of Warren who, in a series of tweets this week, argued that the public has a right to know how Facebook “intends to use their influence in this election” and implied that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook might be intentionally emboldening the Trump campaign by relaxing advertising rules. Fellow Democrats echoed the concerns: Seema Nanda, C.E.O. of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that the social network’s ad policy “is a serious missed opportunity by Facebook.” At the same time, old fears that the company’s “I Voted” button, which has proved effective at boosting get-out-the-vote efforts, could give an outsize advantage to Mr. Trump are recirculating.

But Ms. Warren’s concerns miss a key point about the social network’s roles in elections.

Yes, Facebook’s willingness to let politicians lie sets a worrying precedent. And yes, lack of oversight into the platform’s decisions opens up a host of plausible election interference conspiracies. But Facebook’s essential threat to democracy isn’t that Mr. Zuckerberg will intervene on behalf of his preferred candidate — it’s more fundamental than that. Mark Zuckerberg need not intervene, because Facebook, the platform, will do so instinctively. With its algorithmic mandate of engagement over all else, Facebook has redefined what it means to be a good candidate — and provided a distinct natural advantage to those who distort the truth and seek to divide.

Few politicians have evidenced this phenomenon better than President Trump, the natural Facebook candidate. He’s light on policy but heavy on the sort of sweeping imagery that translates so easily to memes (some of his memes, like “The Wall,” eventually do become policy). Almost every iteration of his messaging is the type of polarizing content that is candy for Facebook’s algorithms."

Oct. 11, 2019

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election."

The work the two men did in Ukraine for Mr. Giuliani seems to have been a mixture of business and politics. Mr. Parnas advised Mr. Giuliani on energy deals in the region and pursued his own in Ukraine even as he portrayed himself as a representative of Mr. Giuliani on the Trump-related matters.

The indictment said Mr. Parnas acted “at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.” None were named, but Ms. Yovanovitch’s main critic in the Ukrainian government was Yuriy Lutsenko, then the nation’s prosecutor general who himself has a history of wielding the law as a weapon in his personal political battles.

Both Mr. Fruman and Mr. Parnas appear to have at least glancing contacts with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump invited Mr. Fruman to a fund-raiser last year at the president’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, he said in an interview with Forum Daily, a publication that bills itself as the “voice of Russian-speaking America.” The article featured a photograph of the two men, with the president giving a thumbs-up sign.

Mr. Parnas posted a photo on Twitter this spring of himself with the president and wished Mr. Trump a happy birthday. “I am honored to call you Mr. President!!!” he wrote. “And my friend!!”

The president sought to distance himself from the men as he left the White House on Thursday en route to a political rally in Minnesota.

The scene unfolded in the course of a daylong news conference that Mr. Zelensky hosted at a food court in central Kiev, part of an effort to take back control of his narrative and refocus attention on domestic priorities amid the firestorm surrounding his interactions with President Trump.

This is not where Mr. Zelensky expected to be when he took office last May. A popular comedian and actor, who played a president on TV before he entered the race for Ukraine’s actual presidency last year, Mr. Zelenksy had anticipated becoming embroiled in ferocious battles with Ukraine’s oligarchs over endemic corruption and going head-to-head with Russia’s president, Vladimir V.

Dowd, who was not at the hearing, declined to comment. His clients were ordered to appear in court on Thursday in New York, where the charges were filed.

The work the two men did in Ukraine for Mr. Giuliani seems to have been a mixture of business and politics. Mr. Parnas advised Mr. Giuliani on energy deals in the region and pursued his own in Ukraine even as he portrayed himself as a representative of Mr. Giuliani on the Trump-related matters.

The indictment said Mr. Parnas acted “at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.” None were named, but Ms. Yovanovitch’s main critic in the Ukrainian government was Yuriy Lutsenko, then the nation’s prosecutor general who himself has a history of wielding the law as a weapon in his personal political battles.

Both Mr. Fruman and Mr. Parnas appear to have at least glancing contacts with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump invited Mr. Fruman to a fund-raiser last year at the president’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, he said in an interview with Forum Daily, a publication that bills itself as the “voice of Russian-speaking America.” The article featured a photograph of the two men, with the president giving a thumbs-up sign.

Mr. Parnas posted a photo on Twitter this spring of himself with the president and wished Mr. Trump a happy birthday. “I am honored to call you Mr. President!!!” he wrote. “And my friend!!”

The president sought to distance himself from the men as he left the White House on Thursday en route to a political rally in Minnesota.

“I don’t know those gentlemen,” Mr. Trump said. “Now it’s possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody. I don’t know about them. I don’t know what they do. I don’t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You’d have to ask Rudy.”"

Three Democratic chairmen leading the inquiry instructed Mr. Perry to turn over by next Friday any records that would shed light on President Trump’s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government to open corruption investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son. Investigators also want answers on whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine’s state-owned gas company.

Hours earlier, they demanded that two businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, appear for depositions next Wednesday and hand over records related to their work with Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. Mr. Giuliani has been the point man in the president’s pressure campaign on Ukraine, around which the inquiry is centered. The subpoenas came shortly after the two men were indicted on federal campaign finance charges that touched on their work in Ukraine.

The new subpoenas, and more in the works, sent a clear message to the White House that Democrats do not intend to back down from a growing constitutional clash over their inquiry, even after the White House defiantly said this week that it would stonewall all requests for witnesses and documents."

The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather.

Kissing babies and tousling children’s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops . In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning."

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , two associates of Rudy Giuliani , were indicted on campaign finance charges. They were part of the pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate President Trump ’s political rivals, including Joe Biden .

Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York said Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman “conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office,” including by making donations to a pro-Trump super PAC. Read the indictment.

The indictment refers to a “Congressman-1” — identified in campaign finance filings as former Representative Pete Sessions , Republican of Texas — who was the beneficiary of approximately $3 million that the super PAC spent during the 2018 cycle. The men sought Mr. Sessions’s assistance in removing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, “at least in part at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,” according to the indictment. (The men were also seeking political assistance setting up a legal marijuana business in Nevada.)

Shortly after the indictment became public, House impeachment investigators issued subpoenas to Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, compelling them to speak with Congress about their work with Mr. Giuliani in Ukraine.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry was subpoenaed for records that could shed light on any role he may have played in Mr. Trump’s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government. Investigators also want to know whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine’s state-owned gas company.

The passengers took them out, and the officers determined who was standing in front of them. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were told to turn around. As they made their way back into the terminal, they were greeted by a phalanx of uniformed and plainclothes officers who arrested them.

Eric Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, said there was a distinction between his father’s career in business, with his recent turn to politics, and Mr. Biden’s decades in public office.

The current controversy stems from two separate but related events. The first revolves around leaked audio of Mark Zuckerberg speaking privately to employees at recent town hall meetings, where he called Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plans to break up Facebook an “existential” threat to the company and one he would fight. The second is a recent announcement by Facebook that it is exempting political figures from its policy forbidding spreading misinformation in advertisements (yes, politicians spreading false claims in their ads is just a part of the political conversation, according to Facebook).

Both developments have attracted the ire of Warren who, in a series of tweets this week, argued that the public has a right to know how Facebook “intends to use their influence in this election” and implied that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook might be intentionally emboldening the Trump campaign by relaxing advertising rules. Fellow Democrats echoed the concerns: Seema Nanda, C.E.O. of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that the social network’s ad policy “is a serious missed opportunity by Facebook.” At the same time, old fears that the company’s “I Voted” button, which has proved effective at boosting get-out-the-vote efforts, could give an outsize advantage to Mr. Trump are recirculating.

But Ms. Warren’s concerns miss a key point about the social network’s roles in elections.

Yes, Facebook’s willingness to let politicians lie sets a worrying precedent. And yes, lack of oversight into the platform’s decisions opens up a host of plausible election interference conspiracies. But Facebook’s essential threat to democracy isn’t that Mr. Zuckerberg will intervene on behalf of his preferred candidate — it’s more fundamental than that. Mark Zuckerberg need not intervene, because Facebook, the platform, will do so instinctively. With its algorithmic mandate of engagement over all else, Facebook has redefined what it means to be a good candidate — and provided a distinct natural advantage to those who distort the truth and seek to divide.

Few politicians have evidenced this phenomenon better than President Trump, the natural Facebook candidate. He’s light on policy but heavy on the sort of sweeping imagery that translates so easily to memes (some of his memes, like “The Wall,” eventually do become policy). Almost every iteration of his messaging is the type of polarizing content that is candy for Facebook’s algorithms."

Ms. Yovanovitch said people associated with Rudy Giuliani , Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, “may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”

Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, like Ms. Yovanovitch, agreed to comply with a House subpoena and testify, defying a State Department order not to appear.

What Marie Yovanovitch is thinking

Ms. Yovanovitch delivered her searing account before Congress at the risk of losing her job, since the White House has ordered officials not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. This afternoon I stopped by the desk of Sharon LaFraniere, who has written about Ms. Yovanovitch, to discuss why the former ambassador to Ukraine was so intent on speaking out.

Sharon, how unusual was her participation? And how unusual was her testimony?

She testified despite a White House declaration that there would be no more cooperation with Congress. She’s acting in defiance of the White House. Her testimony today was a really damning indictment of how the Trump administration is conducting foreign policy. She warned against people who in search of personal gain or private influence undermined the work of American government officials and threatened the policy goals of the United States. And on top of all that, she said the State Department is being hollowed out from within, because diplomats don’t feel the government has their back.

What does she know that House Democrats want to know?

She seemed to suggest that businesspeople who are allies of Rudy Giuliani may have orchestrated this campaign to get her out for their own private gain. Was she removed because she was standing in the way of some sort of quid pro quo deal that the White House was planning to execute? Did they see her as unwilling to play ball in what might have been a corrupt game? Those are the questions impeachment investigators want to answer."

michael barbaro

As Congress returns from recess, the impeachment inquiry enters a pivotal phase, and the White House strategy to block the investigation begins to crumble, with five administration officials set to testify before House committees.

speaker Washington? elisabeth bumiller O.K., so we’ve got Fiona Hill, the former Russia expert on the National Security Council staff, on the Hill as we speak. She’s behind closed doors.

michael barbaro

On Monday, those committees heard testimony about why the president removed the longtime ambassador to Ukraine just two months before his fateful call with the president of Ukraine asking for a favor.

elisabeth bumiller It’s busy week on the Hill. He’s going to testify. On Thursday, we’ve got another State Department official testifying. Tomorrow —

michael barbaro

Today: The story of how that ambassador ended up at the center of the impeachment process. It’s Tuesday, October 15.

michael barbaro So are you ready for “Daily” retrieval? sharon lafraniere I am. Where do we go? michael barbaro We’re going to go down to six. sharon lafraniere O.K., into that — to that dark room? michael barbaro That dark, sweaty room. sharon lafraniere Yeah, is it sweaty? All right. michael barbaro No, it’s not too sweaty.

michael barbaro

Sharon LaFraniere is an investigative reporter in the Washington bureau.

sharon lafraniere

O.K., go ahead.

michael barbaro

And we’ll jump in. And it’ll be great. Sharon, tell us about this ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch.

sharon lafraniere

So she’s a very experienced diplomat.

archived recording — Marie Yovanovitch to be ambassador to the Republic of Armenia.

sharon lafraniere

She’s a 33-year veteran of the State Department. She’s a three-time ambassador. George W. Bush appointed her to be ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and then to Armenia.

archived recording (marie yovanovitch) It’s an honor for me to appear before you today. I’m honored, also, by the confidence that President Bush and Secretary Rice have shown in me by nominating me for the post of U.S. ambassador to Armenia.

sharon lafraniere

And then in August of 2016, President Obama appointed her to be ambassador to Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So she’s a career diplomat.

sharon lafraniere

She’s a career diplomat. And her sort of trademark, what people mostly say about her, is how cautious she is. She is a very careful diplomat.

archived recording (marie yovanovitch) U.S. policy is very clear. Crimea is a part of Ukraine. And we are absolutely rock solid on that.

sharon lafraniere

You know, she doesn’t get out over her skis. She’s very, very policy-oriented, very attentive to protocol, propriety, instructions, and just by nature, a cautious person.

archived recording (marie yovanovitch) And we are very active on the diplomatic side to ensure that Russia’s physical occupation of Crimea does not become sort of a creeping occupation through other ways.

sharon lafraniere

By the time Trump’s elected, she’s ambassador to Ukraine. She’s been in the embassy as ambassador then for about six months or so, and she continues on. Trump is the sixth president that she has served.

michael barbaro

Of both parties.

sharon lafraniere

Of both parties, correct.

archived recording (marie yovanovitch) There has been a strong bipartisan commitment to Ukraine’s independence, and I’m confident that will continue.

michael barbaro

So what happens after President Trump renews her ambassadorship?

sharon lafraniere

She carries on, and early March, she gets this communiqué from the State Department saying, hey, can you stand? Can we extend your ambassadorship into 2020? And then less than two months later, she gets another communiqué from the State Department, which basically is, word for word, get on the next plane to Washington. And her ambassadorship, at that point, is over.

michael barbaro

So she’s asked to stay on.

sharon lafraniere

She’s asked to stand.

michael barbaro

And within weeks, she’s told she’s finished.

sharon lafraniere

Exactly.

michael barbaro

And at the time, how much notice does this attract, the fact that she’s essentially fired?

sharon lafraniere

Very little. We didn’t write a thing about it.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

sharon lafraniere

I mean, I guess generally, we don’t pay that much attention to ambassadors. They carry out policy. They don’t set policy, so —

michael barbaro

But, of course, we’re paying attention now.

sharon lafraniere

Right. And the question is, was she removed from her job because she somehow or another stood in the way of a kind of corrupt quid pro quo deal that the White House had going with Ukraine? And so more and more is coming out now about why she was recalled so abruptly to Washington. And witness after witness is being asked, what do you know about the whole campaign to drive out Marie Yovanovitch?

michael barbaro

And what have we learned from those witnesses, from this testimony?

sharon lafraniere

So let me take you back to last year, because that’s when it began.

[music]

michael barbaro

Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, had two associates who were working with him and for him in Ukraine. So that’s Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. They are both U.S. citizens, but they’re working with Giuliani. But they are also working for themselves, for their own personal interests. They are going after Yovanovitch because they think that she is an obstacle to their effort to get a deal with the state-owned gas company that’s run by the Ukraine. And it’s been turned down by the chief executive of this company. And he is a reform-minded executive, and the ambassador is supporting him, and they want to get him out, and they want to get her out, too. O.K., let me just try to understand.

sharon lafraniere

O.K., two —

michael barbaro

Two men who work with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s private lawyer, they are trying to make a buck in Ukraine. They want to do a deal with an energy company there. They’re having some trouble. They blame the C.E.O. of that company for standing in their way, and they simultaneously blame Yovanovitch. Why did they blame her? What’s the connection?

sharon lafraniere

American diplomats have always paid attention to Ukraine’s energy policy, because energy is sort of this nexus in which Russia tries to exert influence over Ukraine, and basically, it’s a font of corruption. So the U.S. has always been saying, you know, you need good governance here in your state energy company. So that’s what Yovanovitch was saying. No more backroom deals. You need good governance in this company.

michael barbaro

And how does Giuliani come into the picture?

sharon lafraniere

O.K., so —

michael barbaro

You must have, like, a whiteboard —

sharon lafraniere

Yeah, right.

michael barbaro

— where you keep track of all these characters.

sharon lafraniere

It is. Well, O.K., there’s a parallel track, too, right? There’s another guy, Yuriy Lutsenko. This is a guy who isn’t even a lawyer, but he’s running the prosecutor’s office. He’s also against her, because she’s telling him that you got to clean up the corruption in your prosecutor general’s office. And so she’s putting pressure on him, and he doesn’t like that either. Right? So she’s got these enemies with these two associates of Giuliani. She’s got this enemy in this prosecutor. And all three of those guys sort of join up together along with Giuliani.

michael barbaro

So just to complete this set of characters that you have brought on stage — you have Giuliani’s associates, you have the prosecutor in Ukraine, you have Rudy Giuliani. All of them begin to see a common foe in this U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who sees herself as somebody trying to fight corruption and bad business practices in Ukraine.

sharon lafraniere

Right. And they start to spread stories about her that she is disloyal to Trump.

archived recording — Marie Yovanovitch. Yovanovitch, an Obama holdover, remains in the post today. She’s reportedly demonstrated clear anti-Trump bias.

sharon lafraniere

That there are private recordings in which she is supposedly disdainful to Trump.

archived recording She is known and reported by people there to have bad-mouthed the president of the United States, Donald Trump, to have told Ukrainians not to listen to him or obey his policy because he was going to be impeached.

sharon lafraniere

So while they’re working in Ukraine, they’re also exporting this campaign against her to the U.S. One person who they approach is Pete Sessions —

archived recording (barack obama) I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear. archived recording (pete sessions) Remember that? It looked bleak. The press said conservatives were an endangered species. I said it was time to get to work.

sharon lafraniere

— who is then a Republican congressman from Texas who’s running for re-election.

archived recording (pete sessions) But I’m not finished yet. We have to roll back the Obama agenda and get businesses hiring nationwide. I’m Pete Sessions, and I approve this message.

sharon lafraniere

He is head of the House Rules Committee, so he has a pretty important position. And they say, we are going to help you raise $20,000 for your re-election campaign. And we also want your help in getting Yovanovitch out. So Sessions then does write a letter to Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and says, this ambassador’s disloyal to Trump.

michael barbaro

Wow.

sharon lafraniere

And that’s really the beginning of the whole campaign against her in the U.S.

michael barbaro

So these men, after successfully spreading the word that Yovanovitch is no good, in their telling, in Ukraine, they are asking a member of the United States Congress to try to discredit her within the government of the U.S., and he does it.

sharon lafraniere

Yes. By this spring, it’s really sort of hit a fever pitch.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

sharon lafraniere

Well, in that Donald Trump Jr. gets on Twitter and says, we have to get rid of more of these joker ambassadors like her.

michael barbaro

Mentions her.

sharon lafraniere

Yeah, mentions her. And four days later, Giuliani takes a whole packet of information about her, which he’s gathered from these three guys, and puts it in Mike Pompeo’s hands — Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state. Right?

michael barbaro

Wow.

sharon lafraniere

And says, this is a bad ambassador. You have to investigate this.

michael barbaro

And the result of that is that Mike Pompeo, secretary of state, has this letter from this Republican lawmaker, and he has this packet of negative information about Yovanovitch from Giuliani. And, of course, Pompeo is Yovanovitch’s boss.

sharon lafraniere

Correct.

michael barbaro

So this campaign is coming from a lot of angles.

sharon lafraniere

Right.

michael barbaro

O.K., so what happens next?

[music]

sharon lafraniere

So next, it’s late April, and she gets that letter from the State Department or some kind of communiqué from the State Department, get on the next plane to Washington. And her boss is about to tell her that her ambassadorship is going to be cut short.

michael barbaro

And what kind of explanation is given?

sharon lafraniere

So the explanation is you haven’t done anything wrong. This is the deputy secretary of state saying this. This isn’t like normal cases when ambassadors are recalled for cause. In other words, you’ve done something really terrible, and we’re — you haven’t done anything wrong.

michael barbaro

He says that to her?

sharon lafraniere

Yes, he says that to her, according to her. But there’s been a campaign against you, a very concerted campaign against you for a long time, and we’ve been under pressure from the president to remove you since the summer of 2018. So we’re bringing you home.

michael barbaro

He sounds almost embarrassed.

sharon lafraniere

Yeah, apologetic, maybe.

michael barbaro

Hmm, so she just leaves the job.

sharon lafraniere

Yep, she leaves the job. And there is a reaction — we don’t know it at the time — but there is a pretty strong reaction within the State Department.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

sharon lafraniere

Well, at the embassy back in Kiev, the officials who are left there are said to be seething about this, that this is really unusual. This is really bizarre.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording Marie Yovanovitch, I learned this evening that the president has ordered her dismissal from her post as the United States ambassador to Ukraine as a result of her activities there, which were complained of by Congressman Sessions. She —

michael barbaro

Sharon, so are we to understand, at this point, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told the president that he thinks Yovanovitch should go, and that that would suggest that the information Pompeo has received from this Republican congressman and from this packet of information from Giuliani, that this was effective?

sharon lafraniere

So we don’t know whether Pompeo told the president that she should go. It could be that the president told Pompeo she should go. We do know Rudy wanted her to go. So maybe Rudy is the key adviser. Maybe he tells the president this is somebody who’s disloyal to you, and the president tells Pompeo, get rid of her. It could have been that way, too.

michael barbaro

So all we know is that the president removes her from this job.

sharon lafraniere

Right. And we know that the State Department said that they were under pressure from the president to remove her for more than a year earlier.

michael barbaro

And what happens after she’s removed from this job?

sharon lafraniere

So about two months after she’s removed from the job, the president and Zelensky, the new Ukrainian president, have this now-famous phone call July 25, and she comes up —

michael barbaro

Yovanovitch.

sharon lafraniere

— in the phone call, yes. And the president says, “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news, and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news, so I just wanted to let you know that.” And then Zelensky agrees with Trump and says, “It was great that you were the first one who told me she was a bad ambassador, because I agree with you 100 percent.” And then President Trump says, “Well, she’s going to go through some things,” which sounds quite ominous.

michael barbaro

So whether the fact that the president got rid of the ambassador to Ukraine before turning up the pressure on Ukraine is kind of an open question. We don’t know yet.

sharon lafraniere

It is an open question.

michael barbaro

But It happened two months before this pivotal phone call.

sharon lafraniere

Right, which makes you wonder, was somebody trying to get her out of the way? We just don’t know.

michael barbaro

Right.

sharon lafraniere

She doesn’t know, I don’t think.

michael barbaro

So that Zelensky-Trump telephone call, of course, has led to the impeachment inquiry. Where has Yovanovitch fit in to the inquiry?

sharon lafraniere

So she’s going to be at the top of the witness list, right? But the question is, she is still a career official within the State Department.

michael barbaro

Because she’s fired from her job, but not from the department.

sharon lafraniere

Right. So she’s just lying low, and then her name shows up on the witness list. And the House impeachment investigators really want to get her in there and find out what happened. But the White House comes out with this letter saying, we’re not cooperating, the administration is not cooperating. So we’re all wondering is she going to show up, or she’s not going to show up?

michael barbaro

Does that apply to her?

sharon lafraniere

Yeah, no, it definitely applies to her. If the administration is not cooperating, she shouldn’t be cooperating, right? So most of us, I think, are figuring she’s not going to show up. She’s been told not to show up. And then we learn, you know, not too many hours before her testimony that she is showing up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

speaker Are you represented by State Department counsel, or are you —

sharon lafraniere

She’s showing up. And she walks through the entrance rather firmly flanked by her lawyer, and she disappears into the secure chambers where the House Intelligence Committee investigators begin to question her, and she doesn’t come out until dark. She testified for nearly nine hours in defiance of the White House directive.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. And what do we know about what she says?

sharon lafraniere

We got her opening statement, and it was, I thought, extremely dramatic. I was particularly struck by this one sentence that she wrote, which was, “Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was, nevertheless, incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.” All these things that have been swirling around about me are completely false. The notion I ever said, ignore President Trump’s orders because he’s going to be impeached anyway — I never said such a thing to my embassy colleagues or to anyone else. And then she gets to Giuliani, who she says she thinks she’s met maybe three times. O.K., “I do not know Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me.” But individuals, people named as his associates, may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were being stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine. In other words, maybe Giuliani’s friends thought that I was standing in the way of them putting money in their pocket. Maybe that’s what it is about. And she says more broadly that the U.S. foreign policy is going to be in a really bad state if we allow private interests to “circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good.” So she’s making a very, very important and broad point about this, is that this is not just about me. It’s chaos in the diplomatic scene. You have an ambassador who — the State Department doesn’t have her back. And she’s being discredited by the president’s own personal lawyer and then, later, by the president himself, in this phone call with the Ukrainian president. And that’s not just a, you know, cautionary tale about her. That’s a tale for a lot of diplomats who put themselves in harm’s way to serve the nation, as she says. So she doesn’t mention Mike Pompeo by name, but it’s clear that she feels that the State Department didn’t stand up for her and should have. She’s raising serious issues there, but they’re not really political issues, they’re issues of good governance and good administration.

michael barbaro

But to many people listening, her removal from this position as ambassador is providing a lot of ammunition to what has become a pretty political matter, which is the impeachment inquiry.

sharon lafraniere

Right. So the question about how did she lose her job? Why did she lose her job? Who drove her out? This is really central to the inquiry. And even if she didn’t provide the answers because maybe she doesn’t really know, other people are going to be asked about it. And beyond the issue of what she does know or doesn’t know, did say or didn’t say, just the fact that she showed up alone is significant, really remarkable.

michael barbaro

And testified.

sharon lafraniere

And testified. Are more people like her going to follow suit? Are they going to say, you know, we don’t care what the White House says, we’re making our own decision? And one example of that is Gordon Sondland, who is the U.S. ambassador for the European Union. First, he was going to testify. Then the White House, the State Department directed him not to testify, so he was taken off the schedule. And now he’s back on the schedule because he wants to testify for his own reasons, which are probably that he doesn’t want to be painted as the bad guy in this. So he’s worried about his own reputation.

michael barbaro

I’m curious what’s happened to all of the people who worked so hard to discredit Yovanovitch and ended up getting her removed from this job. What has happened to them?

archived recording Parnas and Fruman were arrested around 6:00 p.m. last night at Dulles Airport as they were about to board an international flight with one-way tickets.

sharon lafraniere

michael barbaro

And, of course, the president is being investigated in an impeachment inquiry.

sharon lafraniere

Right. Some people who went after her are going through some things.

michael barbaro

[CHUCKLES] Sharon, thank you very much.

sharon lafraniere

Thank you for having me.

michael barbaro

The Times reports that in closed-door testimony on Monday, President Trump’s former top adviser on Russia, Fiona Hill, testified that she strongly objected to the removal of Marie Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine, but that her advice was ignored. Hill recounted that Rudy Giuliani’s conduct was so alarming that national security adviser John Bolton told her to alert White House lawyers about it, and that Bolton described Giuliani as, quote, “a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up.” Despite objections from the White House, the leaders of the impeachment inquiry are scheduled to hear from several more State Department officials over the coming days, including the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, and the ambassador to the European Union, who became deeply involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Trump’s rivals. We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

michael barbaro O.K., Eric Schmitt, can I just ask you about what happened in Syria on Monday? eric schmitt So three main things happened in Syria on Monday. The first is the Turkish offensive continued, continued deeper into Syrian territory. The second thing that happened was that the Syrian Kurds, who’d been allied to the Americans, they’d cut a deal with a new partner: President Assad, the Syrian government. And so Syrian government troops started moving into the territory that the Kurds used to hold. In response to all this — archived recording (steven mnuchin) The president announced that there would be sanctions forthcoming if Turkey moved forward with these actions. eric schmitt The United States finally acts, and that the president announces there’ll be economic sanctions against Turkey for what it’s done. archived recording (steven mnuchin) So effective immediately, we have sanctioned three of the ministers — the minister of defense, the minister of interior, and the minister of energy. eric schmitt But American officials I talked to today, particularly military officers who have served over in northeastern Syria, said it’s too little, too late. The sanctions, at this point, doesn’t matter. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of people will be displaced. ISIS fighters are breaking out of jails left and right. And all this has happened just a little over in the last week. archived recording (mike pence) President Trump made it very clear that the United States is going to continue to take actions against Turkey’s economy until they bring the violence to an end. We want an immediate cease fire, and we want to begin negotiations between Turkey and Syrian defense forces. We have great concerns about civilian populations.

Ms. Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators on Friday that a top State Department official had told her that Mr. Trump had pushed for her removal for months even though her employer, the State Department, believed she had “done nothing wrong.”

She dismissed as “fictitious” accusations that she had been disloyal to Mr. Trump, which she said had been circulated by allies of Mr. Giuliani.

Ms. Yovanovitch, testifying in defiance of State Department orders and at risk of losing her job, delivered a scathing indictment of how the Trump administration conducts foreign policy, warning that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats’ judgment and could undermine the nation’s interests.

Ms. Yovanovitch said of her time in Ukraine: “Our efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen. Sadly, someone was listening, and our nation is the worse off for that.”"

Facing impeachment in the House, Mr. Trump took his case to his core supporters, arguing that Democrats were trying to overturn the 2016 election because they knew they could not beat him in 2020. He singled out former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as nothing but a toady for President Barack Obama.

“He was only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass,” Mr. Trump said, a line that drew huge roars of approval from the crowd.

In his first campaign rally since Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry last month, Mr. Trump was as raw and rancorous as ever, targeting individual Democrats in highly personal terms that no president has used in public and presenting himself as a victim of a partisan conspiracy."

He suffers delusions of grandeur, proclaiming himself “the Chosen One” and having “great and unmatched wisdom.” He accuses those who challenge him of treason, and he regularly wipes his feet on the constitutional principle of checks and balances.

Witness the over-the-top letter his White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, sent House Democrats this week, the gist of which was: Your impeachment investigation is illegitimate, and we will not participate. As if this were the president’s prerogative. Legal experts mostly dismissed the letter as a political stunt. Gregg Nunziata, a former counsel to Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, called it “bananas.” Walter Shaub, who resigned as head of the Office of Government Ethics in 2017 over the administration’s glaring lack of ethics, said that it “mistakes Trump for a king.”

Fortunately, Mr. Trump’s dreams of dominance tend to bump up against the hard realities of incompetence — his and that of his cronies. It has long been apparent that the president has a peculiar eye for talent. The repercussions of this were on display this week as the Ukraine scandal at the heart of the impeachment inquiry continued to unspool, spotlighting a fresh batch of colorful characters and questionable behavior.

In one of the more bizarre impeachment twists to date, two businessmen involved in the president’s efforts to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden were arrested on campaign finance violation charges as they were trying to leave the country on Wednesday. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are Soviet-born naturalized Americans who have been working closely with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, to investigate Mr. Biden, one of the president’s chief political rivals, and his son Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine.

Oct. 11, 2019

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election."

As our colleagues Sydney Ember and Jonathan Martin reported, Mr. Sanders’s wife, Jane, his most trusted adviser, has helped shape the campaign’s response.

Republicans are attacking Warren

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became “visibly pregnant” at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her.

This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting — and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread.

The candidates talked L.G.B.T.Q. rights

CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder.

You can read about the forum here.

Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president."

Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.

And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.

That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.

Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”

Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.

But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.

The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person."

Amid it all, Mr. Trump left again for the campaign trail, which he has long employed as a useful conduit for his most provocative language, particularly when he feels the confines of Washington closing in.

Upon landing, he announced the departure of Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security who had publicly expressed frustration with the job in recent weeks. Once the president took the stage in this southwestern corner of the state, he defended himself against those pursuing impeachment, singling out Ms. Pelosi and Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

Mr. Schiff’s decision during a committee hearing to liken the president’s remarks in the July 25 call to a mobster issuing a veiled threat drew the president’s ire on Friday, as it had for weeks.

“He made it up: It was fiction,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t know, congressman, are you immune from something like that? That should be a crime.”

Throughout the rally, Mr. Trump seemed to abruptly switch emotional channels. He toggled between lashing out at Democrats to acting out an imagined back-and-forth between two former F.B.I. officials, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, in order to mock them for exchanging unflattering text messages about Mr. Trump during his candidacy. He also paused at one point to interview Little League ballplayers about their pitching speeds.

Eventually, he circled back to his original purpose for the visit: testing his political influence over local races ahead of Saturday’s primary election, largely following the same attack-style playbook he deployed last month in a close North Carolina race."

The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather.

Kissing babies and tousling children’s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops . In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning."

“Look, you can try to contort anything into anything, but if they have any degree of objectivity or fairness, it would be kind of ridiculous to say I was doing it on Lutsenko’s behalf when I was representing the president of the United States,” Mr. Giuliani said.

Eric Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, said there was a distinction between his father’s career in business, with his recent turn to politics, and Mr. Biden’s decades in public office.

“We’ve been exporting our corruption to them, rather than trying to export good governance,” said Fukuyama.

When he said that, Fukuyama may not have known how right he was. A few hours after I met Leshchenko, news broke that two Ukrainian-born clients of Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, had been arrested on charges of campaign finance crimes as they were preparing to leave the United States with one-way tickets.

According to an indictment, the two “sought to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.” (In one of those preposterously on-the-nose details that make the Trump era feel like a computer simulation on the fritz, Parnas had a company called Fraud Guarantee.)

As soon as news of the indictment broke, I messaged Leshchenko, who guessed that the unnamed Ukrainian official was Lutsenko. It was a natural assumption; it had already been reported that Parnas and Fruman connected Giuliani with Lutsenko, who had been feeding Trump’s lawyer conspiracy theories about the journalist, the former American ambassador and Joe Biden.

Sure enough, on Saturday NBC News reported that Lutsenko was the official in the indictment. Yovanovitch might have been referring to Lutsenko when she said, in her Friday congressional testimony, that “individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”

Thanks to Giuliani’s escapades, the domestic grudges of a crooked Ukrainian prosecutor have blossomed into a scandal that’s likely to lead to the impeachment of an American president. Federal prosecutors are now investigating whether Giuliani himself broke the law."

For Facebook, the situation is tricky. The social media company has struggled in recent years with what to allow and disallow on its site, especially after revelations that Russian operatives used the platform during the 2016 presidential election to post disinformation to inflame the American electorate. Facebook has moved to clamp down on false content. Yet when the company removes or buries messages, ads, photos and videos, it is often called out for bias and censorship. Facebook has faced particular wrath from conservatives, who have said the social network intentionally suppresses what they say.

“Facebook believes political speech should be protected,” a spokesman for Facebook said on Saturday. “If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.”

Truth in social media advertising is likely to become a bigger issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to speak about Facebook’s political speech policies this coming week at Georgetown University.

Ms. Yovanovitch said people associated with Rudy Giuliani , Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, “may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”

Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, like Ms. Yovanovitch, agreed to comply with a House subpoena and testify, defying a State Department order not to appear.

What Marie Yovanovitch is thinking

Ms. Yovanovitch delivered her searing account before Congress at the risk of losing her job, since the White House has ordered officials not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. This afternoon I stopped by the desk of Sharon LaFraniere, who has written about Ms. Yovanovitch, to discuss why the former ambassador to Ukraine was so intent on speaking out.

Sharon, how unusual was her participation? And how unusual was her testimony?

She testified despite a White House declaration that there would be no more cooperation with Congress. She’s acting in defiance of the White House. Her testimony today was a really damning indictment of how the Trump administration is conducting foreign policy. She warned against people who in search of personal gain or private influence undermined the work of American government officials and threatened the policy goals of the United States. And on top of all that, she said the State Department is being hollowed out from within, because diplomats don’t feel the government has their back.

What does she know that House Democrats want to know?

She seemed to suggest that businesspeople who are allies of Rudy Giuliani may have orchestrated this campaign to get her out for their own private gain. Was she removed because she was standing in the way of some sort of quid pro quo deal that the White House was planning to execute? Did they see her as unwilling to play ball in what might have been a corrupt game? Those are the questions impeachment investigators want to answer."

michael barbaro

Sharon LaFraniere is an investigative reporter in the Washington bureau.

sharon lafraniere

O.K., go ahead.

michael barbaro

And we’ll jump in. And it’ll be great. Sharon, tell us about this ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch.

sharon lafraniere

So she’s a very experienced diplomat.

archived recording — Marie Yovanovitch to be ambassador to the Republic of Armenia.

sharon lafraniere

She’s a 33-year veteran of the State Department. She’s a three-time ambassador. George W. Bush appointed her to be ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and then to Armenia.

archived recording (marie yovanovitch) It’s an honor for me to appear before you today. I’m honored, also, by the confidence that President Bush and Secretary Rice have shown in me by nominating me for the post of U.S. ambassador to Armenia.

sharon lafraniere

And then in August of 2016, President Obama appointed her to be ambassador to Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So she’s a career diplomat.

sharon lafraniere

She’s a career diplomat. And her sort of trademark, what people mostly say about her, is how cautious she is. She is a very careful diplomat.

archived recording (marie yovanovitch) U.S. policy is very clear. Crimea is a part of Ukraine. And we are absolutely rock solid on that.

sharon lafraniere

You know, she doesn’t get out over her skis. She’s very, very policy-oriented, very attentive to protocol, propriety, instructions, and just by nature, a cautious person.

archived recording (marie yovanovitch) And we are very active on the diplomatic side to ensure that Russia’s physical occupation of Crimea does not become sort of a creeping occupation through other ways.

sharon lafraniere

By the time Trump’s elected, she’s ambassador to Ukraine. She’s been in the embassy as ambassador then for about six months or so, and she continues on. Trump is the sixth president that she has served.

michael barbaro

Of both parties.

sharon lafraniere

Of both parties, correct.

archived recording (marie yovanovitch) There has been a strong bipartisan commitment to Ukraine’s independence, and I’m confident that will continue.

michael barbaro

So what happens after President Trump renews her ambassadorship?

sharon lafraniere

She carries on, and early March, she gets this communiqué from the State Department saying, hey, can you stand? Can we extend your ambassadorship into 2020? And then less than two months later, she gets another communiqué from the State Department, which basically is, word for word, get on the next plane to Washington. And her ambassadorship, at that point, is over.

michael barbaro

So she’s asked to stay on.

sharon lafraniere

She’s asked to stand.

michael barbaro

And within weeks, she’s told she’s finished.

sharon lafraniere

Exactly.

michael barbaro

And at the time, how much notice does this attract, the fact that she’s essentially fired?

sharon lafraniere

Very little. We didn’t write a thing about it.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

sharon lafraniere

I mean, I guess generally, we don’t pay that much attention to ambassadors. They carry out policy. They don’t set policy, so —

michael barbaro

But, of course, we’re paying attention now.

sharon lafraniere

Right. And the question is, was she removed from her job because she somehow or another stood in the way of a kind of corrupt quid pro quo deal that the White House had going with Ukraine? And so more and more is coming out now about why she was recalled so abruptly to Washington. And witness after witness is being asked, what do you know about the whole campaign to drive out Marie Yovanovitch?

michael barbaro

And what have we learned from those witnesses, from this testimony?

sharon lafraniere

So let me take you back to last year, because that’s when it began.

[music]

michael barbaro

Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, had two associates who were working with him and for him in Ukraine. So that’s Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. They are both U.S. citizens, but they’re working with Giuliani. But they are also working for themselves, for their own personal interests. They are going after Yovanovitch because they think that she is an obstacle to their effort to get a deal with the state-owned gas company that’s run by the Ukraine. And it’s been turned down by the chief executive of this company. And he is a reform-minded executive, and the ambassador is supporting him, and they want to get him out, and they want to get her out, too. O.K., let me just try to understand.

sharon lafraniere

O.K., two —

michael barbaro

Two men who work with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s private lawyer, they are trying to make a buck in Ukraine. They want to do a deal with an energy company there. They’re having some trouble. They blame the C.E.O. of that company for standing in their way, and they simultaneously blame Yovanovitch. Why did they blame her? What’s the connection?

sharon lafraniere

American diplomats have always paid attention to Ukraine’s energy policy, because energy is sort of this nexus in which Russia tries to exert influence over Ukraine, and basically, it’s a font of corruption. So the U.S. has always been saying, you know, you need good governance here in your state energy company. So that’s what Yovanovitch was saying. No more backroom deals. You need good governance in this company.

michael barbaro

And how does Giuliani come into the picture?

sharon lafraniere

O.K., so —

michael barbaro

You must have, like, a whiteboard —

sharon lafraniere

Yeah, right.

michael barbaro

— where you keep track of all these characters.

sharon lafraniere

It is. Well, O.K., there’s a parallel track, too, right? There’s another guy, Yuriy Lutsenko. This is a guy who isn’t even a lawyer, but he’s running the prosecutor’s office. He’s also against her, because she’s telling him that you got to clean up the corruption in your prosecutor general’s office. And so she’s putting pressure on him, and he doesn’t like that either. Right? So she’s got these enemies with these two associates of Giuliani. She’s got this enemy in this prosecutor. And all three of those guys sort of join up together along with Giuliani.

michael barbaro

So just to complete this set of characters that you have brought on stage — you have Giuliani’s associates, you have the prosecutor in Ukraine, you have Rudy Giuliani. All of them begin to see a common foe in this U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who sees herself as somebody trying to fight corruption and bad business practices in Ukraine.

sharon lafraniere

Right. And they start to spread stories about her that she is disloyal to Trump.

archived recording — Marie Yovanovitch. Yovanovitch, an Obama holdover, remains in the post today. She’s reportedly demonstrated clear anti-Trump bias.

sharon lafraniere

That there are private recordings in which she is supposedly disdainful to Trump.

archived recording She is known and reported by people there to have bad-mouthed the president of the United States, Donald Trump, to have told Ukrainians not to listen to him or obey his policy because he was going to be impeached.

sharon lafraniere

So while they’re working in Ukraine, they’re also exporting this campaign against her to the U.S. One person who they approach is Pete Sessions —

archived recording (barack obama) I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear. archived recording (pete sessions) Remember that? It looked bleak. The press said conservatives were an endangered species. I said it was time to get to work.

sharon lafraniere

— who is then a Republican congressman from Texas who’s running for re-election.

archived recording (pete sessions) But I’m not finished yet. We have to roll back the Obama agenda and get businesses hiring nationwide. I’m Pete Sessions, and I approve this message.

sharon lafraniere

He is head of the House Rules Committee, so he has a pretty important position. And they say, we are going to help you raise $20,000 for your re-election campaign. And we also want your help in getting Yovanovitch out. So Sessions then does write a letter to Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and says, this ambassador’s disloyal to Trump.

michael barbaro

Wow.

sharon lafraniere

And that’s really the beginning of the whole campaign against her in the U.S.

michael barbaro

So these men, after successfully spreading the word that Yovanovitch is no good, in their telling, in Ukraine, they are asking a member of the United States Congress to try to discredit her within the government of the U.S., and he does it.

sharon lafraniere

Yes. By this spring, it’s really sort of hit a fever pitch.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

sharon lafraniere

Well, in that Donald Trump Jr. gets on Twitter and says, we have to get rid of more of these joker ambassadors like her.

michael barbaro

Mentions her.

sharon lafraniere

Yeah, mentions her. And four days later, Giuliani takes a whole packet of information about her, which he’s gathered from these three guys, and puts it in Mike Pompeo’s hands — Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state. Right?

michael barbaro

Wow.

sharon lafraniere

And says, this is a bad ambassador. You have to investigate this.

michael barbaro

And the result of that is that Mike Pompeo, secretary of state, has this letter from this Republican lawmaker, and he has this packet of negative information about Yovanovitch from Giuliani. And, of course, Pompeo is Yovanovitch’s boss.

sharon lafraniere

Correct.

michael barbaro

So this campaign is coming from a lot of angles.

sharon lafraniere

Right.

michael barbaro

O.K., so what happens next?

[music]

sharon lafraniere

So next, it’s late April, and she gets that letter from the State Department or some kind of communiqué from the State Department, get on the next plane to Washington. And her boss is about to tell her that her ambassadorship is going to be cut short.

michael barbaro

And what kind of explanation is given?

sharon lafraniere

So the explanation is you haven’t done anything wrong. This is the deputy secretary of state saying this. This isn’t like normal cases when ambassadors are recalled for cause. In other words, you’ve done something really terrible, and we’re — you haven’t done anything wrong.

michael barbaro

He says that to her?

sharon lafraniere

Yes, he says that to her, according to her. But there’s been a campaign against you, a very concerted campaign against you for a long time, and we’ve been under pressure from the president to remove you since the summer of 2018. So we’re bringing you home.

michael barbaro

He sounds almost embarrassed.

sharon lafraniere

Yeah, apologetic, maybe.

michael barbaro

Hmm, so she just leaves the job.

sharon lafraniere

Yep, she leaves the job. And there is a reaction — we don’t know it at the time — but there is a pretty strong reaction within the State Department.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

sharon lafraniere

Well, at the embassy back in Kiev, the officials who are left there are said to be seething about this, that this is really unusual. This is really bizarre.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording Marie Yovanovitch, I learned this evening that the president has ordered her dismissal from her post as the United States ambassador to Ukraine as a result of her activities there, which were complained of by Congressman Sessions. She —

michael barbaro

Sharon, so are we to understand, at this point, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told the president that he thinks Yovanovitch should go, and that that would suggest that the information Pompeo has received from this Republican congressman and from this packet of information from Giuliani, that this was effective?

sharon lafraniere

So we don’t know whether Pompeo told the president that she should go. It could be that the president told Pompeo she should go. We do know Rudy wanted her to go. So maybe Rudy is the key adviser. Maybe he tells the president this is somebody who’s disloyal to you, and the president tells Pompeo, get rid of her. It could have been that way, too.

michael barbaro

So all we know is that the president removes her from this job.

sharon lafraniere

Right. And we know that the State Department said that they were under pressure from the president to remove her for more than a year earlier.

michael barbaro

And what happens after she’s removed from this job?

sharon lafraniere

So about two months after she’s removed from the job, the president and Zelensky, the new Ukrainian president, have this now-famous phone call July 25, and she comes up —

michael barbaro

Yovanovitch.

sharon lafraniere

— in the phone call, yes. And the president says, “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news, and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news, so I just wanted to let you know that.” And then Zelensky agrees with Trump and says, “It was great that you were the first one who told me she was a bad ambassador, because I agree with you 100 percent.” And then President Trump says, “Well, she’s going to go through some things,” which sounds quite ominous.

michael barbaro

So whether the fact that the president got rid of the ambassador to Ukraine before turning up the pressure on Ukraine is kind of an open question. We don’t know yet.

sharon lafraniere

It is an open question.

michael barbaro

But It happened two months before this pivotal phone call.

sharon lafraniere

Right, which makes you wonder, was somebody trying to get her out of the way? We just don’t know.

michael barbaro

Right.

sharon lafraniere

She doesn’t know, I don’t think.

michael barbaro

So that Zelensky-Trump telephone call, of course, has led to the impeachment inquiry. Where has Yovanovitch fit in to the inquiry?

sharon lafraniere

So she’s going to be at the top of the witness list, right? But the question is, she is still a career official within the State Department.

michael barbaro

Because she’s fired from her job, but not from the department.

sharon lafraniere

Right. So she’s just lying low, and then her name shows up on the witness list. And the House impeachment investigators really want to get her in there and find out what happened. But the White House comes out with this letter saying, we’re not cooperating, the administration is not cooperating. So we’re all wondering is she going to show up, or she’s not going to show up?

michael barbaro

Does that apply to her?

sharon lafraniere

Yeah, no, it definitely applies to her. If the administration is not cooperating, she shouldn’t be cooperating, right? So most of us, I think, are figuring she’s not going to show up. She’s been told not to show up. And then we learn, you know, not too many hours before her testimony that she is showing up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

speaker Are you represented by State Department counsel, or are you —

sharon lafraniere

She’s showing up. And she walks through the entrance rather firmly flanked by her lawyer, and she disappears into the secure chambers where the House Intelligence Committee investigators begin to question her, and she doesn’t come out until dark. She testified for nearly nine hours in defiance of the White House directive.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. And what do we know about what she says?

sharon lafraniere

We got her opening statement, and it was, I thought, extremely dramatic. I was particularly struck by this one sentence that she wrote, which was, “Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was, nevertheless, incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.” All these things that have been swirling around about me are completely false. The notion I ever said, ignore President Trump’s orders because he’s going to be impeached anyway — I never said such a thing to my embassy colleagues or to anyone else. And then she gets to Giuliani, who she says she thinks she’s met maybe three times. O.K., “I do not know Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me.” But individuals, people named as his associates, may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were being stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine. In other words, maybe Giuliani’s friends thought that I was standing in the way of them putting money in their pocket. Maybe that’s what it is about. And she says more broadly that the U.S. foreign policy is going to be in a really bad state if we allow private interests to “circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good.” So she’s making a very, very important and broad point about this, is that this is not just about me. It’s chaos in the diplomatic scene. You have an ambassador who — the State Department doesn’t have her back. And she’s being discredited by the president’s own personal lawyer and then, later, by the president himself, in this phone call with the Ukrainian president. And that’s not just a, you know, cautionary tale about her. That’s a tale for a lot of diplomats who put themselves in harm’s way to serve the nation, as she says. So she doesn’t mention Mike Pompeo by name, but it’s clear that she feels that the State Department didn’t stand up for her and should have. She’s raising serious issues there, but they’re not really political issues, they’re issues of good governance and good administration.

michael barbaro

But to many people listening, her removal from this position as ambassador is providing a lot of ammunition to what has become a pretty political matter, which is the impeachment inquiry.

sharon lafraniere

Right. So the question about how did she lose her job? Why did she lose her job? Who drove her out? This is really central to the inquiry. And even if she didn’t provide the answers because maybe she doesn’t really know, other people are going to be asked about it. And beyond the issue of what she does know or doesn’t know, did say or didn’t say, just the fact that she showed up alone is significant, really remarkable.

michael barbaro

And testified.

sharon lafraniere

And testified. Are more people like her going to follow suit? Are they going to say, you know, we don’t care what the White House says, we’re making our own decision? And one example of that is Gordon Sondland, who is the U.S. ambassador for the European Union. First, he was going to testify. Then the White House, the State Department directed him not to testify, so he was taken off the schedule. And now he’s back on the schedule because he wants to testify for his own reasons, which are probably that he doesn’t want to be painted as the bad guy in this. So he’s worried about his own reputation.

michael barbaro

I’m curious what’s happened to all of the people who worked so hard to discredit Yovanovitch and ended up getting her removed from this job. What has happened to them?

archived recording Parnas and Fruman were arrested around 6:00 p.m. last night at Dulles Airport as they were about to board an international flight with one-way tickets.

The Times reports that in closed-door testimony on Monday, President Trump’s former top adviser on Russia, Fiona Hill, testified that she strongly objected to the removal of Marie Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine, but that her advice was ignored. Hill recounted that Rudy Giuliani’s conduct was so alarming that national security adviser John Bolton told her to alert White House lawyers about it, and that Bolton described Giuliani as, quote, “a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up.” Despite objections from the White House, the leaders of the impeachment inquiry are scheduled to hear from several more State Department officials over the coming days, including the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, and the ambassador to the European Union, who became deeply involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Trump’s rivals. We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

michael barbaro O.K., Eric Schmitt, can I just ask you about what happened in Syria on Monday? eric schmitt So three main things happened in Syria on Monday. The first is the Turkish offensive continued, continued deeper into Syrian territory. The second thing that happened was that the Syrian Kurds, who’d been allied to the Americans, they’d cut a deal with a new partner: President Assad, the Syrian government. And so Syrian government troops started moving into the territory that the Kurds used to hold. In response to all this — archived recording (steven mnuchin) The president announced that there would be sanctions forthcoming if Turkey moved forward with these actions. eric schmitt The United States finally acts, and that the president announces there’ll be economic sanctions against Turkey for what it’s done. archived recording (steven mnuchin) So effective immediately, we have sanctioned three of the ministers — the minister of defense, the minister of interior, and the minister of energy. eric schmitt But American officials I talked to today, particularly military officers who have served over in northeastern Syria, said it’s too little, too late. The sanctions, at this point, doesn’t matter. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of people will be displaced. ISIS fighters are breaking out of jails left and right. And all this has happened just a little over in the last week. archived recording (mike pence) President Trump made it very clear that the United States is going to continue to take actions against Turkey’s economy until they bring the violence to an end. We want an immediate cease fire, and we want to begin negotiations between Turkey and Syrian defense forces. We have great concerns about civilian populations.

The associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Furman, were charged with funneling illegal contributions to a congressman whose help they had sought in removing Ms. Yovanovitch.

Here’s a guide to the Ukraine saga’s growing cast of characters.

A former ambassador to Ukraine speaks

Ms. Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators on Friday that a top State Department official had told her that Mr. Trump had pushed for her removal for months even though her employer, the State Department, believed she had “done nothing wrong.”

She dismissed as “fictitious” accusations that she had been disloyal to Mr. Trump, which she said had been circulated by allies of Mr. Giuliani.

Ms. Yovanovitch, testifying in defiance of State Department orders and at risk of losing her job, delivered a scathing indictment of how the Trump administration conducts foreign policy, warning that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats’ judgment and could undermine the nation’s interests.

Ms. Yovanovitch said of her time in Ukraine: “Our efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen. Sadly, someone was listening, and our nation is the worse off for that.”"

In a brief news conference here Sunday in which he repeatedly pounded the podium, Mr. Biden stressed that the decision to leave the Chinese company’s board had been his son’s alone and suggested he learned of the statement from Hunter Biden’s lawyers. He also took what seemed to be veiled swipes at some of Mr. Trump’s children, who have had their own overseas business dealings.

“The statement my son put out today, which I saw when he put it out — I was told it was going to be put out, I did not consult with him about what’s being put out — in fact represents the kind of man of integrity he is,” Mr. Biden said. “ And I can tell you now, if I am your president, next president, I’m going to build on the squeaky-clean transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House, and no one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operation whatsoever. Period, end of story.”

Minutes later, he appeared to jab more sharply at members of the Trump family, a message that Mr. Biden, a Senate traditionalist who reveres beltway customs and civility, does not typically emphasize.

“No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they’re a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,” he said."

His geopolitical idols trend toward the autocratic — Kim Jong-un, Rodrigo Duterte, Mohammed bin Salman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Vladimir Putin. He suffers delusions of grandeur, proclaiming himself “the Chosen One” and having “great and unmatched wisdom.” He accuses those who challenge him of treason, and he regularly wipes his feet on the constitutional principle of checks and balances.

Witness the over-the-top letter his White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, sent House Democrats this week, the gist of which was: Your impeachment investigation is illegitimate, and we will not participate. As if this were the president’s prerogative. Legal experts mostly dismissed the letter as a political stunt. Gregg Nunziata, a former counsel to Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, called it “bananas.” Walter Shaub, who resigned as head of the Office of Government Ethics in 2017 over the administration’s glaring lack of ethics, said that it “mistakes Trump for a king.”

Fortunately, Mr. Trump’s dreams of dominance tend to bump up against the hard realities of incompetence — his and that of his cronies. It has long been apparent that the president has a peculiar eye for talent. The repercussions of this were on display this week as the Ukraine scandal at the heart of the impeachment inquiry continued to unspool, spotlighting a fresh batch of colorful characters and questionable behavior.

In one of the more bizarre impeachment twists to date, two businessmen involved in the president’s efforts to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden were arrested on campaign finance violation charges as they were trying to leave the country on Wednesday. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are Soviet-born naturalized Americans who have been working closely with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, to investigate Mr. Biden, one of the president’s chief political rivals, and his son Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine. The men were also helping search for evidence to support a (debunked) conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine for the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee."

Mr. Sanders acknowledged in an NBC interview that he had received the heart attack diagnosis last Tuesday night, three days before his campaign disclosed it.

As our colleagues Sydney Ember and Jonathan Martin reported, Mr. Sanders’s wife, Jane, his most trusted adviser, has helped shape the campaign’s response.

Republicans are attacking Warren

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became “visibly pregnant” at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her.

This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting — and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread.

The candidates talked L.G.B.T.Q. rights

CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder.

You can read about the forum here.

Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president."

Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.

And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.

That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.

Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”

Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.

But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.

The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person."

“So now they are after the legendary ‘crime buster’ and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani,” Mr. Trump wrote. “He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer.

Amid it all, Mr. Trump left again for the campaign trail, which he has long employed as a useful conduit for his most provocative language, particularly when he feels the confines of Washington closing in.

Upon landing, he announced the departure of Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security who had publicly expressed frustration with the job in recent weeks. Once the president took the stage in this southwestern corner of the state, he defended himself against those pursuing impeachment, singling out Ms. Pelosi and Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

Mr. Schiff’s decision during a committee hearing to liken the president’s remarks in the July 25 call to a mobster issuing a veiled threat drew the president’s ire on Friday, as it had for weeks.

“He made it up: It was fiction,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t know, congressman, are you immune from something like that? That should be a crime.”

Throughout the rally, Mr. Trump seemed to abruptly switch emotional channels. He toggled between lashing out at Democrats to acting out an imagined back-and-forth between two former F.B.I. officials, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, in order to mock them for exchanging unflattering text messages about Mr. Trump during his candidacy. He also paused at one point to interview Little League ballplayers about their pitching speeds.

Eventually, he circled back to his original purpose for the visit: testing his political influence over local races ahead of Saturday’s primary election, largely following the same attack-style playbook he deployed last month in a close North Carolina race."

For the third consecutive night, Mr. Trump delivered a version of his combative response to the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry declared last month by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, this time during an official presidential speech at the Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of social conservatives in Washington.

“I think she hates our country,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Pelosi. “If she didn’t hate our country, she wouldn’t be doing this to our country. It’s a fraud.” After months of restraint, Ms. Pelosi last month charged Mr. Trump with betraying the nation’s security by seeking to enlist a foreign government to damage a political rival for his own gain.

Mr. Trump’s remarks came after two nights of raucous campaign rallies, one in the progressive city of Minneapolis, and another in the deep-red district of Lake Charles, La.

Mr. Giuliani said that federal prosecutors had no grounds to charge him with foreign lobbying disclosure violations because he said he was acting on behalf of Mr. Trump, not the Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, when he collected the information on Ms. Yovanovitch and the others and relayed it to the American government and the news media.

“Look, you can try to contort anything into anything, but if they have any degree of objectivity or fairness, it would be kind of ridiculous to say I was doing it on Lutsenko’s behalf when I was representing the president of the United States,” Mr. Giuliani said. Mr. Lutsenko had chafed at Ms. Yovanovitch’s anticorruption efforts and wanted her recalled from Kiev.

Mr. Giuliani also said he was unaware of any investigation into him, and he defended the pressure campaign on Ukrainians, which he led, as legal and above board.

For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada — the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate.

But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden , some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates.

At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals — supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates’ appeal.

These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Julián Castro — candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls.

On Sunday Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CBS that his panel might not ultimately hear testimony from the whistleblower, given concerns about his safety amid sharp attacks from Mr. Trump and his allies.

“It may not be necessary to take steps that might reveal the whistleblower’s identity to do that,” Mr. Schiff said. “And we’re going to make sure we protect that whistleblower.”

In one text exchange released by congressional Democrats last week between Mr. Sondland and William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Kyiv, Mr. Taylor expressed concern that there appeared to be a link between a delay in sending almost $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine by the administration and Mr. Trump’s political interests.

Mr. Taylor texted Mr. Sondland in September: “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.”

Mr. Sondland wrote back five hours later: “The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo’s of any kind.” He added: “I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.”

Before sending that text message, Mr. Sondland spoke to the president for about five minutes by phone to ask whether there was any link between the aid and Ukraine’s agreement to launch investigations, according to the person familiar with the matter. Mr. Trump “assured him that the aid cutoff was not tied in the manner Taylor suggested,” the person said.

During that call, the president seemed to Mr. Sondland preoccupied and unhappy about a matter unrelated to Ukraine, the person said.

Mr. Trump and his allies have pointed to the exchange between the two diplomats as evidence that there was never any political motive in delaying the aid package.

Mr. Sondland’s congressional testimony won’t offer any independent corroborating facts for the assertions of Mr. Trump and his allies, the person said.

The ambassador wasn’t involved in putting a hold on the aid and therefore wasn’t aware if the president was telling the truth or not, the person said. Mr. Trump ordered the aid put on hold by the White House. After complaints from lawmakers, it was released last month.

The person suggested that Mr. Sondland accepted the president’s statement as true when he heard it or wouldn’t have passed it on to Mr. Taylor.

Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have pushed to have the Ukrainian government reopen an investigation into Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, who sat on the board of an energy company called Burisma Group while the then-vice president was leading an international anticorruption effort in Ukraine.

Mr. Trump raised the issue in a call with the new Ukrainian president July 25, asking him to “look into” Mr. Biden and his son, according to a rough transcript released by the White House last month. In that call, Mr. Trump didn’t explicitly make the aid contingent on Ukrainian cooperation on that and another investigation, according to the rough transcript, though he did remind his counterpart: “We do a lot for Ukraine.”

Mr. Sondland is expected to face several hours of questioning before congressional committees on his tenure as ambassador—including one incident where he met with Mr. Giuliani on the possibility of reopening a Burisma investigation.

Mr. Sondland and other U.S. diplomats learned in August that Ukraine was drafting a statement saying it would reopen investigations into possible election interference and other matters, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Mr. Giuliani pressed Mr. Sondland and another diplomat to make sure that it named Burisma Group.

The statement was never issued over concerns in Ukraine about being perceived as wading into U.S. electoral politics, among other matters, the Journal has previously reported. Mr. Biden is a Democratic 2020 presidential hopeful.

Mr. Sondland is expected to tell House lawmakers that he understood that Ukraine issuing the statement was a condition for a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelensky, the person familiar with his testimony said. “In that sense, it’s a quid pro quo, although all diplomacy is quid pro quo in that sense,” the person said. Mr. Sondland didn’t view that arrangement as troubling because it was understood that combating corruption in Ukraine was a key element of U.S. foreign policy toward the country, the person said.

Nominated as ambassador in May 2018, Mr. Sondland is a former hotel executive and major donor to President Trump with no prior diplomatic experience. In February, weeks after Russia seized a Ukrainian navy ship, he unofficially added Ukraine—which isn’t an EU member—to his portfolio.

Over the next seven months, Mr. Sondland traveled to Ukraine or met with its top leaders repeatedly, presenting himself as a direct line to the White House, according to Ukrainian officials and documents released in the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Sondland’s role continued to grow after Mr. Trump in May ordered the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine after Mr. Giuliani raised concerns she was undermining Mr. Giuliani’s efforts there.

That ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, told Congress on Friday she was pushed out by what she called a “concerted campaign” led by Mr. Giuliani and other allies of Mr. Trump.

Mr. Giuliani couldn’t be reached for immediate comment.

As The New York Times reported, after Trump recalled the U.S. ambassador, Lutsenko gloated to the head of AntAC that he had “eliminated your roof,” using Russian mafia slang for guardian.

“We’ve been exporting our corruption to them, rather than trying to export good governance,” said Fukuyama.

When he said that, Fukuyama may not have known how right he was. A few hours after I met Leshchenko, news broke that two Ukrainian-born clients of Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, had been arrested on charges of campaign finance crimes as they were preparing to leave the United States with one-way tickets.

According to an indictment, the two “sought to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.” (In one of those preposterously on-the-nose details that make the Trump era feel like a computer simulation on the fritz, Parnas had a company called Fraud Guarantee.)

As soon as news of the indictment broke, I messaged Leshchenko, who guessed that the unnamed Ukrainian official was Lutsenko. It was a natural assumption; it had already been reported that Parnas and Fruman connected Giuliani with Lutsenko, who had been feeding Trump’s lawyer conspiracy theories about the journalist, the former American ambassador and Joe Biden.

Sure enough, on Saturday NBC News reported that Lutsenko was the official in the indictment. Yovanovitch might have been referring to Lutsenko when she said, in her Friday congressional testimony, that “individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”

Thanks to Giuliani’s escapades, the domestic grudges of a crooked Ukrainian prosecutor have blossomed into a scandal that’s likely to lead to the impeachment of an American president. Federal prosecutors are now investigating whether Giuliani himself broke the law."

Porter played an M.C. of sorts who introduced the candidates with his typical energy.

The first to take the stage was Chris Redd, who portrayed Senator Cory Booker, the Democrat from New Jersey, who told the audience, “My girlfriend was in ‘Rent’ so yeah, I get it,” a reference to Booker’s significant other, the actress Rosario Dawson. The forum went quickly, with each candidate getting a moment or two — the rare merging of speed dating, comedy and politics. The next to get lampooned was Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind. Buttigieg was again played by Colin Jost, who rarely appears in sketches. In response to an audience member who asked about being “gay in the right way,” Jost said, “There’s no wrong way to be gay. Unless you’re Ellen this week.” This reference was to the daytime television host, Ellen DeGeneres, who recently received flak after being spotted at a football game with the former president George W. Bush."

And yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I’m looking at you.”

For Facebook, the situation is tricky. The social media company has struggled in recent years with what to allow and disallow on its site, especially after revelations that Russian operatives used the platform during the 2016 presidential election to post disinformation to inflame the American electorate. Facebook has moved to clamp down on false content. Yet when the company removes or buries messages, ads, photos and videos, it is often called out for bias and censorship. Facebook has faced particular wrath from conservatives, who have said the social network intentionally suppresses what they say.

“Facebook believes political speech should be protected,” a spokesman for Facebook said on Saturday. “If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.”

Truth in social media advertising is likely to become a bigger issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to speak about Facebook’s political speech policies this coming week at Georgetown University.

Presidential candidates have been spending huge sums on ads on Facebook and other social media platforms to reach voters. Some campaigns have focused on advertising specifically on Facebook given its sheer size — it has more than 2.2 billion users worldwide — and the ability to spread ads and content cheaply and quickly across the platform."

Mueller III.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are now investigating whether Mr. Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine may have run afoul of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, The New York Times reported on Friday.

Mr. Giuliani has defended his work in Ukraine and said it did not require him to register under FARA.

Mr. Trump was not enamored with the negative publicity around Mr. Giuliani, people close to the president said, but he remains loyal because of his lawyer’s willingness to aggressively defend him during the special counsel’s inquiry.

It is not clear what was discussed at the lunch.

The lunch is unlikely to end speculation over whether the president will ultimately consider Mr. Giuliani a liability. Another of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, met privately with the president in Florida in March 2018, a month before the F.B.I. searched his home, hotel room and office. Mr. Trump publicly embraced Mr. Cohen, until it became clear he might speak against the president.

A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If his family intends to shun foreign business in the event that he becomes president — as Hunter Biden said he would on Sunday — voters may wonder why they didn’t do it far sooner, when Mr. Biden was conducting foreign diplomacy as vice president.

Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference — to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors a nd voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term.

“I’m a little worried about how Joe’s going to do if he were to get on a debate stage with the president, a little worried he’d be able to get him rattled,” said Tom Courtney, t he co-chairman of the Des Moines County Democrats in Iowa, a state where the Biden campaign has made substantial investments. “I would like to see him quit getting bogged down in little things.

In a brief news conference here Sunday in which he repeatedly pounded the podium, Mr. Biden stressed that the decision to leave the Chinese company’s board had been his son’s alone and suggested he learned of the statement from Hunter Biden’s lawyers. He also took what seemed to be veiled swipes at some of Mr. Trump’s children, who have had their own overseas business dealings.

“The statement my son put out today, which I saw when he put it out — I was told it was going to be put out, I did not consult with him about what’s being put out — in fact represents the kind of man of integrity he is,” Mr. Biden said. “ And I can tell you now, if I am your president, next president, I’m going to build on the squeaky-clean transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House, and no one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operation whatsoever. Period, end of story.”

Minutes later, he appeared to jab more sharply at members of the Trump family, a message that Mr. Biden, a Senate traditionalist who reveres beltway customs and civility, does not typically emphasize.

“No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they’re a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,” he said."

The United States won’t get Iran to the table without some economic relief — either directly or through the European Union, as President Emmanuel Macron of France has suggested. The United States will also need to abandon as a precondition for progress the 12 demands that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid out publicly last year. This hard-bitten and resourceful Iranian regime is not going to issue that kind of declaration of surrender.

The Iranians will have to get more realistic, too. It is simply impractical to think that the United States will provide significant sanctions relief without assurances that Iran will immediately begin negotiations on a follow-on agreement that at least extends the timelines of the deal and addresses issues of verification and intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif recently signaled some openness to negotiation of additional terms. While we should have no illusions about how difficult that would be, we should certainly test the proposition. The Iranians have known since the secret talks that we saw this as an iterative process, like other arms control processes, in which one agreement became a foundation stone for further negotiations. The nuclear deal agreed to in 2015 was meant to be the beginning, not the end, of diplomacy with Iran.

Both sides should also seek to reduce tensions more broadly. It is long past time to secure the release of Americans detained, deeply unfairly, in Iran. It is time to stop threats to vital shipping lanes, and stop making Iraq a battleground for American-Iranian competition. We should make an opportunity of the crisis in the gulf and push hard to end the war in Yemen. That conflict is not only a humanitarian tragedy of epic proportion but also a strategic calamity for our gulf partners and a stain on American foreign policy. Afghanistan is another issue to discuss directly, given Iran’s stake in stability there, and Tehran’s ability to disrupt it.

If you asked us to propose a path for diplomacy with Iran, we’d suggest not starting from where we are today.

But we are where we are, and we know where we’re headed, especially given the surplus of mutual enablers in both Tehran and Washington. We have our last, best chance for diplomacy before us. We should seize it.

For the third consecutive night, Mr. Trump delivered a version of his combative response to the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry declared last month by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, this time during an official presidential speech at the Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of social conservatives in Washington.

“I think she hates our country,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Pelosi. “If she didn’t hate our country, she wouldn’t be doing this to our country.

Ms. Warren’s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend.

It’s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans.

Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past?

Whither Mayor Pete?

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls.

So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by “West Wing”-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark.

Does anyone else break out of the pack?

For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada — the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate.

But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden , some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates.

At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals — supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates’ appeal.

These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Julián Castro — candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls.

“My daughter is marrying an Asian man and diversity has become very important to me,” said Julie Neff, a 57-year-old Iowa Democrat who attended the Harris rally. Ms. Neff, who is white, said she was embarrassed that she started thinking about race and discrimination only later in life."

ISIS has already claimed responsibility for at least two attacks since the start of the invasion.

Russia’s Syria role: Our video investigation proves that the Russian Air Force repeatedly bombed hospitals in rebel-held areas of Syria to crush remaining resistance to the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad.

Meanwhile, President Trump and his family have used the office of the president as an A.T.M., beyond his numerous moral and ethical failings.

But why would a Ukrainian gas company give Hunter Biden millions of dollars for a board seat in an industry he knew nothing about if they weren’t trying to curry favor with his father, the vice president? This is anthropology 101 — generalized reciprocity, where a gift of real value is made, with an expected return gift of uncertain or unspecified value at an undetermined time in the future. That we so easily accept this kind of payola to politicians is part of the reason it’s near-impossible to hold Mr. Trump accountable.

Anyway, fair or not, the Biden smear is certainly portrayed as truth on Fox News’s talk shows. Most of us around here seldom see that network’s news programs, which have been more evenhanded in their recent coverage of the president. When we get up in the morning to go to work, it’s “Fox & Friends” on the air. In the evening, by the time we are done wrangling kids and supper, it’s Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity.

And the local culture goes much deeper than Fox News, which doesn’t create the reality of conservatives here so much as reinforce it. To my devout conservative neighbors, liberals are tearing America apart. Mr. Trump is the only conservative with the courage enough to stand up to their way.

They see the hand of God in this, and many truly believe he is the “chosen one.” To them, Democrats are amoral and spiritually empty. Where evangelical Republicans worship God and see Jesus as the only path to him, Democrats have banned Jesus from the public sphere at great cost to society and the potential salvation of millions.

To rural white conservatives, their culture is being rubbed out right before their eyes. Compared with that, Mr. Trump’s sins — Ukraine and all — are trivial, while the Democrats are unrepentant and persist in their wrongdoing.

So, yes, the dismal rural economy, brought on directly by the president’s actions, may prompt independents and some Republicans to vote for a Democrat, because they will see it in their economic interests to do so."

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

An ad with Ms. Gabbard describing her foreign policy while standing in front of an American flag was disproportionately shown to men. Source: Facebook

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

The next to get lampooned was Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind. Buttigieg was again played by Colin Jost, who rarely appears in sketches. In response to an audience member who asked about being “gay in the right way,” Jost said, “There’s no wrong way to be gay. Unless you’re Ellen this week.” This reference was to the daytime television host, Ellen DeGeneres, who recently received flak after being spotted at a football game with the former president George W.

So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

Many Democratic strategists and officials have warned that the scrutiny on the Biden family has become a significant distraction for the former vice president, and poses perhaps the greatest threat yet to a candidacy that until recent weeks was well ahead in the polls. That makes it all the more urgent for Mr. Biden to land the kind of consistently fluent, forceful debate performance that has so far eluded him at a moment when Senator Elizabeth Warren has now surpassed him in some polls, Democratic operatives and activists said.

“I’m never a distraction to my dad, but as it relates to actually going and being onstage with him — this is not a family business,” Hunter Biden said Tuesday in the ABC interview, which aired on “Good Morning America’’ and was also excerpted online by the network. “Everybody kind of thinks that somehow, whether it’s a compliment that we’re like the Kennedys or whether it’s a, you know, backhanded compliment like you’re the Trumps, my dad has a, a job, but that does not mean that I have had any plans to go do rallies and, you know and, you know, talk about Donald Trump’s kids and I never will, you know, that’s not what Bidens do.”

At a news conference on Sunday, however, his father did appear to take some oblique swipes at the ethical practices of members of the Trump family, some of whom who have conducted their own overseas business dealings.

“Donald Prince Humperdinck, um, Trump, Jr., is not somebody I really care about,” he said, an apparent reference to a character in the movie “The Princess Bride.”

In the interview, Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father.

Seven in 10 Democratic voters support mandatory buybacks, according to an August Quinnipiac poll, although less than half of all voters do.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs. Among Democrats, it’s a particularly winning concept; 86 percent of Democrats nationwide back the Green New Deal, the poll found."

It was Mr. Buttigieg’s exchange with Ms. Warren over “Medicare for all” that was most memorable, pressing her as she declined to say, yet again, whether her plan would require a middle-class tax increase. (She says her plan would curb middle-class “costs.”)

“A yes-or-no question that did not get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg said, adding, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.” He rattled off how her plan would “obliterate” the private health insurance of 150 million Americans while pitching his “Medicare for all who want it” alternative.

Mr. Buttigieg’s rebuke of Mr. O’Rourke — “I don’t need lessons from you on courage” — may lend itself more to a viral moment. But the bigger leap was to be seen as a foil to Ms. Warren.

The United States won’t get Iran to the table without some economic relief — either directly or through the European Union, as President Emmanuel Macron of France has suggested. The United States will also need to abandon as a precondition for progress the 12 demands that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid out publicly last year. This hard-bitten and resourceful Iranian regime is not going to issue that kind of declaration of surrender.

The Iranians will have to get more realistic, too. It is simply impractical to think that the United States will provide significant sanctions relief without assurances that Iran will immediately begin negotiations on a follow-on agreement that at least extends the timelines of the deal and addresses issues of verification and intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif recently signaled some openness to negotiation of additional terms. While we should have no illusions about how difficult that would be, we should certainly test the proposition. The Iranians have known since the secret talks that we saw this as an iterative process, like other arms control processes, in which one agreement became a foundation stone for further negotiations. The nuclear deal agreed to in 2015 was meant to be the beginning, not the end, of diplomacy with Iran.

Both sides should also seek to reduce tensions more broadly. It is long past time to secure the release of Americans detained, deeply unfairly, in Iran. It is time to stop threats to vital shipping lanes, and stop making Iraq a battleground for American-Iranian competition. We should make an opportunity of the crisis in the gulf and push hard to end the war in Yemen. That conflict is not only a humanitarian tragedy of epic proportion but also a strategic calamity for our gulf partners and a stain on American foreign policy. Afghanistan is another issue to discuss directly, given Iran’s stake in stability there, and Tehran’s ability to disrupt it.

If you asked us to propose a path for diplomacy with Iran, we’d suggest not starting from where we are today.

But we are where we are, and we know where we’re headed, especially given the surplus of mutual enablers in both Tehran and Washington. We have our last, best chance for diplomacy before us. We should seize it.

Mr. Kent had raised concerns to colleagues early this year about pressure being directed at Ukraine by President Trump and Rudy Giuliani to pursue investigations into Mr. Trump’s political rivals.

Mr. Kent’s testimony followed a pattern that has emerged among recent witnesses. The State Department directed Mr. Kent not to appear and sought to limit his testimony, according to officials familiar with the investigation. But the House Intelligence Committee issued a last-minute subpoena, and he complied.

Tuesday was the document deadline for Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Giuliani, the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Pence and the O.M.B. rejected the requests. A lawyer for Mr. Giuliani sent a letter to House officials saying that Mr. Giuliani would not comply with the subpoena he was issued.

How this impeachment is different

Investigators this week are calling in witnesses who aren’t typically part of the Washington news cycle: a former Russia specialist on the National Security Council, the ambassador to the European Union, a deputy assistant secretary of defense.

The range of voices puts this impeachment investigation in new historical territory, according to Philip Bobbitt, a professor at Columbia Law School and a co-author with Charles Black of “Impeachment: A Handbook.”

The Clinton impeachment had little to do with governance, Mr. Bobbit told me.

“It had nothing to do with foreign policy or defense policy,” he said. “And in Nixon’s case, there were maybe a couple of dozen people involved.”

The inquiry so far has leaned on witness depositions in addition to traditional evidentiary material like transcripts, which were a mainstay for investigators organizing the case against President Richard Nixon."
263,Nicholas Fandos and Kenneth P.

Ukraine Expert",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/impeachment-george-kent-state.html,"“Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine, who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy and promoting the rule of law in Ukraine,” Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said of Mr. Kent, after departing from the room where he was being deposed.

“And that was wrong,” Mr. Connolly said. “He used that word, ‘wrong.’”

After the May 23 meeting called by Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Kent told investigators, he and others whose portfolios included Ukraine were edged out by Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union; Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine; and Rick Perry, the energy secretary, who “declared themselves the three people now responsible for Ukraine policy,” Mr. Connolly said.

The meeting occurred on the same day that Mr. Sondland, Mr. Volker and Mr. Perry urged Mr. Trump in an Oval Office briefing to support and arrange a White House meeting for the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, from whose inauguration they had just returned. It was unclear if the meeting described by Mr. Kent was the same one or another session.

Mr. Trump replied skeptically, telling the group that Ukrainian politicians are “all corrupt.” In the weeks after that, Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker began working with Mr. Giuliani to urge Mr. Zelensky to commit to the investigations sought by Mr. Trump.

Mr. Kent said he was told at another point to “lay low” on Ukraine matters.

The accounts are trickling out even as the White House seeks to block even more information from surfacing in the impeachment inquiry. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday defied a request by investigators for documents related to the inquiry, and the Defense Department, the Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Giuliani all gave notice that they would defy subpoenas to turn over material. All of them cited the lack of a House vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry as grounds for stonewalling."

Ms. Warren’s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend.

It’s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans.

Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past?

Whither Mayor Pete?

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls.

So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by “West Wing”-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark.

Does anyone else break out of the pack?

Four candidates on the stage haven’t qualified for the next debate in November: the former housing secretary Julián Castro, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mr. O’Rourke. Tuesday night is a now-or-never moment for them."

Obama, Levingston writes, was “a young, cerebral African-American who sweated over the precision of his words”; Biden was “an older chummy white guy given to impulsively speaking his mind.” Obama considered Biden a Washington blowhard; listening to one of Biden’s long-winded speeches during a Senate hearing, he wrote a note to an aide: “Shoot. Me. Now.” Biden, for his part, believed Obama to be an impudent tyro. But when Obama needed to choose a running mate, Biden — with his decades of Senate experience and his popularity among white, working-class voters in Rust Belt states — checked the right boxes. During the campaign and then in the White House, their relationship developed and deepened, to the point that, in 2014, when Biden considered taking out a second mortgage to help pay for his son Beau’s brain cancer treatments, Obama told him not to and that, if necessary, he would give Biden the money himself. “Barack and Joe filled in the spaces that were missing in the other man and created something bigger than their separate parts,” Levingston writes. They were “a perfectly matched odd couple.”

Levingston spends much of “Barack and Joe” dwelling on the public-facing aspect of — and public response to — their “bromance.” He quotes from both men’s Twitter and Instagram accounts; late-night hosts, cable news gasbags and internet meme-makers are all frequently cited. And he attempts to tease out why those who were “observing the president and vice president from a distance” were so invested in Obama and Biden’s relationship. Part of it, Levingston theorizes, was that “America had a weakness for buddy teams. Felix and Oscar. Bert and Ernie. Buzz and Woody.” More interestingly, he argues that Obama and Biden’s partnership, “just by its existence and daily workings … served as a badge of racial harmony.”

What “Barack and Joe” fails to do is shed much new light on the private nature of the two men’s relationship. The nonfiction book editor of The Washington Post, Levingston has combed through the memoirs of Obama administration officials, as well as a number of other journalists’ books, for anecdotes and insights about events that transpired behind the scenes, but he appears to have done little original reporting of his own, interviewing only a handful of people who observed the relationship up close. (Noting that Obama and Biden both declined to be interviewed for his book, Levingston writes, “It has seemed curious to me that, despite their busy schedules, Barack and Joe could not find time to discuss their complicated but largely felicitous relationship.”)

As a result, “Barack and Joe” frequently reads like a rehash of episodes and events that are already well known, with seemingly minor matters being afforded undue significance if only because they’ve previously been well documented. Does the world in 2019, for instance, really need 20 pages on the “Beer Summit” — the 2009 pseudo-event in which Biden and Obama hoisted beers in the Rose Garden with the black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates and the white Cambridge police officer who mistakenly arrested him? Even worse, “Barack and Joe” is written in a cloying style — “Barack and Joe, no longer opponents, were now able to move into a new phase with each other,” or “Through straight talk over lunch, Barack and Joe resolved their spat” — that seems better suited to a children’s book than a sophisticated political account.

That’s a shame, because with Biden now casting his third presidential run as an attempt to create a third Obama term, it’s never been more important to understand the true and substantive nature of the two men’s political partnership. For all the affectionate lunch outings and bro-hugs that lit up the internet, Obama nonetheless dissuaded Biden from running for president in 2016, instead putting his chips on Hillary Clinton. And in the 2020 race, Obama hasn’t endorsed Biden — or anyone else — in the Democratic primaries. The two men’s friendship may have “moved the nation” as no White House pairing ever had, as Levingston writes. But was it — and should it be — enough to move one of them back into the White House?"

Bret: Wavering. A few of my arguments against impeachment no longer look as good to me now as they did two weeks ago. Public sentiment in favor of the inquiry is growing, even among a few Republicans, which makes the impeachment process itself less likely to be a purely partisan process. The evidence of presidential malfeasance is also growing. That’s an argument to let the process continue, see what we learn and keep an open mind.

Gail: I can definitely imagine Buttigieg being the Democratic nominee down the road — in another four or eight or 12 years.

This is anthropology 101 — generalized reciprocity, where a gift of real value is made, with an expected return gift of uncertain or unspecified value at an undetermined time in the future. That we so easily accept this kind of payola to politicians is part of the reason it’s near-impossible to hold Mr. Trump accountable.

Anyway, fair or not, the Biden smear is certainly portrayed as truth on Fox News’s talk shows. Most of us around here seldom see that network’s news programs, which have been more evenhanded in their recent coverage of the president. When we get up in the morning to go to work, it’s “Fox & Friends” on the air. In the evening, by the time we are done wrangling kids and supper, it’s Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity.

And the local culture goes much deeper than Fox News, which doesn’t create the reality of conservatives here so much as reinforce it. To my devout conservative neighbors, liberals are tearing America apart. Mr. Trump is the only conservative with the courage enough to stand up to their way.

They see the hand of God in this, and many truly believe he is the “chosen one.” To them, Democrats are amoral and spiritually empty. Where evangelical Republicans worship God and see Jesus as the only path to him, Democrats have banned Jesus from the public sphere at great cost to society and the potential salvation of millions.

To rural white conservatives, their culture is being rubbed out right before their eyes. Compared with that, Mr. Trump’s sins — Ukraine and all — are trivial, while the Democrats are unrepentant and persist in their wrongdoing.

So, yes, the dismal rural economy, brought on directly by the president’s actions, may prompt independents and some Republicans to vote for a Democrat, because they will see it in their economic interests to do so."

Voters Who Want to Like Them?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/opinion/democrats-debate-republicans.html,"The best example of how candidates botch their approach is on the issue of abortion. A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v. Wade, but a longstanding 80 percent of them support restrictions of some kind (according to 2019 Gallup polling), most notably in the third trimester (as of 2018 Gallup polling, 65 percent support restrictions in second trimester as well). Only Senator Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Gabbard have admitted to supporting third-trimester restrictions. The rest, including the current front-runners Senator Elizabeth Warren and the former vice president Joe Biden, have offered rare consideration for restrictions or conversation around why such large portions of the country support them.

Abortion and reproductive rights may not be a “deal breaker” vote for swing voters, as a recent Fox News poll revealed, but it is an issue that matters deeply to them, especially those who hold faith in high regard. More to the point, it’s curious that so many Democratic candidates hold a view consistent with so few voters. No one should swap genuine beliefs about abortion to appease polling numbers, but if these candidates represent the American people, they are statistically divergent from them in a dramatic way. This may mean a few of them are hiding their authentic beliefs about abortion for political safety — but that’s to their detriment.

The answer for candidates isn’t necessarily changing policy positions but offering room for conversation with those who support restrictions and respect for an alternative position that is rooted in genuine beliefs about the origins of life.

Even Mr. Biden, viewed as a moderate, has disappointed on the issue, reversing his long-held position on banning federal funds for abortion. This has damaged his “moderate” brand slightly. He has also given into relentless badgering from progressives, endorsing the Green New Deal and bowing to liberal sexual politics with his recent announcement that he would support men who identify as women being housed with females in prison.

All of this leftward marching, for Mr. Biden and others, moves candidates further from potential voters it’s necessary to win over. These folks may not vote for Mr. Trump (or vote at all), but Democrats stand to lose this opening with them for good. Now is the time to put formerly Republican voters on notice, as Ms. Gabbard has done with her distinctive approach.

They crave the anti-Trump, not a hypocritical Kamala Harris and her indefensible record on criminal justice. Ms. Harris describes herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” but infamously upheld multiple wrongful conviction cases and failed to support a ballot initiative that would reduce penalties for nonviolent crimes. These voters also have little interest in an opportunistic Mayor Pete Buttigieg: For years in Indiana politics, he worked “cordially” with Mike Pence, then the governor, but only since becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party has the mayor chosen to demean Mr. Pence’s religious beliefs.

Ms. Gabbard and Ms. Klobuchar — who also tends to focus on winnable, bipartisan issues like lowering the price of prescription drugs — appear to be the only two candidates to understand this opportunity for new votes."

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

An ad with Ms. Gabbard describing her foreign policy while standing in front of an American flag was disproportionately shown to men. Source: Facebook

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Mr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren’s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for “Medicare for all,” a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance.

Today: Last night in Ohio, for the first time in more than a decade, The New York Times co-hosted a presidential debate.

marc lacey So I’ve never done one of these debates before, but you two are pros.

michael barbaro

My colleague Mark Lacey, the National editor at The Times, moderated it with CNN’s Anderson Cooper —

anderson cooper I don’t actually get nervous a lot about things, because I’m sort of dead inside. But — and I’m a WASP so I always learned to push all my emotions deep down inside. But it’s definitely a heightened state on that stage. I mean, you —

michael barbaro

— and Erin Burnett.

erin burnett Each person wants to break through, right? I mean, this is their moment. And for some people, they want to get on the next stage, right? So they have to break through.

michael barbaro

It was also the first debate since Democrats have started pursuing an impeachment inquiry into the president — one that centers around his efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating the leading Democratic candidate onstage last night, Joe Biden. It’s Wednesday, October 16.

Why aren’t we talking to Maggie and Alex?

monika evstatieva

— so to speak —

michael barbaro

I’m confused.

monika evstatieva

Still hold it to your —

alexander burns

Hello?

alexandra leigh young

Are you guys there? Monica?

alexander burns

You’ve got Alex Burns.

monika evstatieva

Please say yes.

alexandra leigh young

Oh, Alex Burns!

alexander burns

Hi.

michael barbaro

Alex Burns. Hello.

alexander burns

Hello?

michael barbaro

Hey.

alexander burns

Hi.

michael barbaro

Alex, can you hear me?

maggie haberman

Hello?

michael barbaro

Maggie!

maggie haberman

Michael.

michael barbaro

Good morning.

maggie haberman

Right. Yes, it is.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Good morning.

maggie haberman

Right. Yes, it is.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

“Oh my,” Patti Solis Doyle, who served as Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager in 2008, remarked when the figures were first posted on Twitter.

Mr. Biden’s treasury now ranks fifth in the Democratic field, also behind Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had $10.5 million in the bank, though her $911,000 in unpaid bills — to her pollster, media buyer and lawyers, among others — meant that her functional cash on hand was closer to $9.6 million. (Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg reported no debts.)

The self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and reported spending $47 million , also has more financial resources than Mr. Biden heading toward the Iowa caucuses, which are less than four months away.

Mr. Biden’s team has steadfastly said that it has enough cash to run the campaign it wants, and recently announced plans to spend $6 million on digital and television ads in the coming months.

“The fundamental question about fund-raising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,” said Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden.

On Friday, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, scheduled a conference call with the campaign’s donors, presumably to reassure them about the path forward.

I know what the job is. I’ve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on Day 1 can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required, now more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on Day 1. That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before. I’ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I’ve been there, and I’ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.

BURNETT: Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?

BIDEN: Before the first vote.

BURNETT: Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?

WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people’s lives, things like child care and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight."

It Was the Worst of Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/democratic-debate-ohio.html,"She was referring to Tom Steyer, who was making his Democratic-debate debut.

Warren said that she had nothing against billionaires per se and wasn’t in the demonization business. She was in the justice business. And with her final remarks, she sought to underscore that with praise for a prominent Republican ally of the first President Bush. She also noted that two of her three brothers were Republicans and that she loved them very much.

The third reason I appreciated this debate is because it so perfectly underscored the most prominent candidates’ rationales for running and arguments for themselves. Apart from that odd exchange with Warren, Biden had a decent night, partly because he was given, and took advantage of, several opportunities to stress that he was more prepared for the presidency than anyone else and that the post-Trump era called for someone who wouldn’t have a steep learning curve. The repair work must begin immediately.

Buttigieg made clear that what he offers, at the tender age of 37, is a truly fresh perspective. He had a superb night, because he embraced a role as Warren’s inquisitor and because several supremely eloquent remarks about foreign policy — in particular, about Trump’s withdrawal of American troops from Syria — allowed him to project a command and maturity that some voters needed to see to consider him seriously.

Cory Booker quintupled down on his pitch as the candidate of love — and was so expansively loving to several of the other Democrats, including Kamala Harris and Biden, that I found myself wondering if this debate was a bid to salvage a flagging campaign or the beginning of an audition to be the eventual nominee’s running mate. As for Harris, she had strong moments, but they were neither strong nor frequent enough to alter her fortunes.

This was the most crowded televised presidential debate ever, with 12 candidates, so I’d need the column equivalent of “War and Peace” to appraise all of them. Still I’d feel remiss if I didn’t note that Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack, seemed no less vigorous than he had before.

But Warren, not Sanders, was carrying the progressive mantle on Tuesday night, when her less liberal competitors sought with a new assertiveness to trip her up. I don’t think that they quite succeeded.

Warren exits this latest debate as strong as she entered it. And those of us who watched it understand her — the calculations behind her positioning, the potential miscalculations of her monumentally expensive plans and the profound conviction she summons — better than ever before. That’s no small payoff for three long hours.

So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

Many Democratic strategists and officials have warned that the scrutiny on the Biden family has become a significant distraction for the former vice president, and poses perhaps the greatest threat yet to a candidacy that until recent weeks was well ahead in the polls. That makes it all the more urgent for Mr. Biden to land the kind of consistently fluent, forceful debate performance that has so far eluded him at a moment when Senator Elizabeth Warren has now surpassed him in some polls, Democratic operatives and activists said.

“I’m never a distraction to my dad, but as it relates to actually going and being onstage with him — this is not a family business,” Hunter Biden said Tuesday in the ABC interview, which aired on “Good Morning America’’ and was also excerpted online by the network. “Everybody kind of thinks that somehow, whether it’s a compliment that we’re like the Kennedys or whether it’s a, you know, backhanded compliment like you’re the Trumps, my dad has a, a job, but that does not mean that I have had any plans to go do rallies and, you know and, you know, talk about Donald Trump’s kids and I never will, you know, that’s not what Bidens do.”

At a news conference on Sunday, however, his father did appear to take some oblique swipes at the ethical practices of members of the Trump family, some of whom who have conducted their own overseas business dealings. And Hunter Biden seemed to be dismissive of Donald Trump Jr., who along with his father and brother have been highly critical of the Bidens.

“Donald Prince Humperdinck, um, Trump, Jr., is not somebody I really care about,” he said, an apparent reference to a character in the movie “The Princess Bride.”

In the interview, Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father.

“I’m taking it off the table,” he said. “I’m making that commitment. Let’s see if anybody else makes that commitment. But that’s the commitment that I’m making.”"

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

[music]

alexander burns

Thanks, Michael.

maggie haberman

Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

But the former vice president at first did not address part of a question at the Democratic presidential debate from Anderson Cooper, who asked whether it was appropriate for his son to have business dealings in Ukraine while Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Biden instead pivoted to Mr. Trump, and invoked the founding fathers.

“My son did nothing wrong,” Mr. Biden said. “I did nothing wrong.”

He continued:

“Look, the fact that George Washington on the first time he spoke after being elected, that we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.”

When pressed by Mr. Cooper in a follow-up question on whether his son should have had foreign business dealings during the Obama administration, Mr. Biden again said they had done nothing wrong."

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

(Mr. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the first place because of his request to the Ukrainian government that it look into what Mr. Biden did with the country’s officials when his son, Hunter Biden, was working for a gas company there.)

At the same time, others like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful to endorse only the impeachment inquiry and not necessarily impeachment itself.

Below is a partial transcript of the exchange on impeachment at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You’re all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach? Please respond."

That’s how the contenders for the party’s nomination framed the recent withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria under President Trump, who they said during Tuesday night’s debate had created turmoil with his impulsive foreign policy decision making.

“It’s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party’s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage.

It followed Mr. Trump’s decision this month to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, one that has been sharply criticized by Republicans and now Democrats, who said it would endanger Kurdish allies in the region. Mr. Trump said he was trying to “end the endless wars.”"

Watching without access to polling data, you might have imagined that this was some sort of wild careening mess of a primary race, when really it’s remarkably consolidated.

There is a Joe Biden constituency that seems stable at around 30 percent of the primary electorate. There is an Elizabeth Warren constituency that has expanded swiftly enough, especially in early states, to make her arguably the front-runner. There is a Bernie Sanders constituency that is about two-thirds the size of Warren’s and Biden’s peak and seemingly stuck there. And then, way down at around 5 percent and under, there is everybody else.

So a big question in this debate and in the ones before Iowa arrives and the also-rans begin to be formally run out is whether Democratic voters can be persuaded to reconsider this consolidation. And last night there were only really two candidates who presented themselves as plausible vehicles for that reconsideration: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.

As for the others — well, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are too niche, Beto O’Rourke is too limp, Julián Castro is too forgettable and Tom Steyer is too absurd. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker should be contenders, but Booker manages to be appealing at every debate without quite finding a rationale for his candidacy, while Harris has been on a weird self-destruct mission ever since her brief ascent — with her strange fight with Warren last night over whether Twitter should ban Donald Trump a particularly peculiar self-charted nose-dive."

Seven in 10 Democratic voters support mandatory buybacks, according to an August Quinnipiac poll, although less than half of all voters do.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs. Among Democrats, it’s a particularly winning concept; 86 percent of Democrats nationwide back the Green New Deal, the poll found."

He rebuked Representative Tulsi Gabbard on foreign policy. And, most notably, he engaged in the most substantive and sustained contrast of any candidate yet with Ms. Warren.

It was Mr. Buttigieg’s exchange with Ms. Warren over “Medicare for all” that was most memorable, pressing her as she declined to say, yet again, whether her plan would require a middle-class tax increase. (She says her plan would curb middle-class “costs.”)

“A yes-or-no question that did not get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg said, adding, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.” He rattled off how her plan would “obliterate” the private health insurance of 150 million Americans while pitching his “Medicare for all who want it” alternative.

Mr. Buttigieg’s rebuke of Mr. O’Rourke — “I don’t need lessons from you on courage” — may lend itself more to a viral moment. But the bigger leap was to be seen as a foil to Ms. Warren.

It felt at times on Tuesday as if the sprawling 12-person stage had actually narrowed to a four-person debate, with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders representing the left, and Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg representing the center-left. The occasional television shot of just those four served to hammer home the point."

Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey responded by adding that it was also the job of men to fight for women’s reproductive rights.

“God bless Kamala,” he said. “But you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight. It’s not just because women are our daughters and our friends and our wives. It’s because women are people.”

Later in the debate, the topic of reproductive rights emerged again when Ms. Harris was asked what she would do if states prevailed in further restricting abortion. Over the past year, Ohio, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri and Mississippi have passed bills that effectively prohibit abortions after six to eight weeks of pregnancy."

He seems to be addressing this thanks to everyone in the room, as if all those present have just burst into applause. (They haven’t.) He is merely Being Trump, doing what he does when he shows up anyplace, whether it’s a meeting of the Group of 7 or a wreath-laying commemoration at Arlington National Cemetery or a Super Bowl party at Mar-a-Lago: subjugating the entire purpose of the event to his own ego and id. It is a demeanor that announces that if anything is going to get done today, it will happen in spite, probably in defiance, of the president of the United States.

Trump wound up attending the climate meeting for about 15 minutes. There were more pressing matters to attend to. He posted on Twitter a dozen times that day, including tweets mocking Mitt Romney, Joe Biden and Adam Schiff. He also directed a trolling tweet at Thunberg: “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!”

We are not “all Greta Thunberg,” but all of us know what it’s like to be ambushed by Donald Trump. He pops up on your social media feed with hateful words and impulsive policy announcements.

No matter who you are or what you’re trying to accomplish, whether you’re a 16-year-old working to save the planet or an ordinary citizen trying to make it through the day with some peace of mind intact, you will inevitably confront the specter of Trump, drifting into the frame in a cloud of disorder and bad vibes. Even the president’s most dedicated enablers scan the sky warily, awaiting today’s cyclone, the next reckless, capricious twist of the plot. The door swings open, the president enters, all heads turn.

Ultimately, that was what happened. The Justice Department, which was led at the time by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, did not see merit in deporting Mr. Gulen, said one former official familiar with the matter.

Throughout 2017, before Mr. Giuliani began representing Mr. Trump as his personal lawyer, he appeared at the White House to discuss a number of issues related to Turkey, according to two former administration officials. At one point, officials tried to divert Mr. Giuliani’s access to the president so that he was raising his issues with the president’s senior advisers instead of Mr. Trump directly.

Also on Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani’s lawyer, Jon A. Sale, said in a letter to the House Intelligence Committee that he would not hand over documents to the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry because the information requested was “beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry” and a violation of attorney-client and executive privilege.

In a confrontational tweet that echoed the president’s condemnation of the investigations, Mr. Giuliani said he “will not participate in an illegitimate, unconstitutional, and baseless ‘impeachment inquiry.’”

Mr. Giuliani appeared to reject the idea that his decision to defy the subpoena would place him in any legal jeopardy. He said in his tweet that Mr. Sale would no longer be representing him on impeachment matters.

“At this time, I do not need a lawyer,” Mr. Giuliani wrote.

A spokeswoman for the committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Giuliani’s letter.

Mr. Kent had raised concerns to colleagues early this year about pressure being directed at Ukraine by President Trump and Rudy Giuliani to pursue investigations into Mr. Trump’s political rivals.

Mr. Kent’s testimony followed a pattern that has emerged among recent witnesses. The State Department directed Mr. Kent not to appear and sought to limit his testimony, according to officials familiar with the investigation. But the House Intelligence Committee issued a last-minute subpoena, and he complied.

Tuesday was the document deadline for Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Giuliani, the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Pence and the O.M.B. rejected the requests. A lawyer for Mr. Giuliani sent a letter to House officials saying that Mr. Giuliani would not comply with the subpoena he was issued.

How this impeachment is different

Investigators this week are calling in witnesses who aren’t typically part of the Washington news cycle: a former Russia specialist on the National Security Council, the ambassador to the European Union, a deputy assistant secretary of defense.

The range of voices puts this impeachment investigation in new historical territory, according to Philip Bobbitt, a professor at Columbia Law School and a co-author with Charles Black of “Impeachment: A Handbook.”

The Clinton impeachment had little to do with governance, Mr. Bobbit told me.

“It had nothing to do with foreign policy or defense policy,” he said. “And in Nixon’s case, there were maybe a couple of dozen people involved.”

The inquiry so far has leaned on witness depositions in addition to traditional evidentiary material like transcripts, which were a mainstay for investigators organizing the case against President Richard Nixon."

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis. The two freshmen are a favorite target of conservatives, who have caricatured them as the true leaders of their party."

Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said of Mr. Kent, after departing from the room where he was being deposed.

“And that was wrong,” Mr. Connolly said. “He used that word, ‘wrong.’”

After the May 23 meeting called by Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Kent told investigators, he and others whose portfolios included Ukraine were edged out by Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union; Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine; and Rick Perry, the energy secretary, who “declared themselves the three people now responsible for Ukraine policy,” Mr. Connolly said.

The meeting occurred on the same day that Mr. Sondland, Mr. Volker and Mr. Perry urged Mr. Trump in an Oval Office briefing to support and arrange a White House meeting for the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, from whose inauguration they had just returned. It was unclear if the meeting described by Mr. Kent was the same one or another session.

Mr. Trump replied skeptically, telling the group that Ukrainian politicians are “all corrupt.” In the weeks after that, Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker began working with Mr. Giuliani to urge Mr. Zelensky to commit to the investigations sought by Mr. Trump.

Mr. Kent said he was told at another point to “lay low” on Ukraine matters.

The accounts are trickling out even as the White House seeks to block even more information from surfacing in the impeachment inquiry. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday defied a request by investigators for documents related to the inquiry, and the Defense Department, the Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Giuliani all gave notice that they would defy subpoenas to turn over material. All of them cited the lack of a House vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry as grounds for stonewalling."

Obama, Levingston writes, was “a young, cerebral African-American who sweated over the precision of his words”; Biden was “an older chummy white guy given to impulsively speaking his mind.” Obama considered Biden a Washington blowhard; listening to one of Biden’s long-winded speeches during a Senate hearing, he wrote a note to an aide: “Shoot. Me. Now.” Biden, for his part, believed Obama to be an impudent tyro. But when Obama needed to choose a running mate, Biden — with his decades of Senate experience and his popularity among white, working-class voters in Rust Belt states — checked the right boxes. During the campaign and then in the White House, their relationship developed and deepened, to the point that, in 2014, when Biden considered taking out a second mortgage to help pay for his son Beau’s brain cancer treatments, Obama told him not to and that, if necessary, he would give Biden the money himself. “Barack and Joe filled in the spaces that were missing in the other man and created something bigger than their separate parts,” Levingston writes. They were “a perfectly matched odd couple.”

Levingston spends much of “Barack and Joe” dwelling on the public-facing aspect of — and public response to — their “bromance.” He quotes from both men’s Twitter and Instagram accounts; late-night hosts, cable news gasbags and internet meme-makers are all frequently cited. And he attempts to tease out why those who were “observing the president and vice president from a distance” were so invested in Obama and Biden’s relationship. Part of it, Levingston theorizes, was that “America had a weakness for buddy teams. Felix and Oscar. Bert and Ernie. Buzz and Woody.” More interestingly, he argues that Obama and Biden’s partnership, “just by its existence and daily workings … served as a badge of racial harmony.”

What “Barack and Joe” fails to do is shed much new light on the private nature of the two men’s relationship. The nonfiction book editor of The Washington Post, Levingston has combed through the memoirs of Obama administration officials, as well as a number of other journalists’ books, for anecdotes and insights about events that transpired behind the scenes, but he appears to have done little original reporting of his own, interviewing only a handful of people who observed the relationship up close. (Noting that Obama and Biden both declined to be interviewed for his book, Levingston writes, “It has seemed curious to me that, despite their busy schedules, Barack and Joe could not find time to discuss their complicated but largely felicitous relationship.”)

As a result, “Barack and Joe” frequently reads like a rehash of episodes and events that are already well known, with seemingly minor matters being afforded undue significance if only because they’ve previously been well documented. Does the world in 2019, for instance, really need 20 pages on the “Beer Summit” — the 2009 pseudo-event in which Biden and Obama hoisted beers in the Rose Garden with the black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates and the white Cambridge police officer who mistakenly arrested him? Even worse, “Barack and Joe” is written in a cloying style — “Barack and Joe, no longer opponents, were now able to move into a new phase with each other,” or “Through straight talk over lunch, Barack and Joe resolved their spat” — that seems better suited to a children’s book than a sophisticated political account.

That’s a shame, because with Biden now casting his third presidential run as an attempt to create a third Obama term, it’s never been more important to understand the true and substantive nature of the two men’s political partnership. For all the affectionate lunch outings and bro-hugs that lit up the internet, Obama nonetheless dissuaded Biden from running for president in 2016, instead putting his chips on Hillary Clinton. And in the 2020 race, Obama hasn’t endorsed Biden — or anyone else — in the Democratic primaries. The two men’s friendship may have “moved the nation” as no White House pairing ever had, as Levingston writes. But was it — and should it be — enough to move one of them back into the White House?"

Focusing only on taxes is pointless. But in a larger way, she’s wrong.

The No. 1 reason to question her version of Medicare for All — in which private health insurance would be eliminated — is its political viability. It would be an enormous disruption to the health care system, and history shows that health care disruptions are very hard to pass and usually unpopular at first. Polls show that her plan is already unpopular, and it would be a bigger disruption than Obamacare or Bill Clinton’s failed plan.

Given all that, she needs to engage with the political realities — with how she would overcome people’s resistance to giving up their health insurance for a larger new program that, yes, would require a tax increase.

I think Warren has run an excellent campaign on the whole, and I think she has the most thoughtful agenda for addressing the stagnating living standards of most Americans. I’m surprised that she has chosen to focus so much of her candidacy on the most aggressive version of Medicare for All. But she has. Now it’s time for her to tell voters how she will deal with the politics of passing it.

In my view, her best answer involves finding a way to signal her openness to a transition, in which people who want to keep their private insurance can do so (and taxes don’t yet need to rise) while Medicare initially expands voluntarily. That idea is hugely popular."

Re “Race Takes Turn as Warren Faces Barrage Onstage” (front page, Oct. 16):

After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:

My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.

But I felt the same way about Hillary Clinton and look how that turned out.

The others do nothing for this 65-year-old longtime Democrat. So how do I vote? I don’t know.

To the Editor:

What struck me most about Tuesday night was how articulate all of the candidates were in expressing their positions compared with the muddled thoughts and language we’ve heard from President Trump ever since he appeared on the national stage.

I watched the debate in a venue sponsored by supporters of Pete Buttigieg. He had some good moments. Then I wondered how he would stack up against Mr. Trump one on one: Would Americans appreciate Pete’s depth and calm or rally to re-elect the pompous bully Trump?"

Voters Who Want to Like Them?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/opinion/democrats-debate-republicans.html,"The best example of how candidates botch their approach is on the issue of abortion. A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v. Wade, but a longstanding 80 percent of them support restrictions of some kind (according to 2019 Gallup polling), most notably in the third trimester (as of 2018 Gallup polling, 65 percent support restrictions in second trimester as well). Only Senator Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Gabbard have admitted to supporting third-trimester restrictions. The rest, including the current front-runners Senator Elizabeth Warren and the former vice president Joe Biden, have offered rare consideration for restrictions or conversation around why such large portions of the country support them.

Abortion and reproductive rights may not be a “deal breaker” vote for swing voters, as a recent Fox News poll revealed, but it is an issue that matters deeply to them, especially those who hold faith in high regard. More to the point, it’s curious that so many Democratic candidates hold a view consistent with so few voters. No one should swap genuine beliefs about abortion to appease polling numbers, but if these candidates represent the American people, they are statistically divergent from them in a dramatic way. This may mean a few of them are hiding their authentic beliefs about abortion for political safety — but that’s to their detriment.

The answer for candidates isn’t necessarily changing policy positions but offering room for conversation with those who support restrictions and respect for an alternative position that is rooted in genuine beliefs about the origins of life.

Even Mr. Biden, viewed as a moderate, has disappointed on the issue, reversing his long-held position on banning federal funds for abortion. This has damaged his “moderate” brand slightly. He has also given into relentless badgering from progressives, endorsing the Green New Deal and bowing to liberal sexual politics with his recent announcement that he would support men who identify as women being housed with females in prison.

All of this leftward marching, for Mr. Biden and others, moves candidates further from potential voters it’s necessary to win over. These folks may not vote for Mr. Trump (or vote at all), but Democrats stand to lose this opening with them for good. Now is the time to put formerly Republican voters on notice, as Ms. Gabbard has done with her distinctive approach.

They crave the anti-Trump, not a hypocritical Kamala Harris and her indefensible record on criminal justice. Ms. Harris describes herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” but infamously upheld multiple wrongful conviction cases and failed to support a ballot initiative that would reduce penalties for nonviolent crimes. These voters also have little interest in an opportunistic Mayor Pete Buttigieg: For years in Indiana politics, he worked “cordially” with Mike Pence, then the governor, but only since becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party has the mayor chosen to demean Mr. Pence’s religious beliefs.

Ms. Gabbard and Ms. Klobuchar — who also tends to focus on winnable, bipartisan issues like lowering the price of prescription drugs — appear to be the only two candidates to understand this opportunity for new votes."

Let’s do, to borrow a word from Andrew Yang’s lapel pin, the math. There were 12 candidates onstage Tuesday, any of whom could have had exchanges with one or more of the others. That made for (counts on fingers) a lot of different interpersonal dynamics. The debate was scheduled for three hours, yet — even with formal opening and closing statements dispensed with — it still ran long.

So there was room for a great number of debates within this debate, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times. This debate had many rooms. It had geologic ages. I believe that somewhere in there, they awarded the Oscar for Best Picture. It is said that near its beginning, the candidates argued about the merits of Medicare for All and how to pay for it, but those are only rumors; no written records remain from that time.

Tonight, 12 Democratic candidates will be debating near Columbus, Ohio. Here’s what I’ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

Sanders, Warren and Steyer Debate It - The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/us-billionaires.html,"BURNETT: Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

STEYER: First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise — 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.

If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included productivity gains of American workers, it would be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president. Because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants — health care, education, Green New Deal or a living wage — unless we break the power of these corporations.

BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?

BIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth — what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea — we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said — a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are — there’s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can’t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly — thirdly — what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We are going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting in buying back their stock."

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Hello?

Michael.

michael barbaro

Good morning.

maggie haberman

Right. Yes, it is.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

We’ll be right back.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Mr. Biden’s treasury now ranks fifth in the Democratic field, also behind Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had $10.5 million in the bank, though her $911,000 in unpaid bills — to her pollster, media buyer and lawyers, among others — meant that her functional cash on hand was closer to $9.6 million.

The self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and reported spending $47 million , also has more financial resources than Mr. Biden heading toward the Iowa caucuses, which are less than four months away.

Right. Yes, it is.

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now “dig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,” carrying his message from the debate — a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies — into the early states where he’s polling in fourth place.

I know what the job is. I’ve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on Day 1 can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required, now more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on Day 1. That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before. I’ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I’ve been there, and I’ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.

Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?

WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people’s lives, things like child care and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight."

It Was the Worst of Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/democratic-debate-ohio.html,"She was referring to Tom Steyer, who was making his Democratic-debate debut.

Warren said that she had nothing against billionaires per se and wasn’t in the demonization business. She was in the justice business. And with her final remarks, she sought to underscore that with praise for a prominent Republican ally of the first President Bush. She also noted that two of her three brothers were Republicans and that she loved them very much.

The third reason I appreciated this debate is because it so perfectly underscored the most prominent candidates’ rationales for running and arguments for themselves. Apart from that odd exchange with Warren, Biden had a decent night, partly because he was given, and took advantage of, several opportunities to stress that he was more prepared for the presidency than anyone else and that the post-Trump era called for someone who wouldn’t have a steep learning curve. The repair work must begin immediately.

Buttigieg made clear that what he offers, at the tender age of 37, is a truly fresh perspective. He had a superb night, because he embraced a role as Warren’s inquisitor and because several supremely eloquent remarks about foreign policy — in particular, about Trump’s withdrawal of American troops from Syria — allowed him to project a command and maturity that some voters needed to see to consider him seriously.

Cory Booker quintupled down on his pitch as the candidate of love — and was so expansively loving to several of the other Democrats, including Kamala Harris and Biden, that I found myself wondering if this debate was a bid to salvage a flagging campaign or the beginning of an audition to be the eventual nominee’s running mate. As for Harris, she had strong moments, but they were neither strong nor frequent enough to alter her fortunes.

This was the most crowded televised presidential debate ever, with 12 candidates, so I’d need the column equivalent of “War and Peace” to appraise all of them. Still I’d feel remiss if I didn’t note that Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack, seemed no less vigorous than he had before.

But Warren, not Sanders, was carrying the progressive mantle on Tuesday night, when her less liberal competitors sought with a new assertiveness to trip her up. I don’t think that they quite succeeded.

Warren exits this latest debate as strong as she entered it. And those of us who watched it understand her — the calculations behind her positioning, the potential miscalculations of her monumentally expensive plans and the profound conviction she summons — better than ever before. That’s no small payoff for three long hours.

“So he sent that letter on Oct. 9th. Erdogan immediately sent his tanks across the border. So it was insane and ineffective, which is the art of the deal.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “And you know, it’s funny, because on this very day on Oct. 16 — 57 years ago — the Cuban missile crisis started, and this letter from Trump is eerily similar to a letter J.F.K. sent Khrushchev when we found out the Soviets were putting nukes in Cuba. Well, he wrote, at that time: ‘Dear Premier Khrushchev, don’t be a [expletive], O.K.? Get your missiles out of Cuba. Everybody will say, ‘Yay, Cruise Ship! You’re the best.’ But if you don’t, everybody will be like, ‘What an [expletive]’ and call your garbage country ‘The Soviet Bunion.’” — JIMMY KIMMEL

Yeah. Because the Houston Rockets G.M. slammed China on Twitter when LeBron was on his way to China. So LeBron was probably like, ‘Hey, man, start this beef after I leave. What’s wrong with you, man? I’m going there.’ Because I would do the same thing. Like, if you asked me in China what I thought about China’s policies, I would be like, ‘I think China has policies, and they’re the policies that allow me to fly home from China.’” — TREVOR NOAH

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Joseph R. Biden Jr. pushed back against President Trump’s attack on his son’s business dealings, saying that the attention should instead be on Mr. Trump’s actions of inviting a foreign power into the election and not on the controversy sparked by unfounded conspiracies about the overseas business dealings of his son Hunter.

But the former vice president at first did not address part of a question at the Democratic presidential debate from Anderson Cooper, who asked whether it was appropriate for his son to have business dealings in Ukraine while Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Biden instead pivoted to Mr. Trump, and invoked the founding fathers.

“My son did nothing wrong,” Mr. Biden said. “I did nothing wrong.”

He continued:

“Look, the fact that George Washington on the first time he spoke after being elected, that we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.”

When pressed by Mr. Cooper in a follow-up question on whether his son should have had foreign business dealings during the Obama administration, Mr. Biden again said they had done nothing wrong."

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp.

At the same time, others like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful to endorse only the impeachment inquiry and not necessarily impeachment itself.

Below is a partial transcript of the exchange on impeachment at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You’re all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach? Please respond."
341,Ross Douthat,"That leaves Buttigieg and Klobuchar, who both did well for themselves by arguing explicitly with Warren from more centrist ground and embracing the clearest rationales for their candidacies which happen to be the same basic rationale: that theyre problem-solv… [+1845 chars]",Can Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar fight back against the primary field’s consolidation?,2019-10-16,The New York Times,A Night for the Not-Bidens,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/presidential-debate-ohio.html,"The ridiculous number of candidates on the Democratic stage last night created a fundamentally misleading aural and visual impression. Watching without access to polling data, you might have imagined that this was some sort of wild careening mess of a primary race, when really it’s remarkably consolidated.

There is a Joe Biden constituency that seems stable at around 30 percent of the primary electorate. There is an Elizabeth Warren constituency that has expanded swiftly enough, especially in early states, to make her arguably the front-runner. There is a Bernie Sanders constituency that is about two-thirds the size of Warren’s and Biden’s peak and seemingly stuck there. And then, way down at around 5 percent and under, there is everybody else.

So a big question in this debate and in the ones before Iowa arrives and the also-rans begin to be formally run out is whether Democratic voters can be persuaded to reconsider this consolidation. And last night there were only really two candidates who presented themselves as plausible vehicles for that reconsideration: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.

As for the others — well, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are too niche, Beto O’Rourke is too limp, Julián Castro is too forgettable and Tom Steyer is too absurd. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker should be contenders, but Booker manages to be appealing at every debate without quite finding a rationale for his candidacy, while Harris has been on a weird self-destruct mission ever since her brief ascent — with her strange fight with Warren last night over whether Twitter should ban Donald Trump a particularly peculiar self-charted nose-dive."

That’s how the contenders for the party’s nomination framed the recent withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria under President Trump, who they said during Tuesday night’s debate had created turmoil with his impulsive foreign policy decision making.

“It’s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party’s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage.

It followed Mr. Trump’s decision this month to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, one that has been sharply criticized by Republicans and now Democrats, who said it would endanger Kurdish allies in the region. Mr. Trump said he was trying to “end the endless wars.”"

The House speaker is walking by with a very significant entourage. That was Nancy Pelosi. That was cool. O.K. So what are we doing? Oh, we’re waiting for Nick to get off the phone. clare toeniskoetter We also could say hi. michael barbaro I have a croissant I’d like to finish.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

michael barbaro

Today —

speaker 1 Nothing further at this moment. speaker 2 Does this move the ball for impeachment, in your mind?

michael barbaro

A week inside the U.S. Capitol as the impeachment inquiry enters a pivotal phase. It’s Friday, October 18.

nicholas fandos There’s a bunch of rooms, so — michael barbaro O.K. clare toeniskoetter What’s going on? michael barbaro We’re just trying to find a room that is quiet enough to make an episode of “The Daily.” nicholas fandos I think this will work.

michael barbaro

O.K. Here we go. Nick Fandos, you’ve been on the Hill all week. Walk me through this. What does the impeachment inquiry actually look like on the ground?

nicholas fandos

Yeah. So, I mean, the crazy thing is that the house opened this impeachment inquiry a little more than three weeks ago now on their way out of town for a two-week recess. So members were scattered all over the country, meeting with constituents, holding town halls, while back here in the Capitol, a core group of staff members, basically, for the House Intelligence Committee and a couple of others, stuck around and began issuing subpoenas and requests, setting up the very first witness depositions for their investigation. And so this week was the week that five of those depositions, one a day, were lined up, and lawmakers were going to be coming back. So that’s kind of what I was expecting when I arrived at the Capitol on Monday.

rachel quester Hello. nicholas fandos Hey, it’s Nick. rachel quester Hi, how’s it going?

nicholas fandos

And I met up with our colleagues from “The Daily,” Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter, who were going to spend the week with me.

nicholas fandos It’s so nice outside. rachel quester It’s so nice outside.

nicholas fandos

We had to meet up outside of the Capitol because it was Columbus Day, actually. The press galleries and all the functional staff were not working here. So I had to escort them in specially. We walked inside and down three sets of stairs.

clare toeniskoetter Where are we? nicholas fandos We’re standing now beside the doors to the House Intelligence Committee SCIF.

nicholas fandos

And at the bottom of those stairs, we end up at the secured rooms, we call it the SCIF, of the House Intelligence Committee —

clare toeniskoetter Wait, SCIF? Secure — nicholas fandos Compartmentalized Information Facility.

nicholas fandos

— which is one of the most secretive in Congress. It’s where this investigation is taking place, all behind closed doors.

nicholas fandos And they have these red stickers on them, which get photographed all the time and are always in the newspaper, which just say “restricted area.” You can’t go there.

nicholas fandos

So the three of us and a bunch of reporters were gathered around outside, basically waiting for any emissaries to come out of the room and give some sense of what was going on back there with the very first witness deposition.

nicholas fandos We spend all day trying to mentally pierce that barrier.

michael barbaro

So it says something about this week that this room is where Congress is holding these hearings.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, that’s right. I mean, it’s entirely outside of the public view. This is an investigation that could result in an attempt to remove President Trump. And the earliest stages of the investigation, at least, are all being conducted out of public view. And this has been a source of some contention early on.

archived recording (jim jordan) The first two interviews, totalling approximately 20 hours, not one single thing was said in those respective interviews that the American people should not be able to see, should not be able to hear.

nicholas fandos

Republicans have really seized on it to accuse Democrats of, basically, trying to impeach Trump in private —

archived recording (jim jordan) The tragedy here, and the crime here, is that the American people don’t get to see what’s going on in these sessions.

nicholas fandos

— of hiding important work from the American people and from the press, who might be able to evaluate it. And the Democrats argue, though, that basically, this is investigative best practice. That, unlike past impeachments, they don’t already know what the story is. They need to find out the details. And the best way to investigate it is in private, where witnesses can’t line up their stories by hearing what somebody else testified, where lawyers can ask most of the questions, rather than lawmakers who are, maybe, trying to fundraise off of some quip, or speak to their constituents at a public hearing. And this allows them, ideally, to move quickly and collect a lot of information efficiently. And then, they figure out, what have we found? And what is the best of what we’ve got? And they move that, then, into the public sphere. And they present that evidence, they invite their best witnesses to come and testify, and they can kind of control the story that they’re building against the president.

michael barbaro

Much like a prosecutor, or a district attorney, quietly builds a case, makes an announcement of whether or not there’s an indictment, and then goes to trial.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. The rub, of course, is that this is Congress. And politicians love to blab. They get information that looks damaging to the president. If you’re a Democrat, you’d love for that to get out.

michael barbaro

So what’s the situation on Monday when it comes to these hearings? What’s actually happening in that SCIF, behind those closed doors?

nicholas fandos

So for most of the day Monday, all I know is that this former White House official, Fiona Hill, is in there testifying. And it’s hour after hour after hour. There’s very little information coming out. My feet are getting sore.

nicholas fandos Hey. Are you still free?

nicholas fandos

Chit-chatting with other reporters. Basically waiting for any kind of emissary to come out of the room and give us a sense of what’s going on.

nicholas fandos It seems pretty quiet. I think Schiff just left to go — he’s speaking at the 92nd Street Y.

michael barbaro

You’re just spending the day standing outside this room.

nicholas fandos

Right.

nicholas fandos [SIGHS] clare toeniskoetter How many hours do you think you’ve spent standing, waiting, doing nothing so far? nicholas fandos I don’t know. Probably north of 30 hours, 35 hours. But it’ll get worse.

nicholas fandos

And it was a long day. And, eventually, the sun goes down. Fiona Hill is still not done. And she finally leaves at about 8 o’clock.

clare toeniskoetter Bye, thank you!

nicholas fandos

I just kind of had to go home. Because there was not a whole lot more reporting to do here.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

nicholas fandos

And it was only as I was walking back up to my apartment building that I started hearing from some sources and being able to piece together, over the next couple of hours, what had actually happened that day. And the testimony, it turns out, was pretty remarkable.

michael barbaro

What was the testimony?

nicholas fandos

So you’ve got to keep in mind, Fiona Hill is a respected career Russia expert who was brought in to the Trump administration to work for John Bolton on the National Security Council as one of the president’s top advisers on Europe and Russia policy. So she’s right at the center of traditional decision making around policy towards Ukraine. And the account that she gives is that there was a meeting earlier this summer in July where several other diplomats, including Gordon Sondland, a former Trump donor who had become ambassador to the European Union, met with some Ukrainian officials. And she tells lawmakers that this meeting veered dangerously off course, from her perspective, and that she and her boss, John Bolton, were so alarmed by what was said that Bolton told her, you need to go to White House lawyers right now and tell them that we’re not part of, and this was a quote, “whatever drug deal” these guys are cooking up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

Not a literal drug deal. But what Bolton and Hill thought was going on is that Sondland and the president’s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were basically holding out from the Ukrainians a White House meeting with President Trump, which is what they wanted, as leverage for the Ukrainians agreeing to investigate Democrats and Democratic issues that could benefit the president politically. Hill also testified that, at one point, Bolton referred to Giuliani as a “hand grenade” that’s “going to blow everybody up.” And so we were able to basically pull together this and some other elements of the story and publish it, I think, about 10:30 at night, and really be able to tell the story of day one behind those closed doors.

michael barbaro

So beyond this being a very juicy scoop, what’s the significance of the testimony that Fiona Hill gave? What does it do for the inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So there are a couple things that I would say. One is that she implicates her boss, John Bolton, who is a boldface name in Washington. He’s the president’s top national security adviser. And saying that high up in the chain, the president’s national security adviser is calling this a “drug deal,” was so concerned about this he had me go to the lawyers — and it kind of opened the door to the fact that this set of events that we’re learning about in retrospect were setting off alarms in real time, and at very high levels of the government. The other aspect of it, though, is that I’m looking ahead to the rest of the week, and it seems pretty clear she’s not going to be the last person. Unlike in past investigations, where the White House has successfully shut down Congress, important witnesses are coming, and they’re going to talk, and they’re going to tell their story. We’re actually going to understand what happened here.

michael barbaro

Nick, I guess I just have, like, a collegial inquiry here. What’s the point of standing around all day if you end up getting the best stuff when you get home at, like, 10 o’clock at night?

nicholas fandos

[LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Doesn’t that suggest that maybe you’re not going about this in the most efficient way?

nicholas fandos

Uhh, it’s a fair point. But we do learn some pretty significant details that set the stage for the rest of the week.

michael barbaro

O.K. So what happens the next day, on Tuesday?

rachel quester Ready for day two. clare toeniskoetter Yeah.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday, we know that there is going to be another one of these closed-door depositions that’s probably going to go on again for hours, this time with a senior State Department official who was more or less in charge of Ukraine policy for the State Department.

speaker 1 So Julie’s group, we’re going to gather up. Make sure we have everybody. I don’t see Brian. speaker 2 I don’t either.

nicholas fandos

But the first thing that I notice as I arrive at the Capitol is that the place has been transformed overnight.

rachel quester O.K., so Nick just walked away, because he got a call from a member of Congress.

nicholas fandos

After two weeks of recess, lawmakers are back.

speaker Madam Speaker, will there be an formal vote on an impeachment inquiry? Madam Speaker?

nicholas fandos

There are even tourists wandering around through the SCIF area, running into reporters.

speaker 1 In part to keep an eye on the British. speaker 2 Yeah, it’s somewhere up there. Oh, wait. There we go.

nicholas fandos

Stopping, looking at the TV reporters, who they recognize from CNN.

speaker 1 Have you guys heard of the whole impeachment inquiry? speaker 2 Mm-hmm. speaker 3 Yeah. That’s craziness.

nicholas fandos

The press corps seems to have somehow doubled. I don’t know how, because it’s already been huge following this stuff. And there’s just kind of an energy gripping the place that comes with 535 or so lawmakers and their staff, their kind of entourages, being back, moving around the Capitol.

michael barbaro

Can any member of Congress walk into the SCIF, right by you, and actually listen to these depositions as testimony?

nicholas fandos

The answer is no. And we actually saw it a couple times this week, when Republicans tried to go in and sit in on these depositions. But they were not on the committees that are leading the investigation. And therefore, under the committee rules, they ended up getting kicked out. But with lawmakers back in town, you’re talking about three committees that are leading the impeachment investigation. That’s dozens and dozens of lawmakers that sit on those. And they can all go and sit in. And they can come out, and they’re not supposed to talk in detail about what transpired, but they can give general impressions and hints about what they heard. In one case, one Democrat came out and basically broke the rules and just talked about what was happening completely.

archived recording How did the questioning go today, Gerry? archived recording (gerry connolly) I thought it was very powerful testimony.

michael barbaro

And what did this Democrat divulge?

nicholas fandos

So he comes out and says —

archived recording (gerry connolly) Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine —

nicholas fandos

— that he’d just heard the witness in the room, a State Department official named George Kent —

archived recording (gerry connolly) — who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine.

nicholas fandos

— that he and other career diplomats who were in charge of the State Department’s policy toward Ukraine had been shoved aside —

archived recording (gerry connolly) All of the people charged with policy in Ukraine were replaced, apparently, after a May 23rd meeting at the White House organized by Mick Mulvaney, not John Bolton or Pompeo.

nicholas fandos

— and were told, starting late in the spring, that basically, their services weren’t needed anymore —

archived recording (gerry connolly) And that was wrong. He used that word, “wrong.”

nicholas fandos

— that policy towards Ukraine was going to be run by Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, and others out of the White House —

archived recording (gerry connolly) The import of this testimony is deeply disturbing, especially the role of Rudy Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

— and they may as well lay low.

michael barbaro

And what’s the significance of that?

nicholas fandos

So the significance of that is that you have here another high-level American diplomat saying that the normal channels for foreign policy that have guided American policy for quite a long time are being stepped on, basically, by the White House, which is putting their own guys in charge. And one of them that he singles out, yet again, is Gordon Sondland. Now you have a second witness, two in two days, coming forward and giving a pretty consistent account. This is all picking up a little bit of momentum.

michael barbaro

So I’m taking it you didn’t watch the Democratic debate.

nicholas fandos

I did not watch the Democratic debate, and I did not watch playoff baseball.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

nicholas fandos

What if we take a 20-minute break, and I can go and satisfy my editors a little bit by updating some stories?

michael barbaro

Yeah. All right. We’ll be back, as we say.

nicholas fandos

O.K. More soon.

clare toeniskoetter Thanks, Nick. nicholas fandos You guys going to hang here? michael barbaro Yeah. rachel quester O.K. Should we go to break there?

michael barbaro

That was the idea.

clare toeniskoetter See ya!

michael barbaro

O.K. So Wednesday.

nicholas fandos

Wednesday. Another day, another diplomat. This time, it’s a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who quit the State Department last week, reportedly because he was so frustrated by the very things that we’re talking about. He tried to raise alarms by that and didn’t get a response. And he was so fed up, he said he quit. So it’s clear after three days of testimony that we’re starting to see the diplomatic and foreign policy core, the expertise, the professional class that handles American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican administrations, basically coming one by one to tell a remarkably consistent story about how, in ways that they were uncomfortable with and they had not seen before, they were getting pushed aside. And the policy that was being executed in their place — they would say it’s not even a policy — but the actions in their place, basically, rather than, to put it in their words, the policy serving the well-being of the Ukrainians and the United States, it was serving the well-being of the president of the United States. And that was about it.

michael barbaro

But how exactly is that the basis of an impeachment inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not the fact that they were pushed aside that they see as so problematic. They’re telling a story about what happened once they were pushed aside. They think that’s created a set of conditions that led to these events that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. And that’s really what investigators are trying to get to the bottom of. And now, they’ve been able to establish how the circumstances, or the scene, was set for those things to happen by these current and former diplomats. But they still have more investigative work to flesh that out. ^CLARE TOENISKOETTER^ O.K., we’re walking up.

speaker All right. So I’m going to just watch for — nicholas fandos If that’s O.K. speaker Yeah, yeah.

nicholas fandos

So in the middle of all this on Wednesday, I meet up with my colleague, Sheryl Stolberg.

nicholas fandos Yeah, we’ll probably go to one of those tables. sheryl gay stolberg You think it’ll be a standing interview? nicholas fandos I hope not. But, you know, a guy’s got to get his steps in.

nicholas fandos

And we’re going to go upstairs into the Capitol to interview Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who chairs the Intelligence Committee and is the man at the center of all these hearings leading the impeachment investigation. We had been hoping to sit down with Schiff in his office and have a kind of quieter, more reflective meeting. But indicative of the way things are in the middle of this inquiry, his staff asked, instead, if we could meet in a reception room.

sheryl gay stolberg Let’s take this corner.

nicholas fandos

Right off the floor of the Capitol, where there were different meet-and-greets going on, and constituents were meeting with their members of Congress. And the room was buzzing and lively. And we staked out a corner where we could talk to Congressman Schiff.

adam schiff How are you doing? nicholas fandos How are you? adam schiff Good. nicholas fandos Here, and Sheryl’s over here too. sheryl gay stolberg Hi! adam schiff Hi, how are you?

nicholas fandos

And we were able to put to him some, kind of, key questions about what we thought was going on to see how he sees it.

sheryl gay stolberg You know, the president talks a lot about the deep state. Does it strike you that this is exactly what he fears, or what he thinks of as the deep state? adam schiff You know, the deep state theory used to be a fringe theory in third-world countries or kooky conspiracy theorists at home. When the president talks about the deep state, what he’s really talking about is, in particular, people that expose his wrongdoing and misconduct.

nicholas fandos

At one point, we put the question to him of what he made of all these diplomats coming forward and telling this story.

adam schiff You know, there’s no revolt, and there’s no deep state. sheryl gay stolberg I’m being —

nicholas fandos

He quibbled a little bit with the wording that Sheryl used. But he basically said, I agree with the premise of the question.

adam schiff I think it’s a very serious attack on career public servants who are unwilling to compromise themselves in the president’s service. This has to be the last question because I’ve got to go vote on the last vote. sheryl gay stolberg I have two more real quickies. Do you have enough evidence to impeach? adam schiff I’ve got to go vote. sheryl gay stolberg Can he come back or is that it? nicholas fandos I can ask.

michael barbaro

So another busy day. Where is your head as Wednesday comes to an end?

nicholas fandos

So by the end of Wednesday, it just feels inescapable that this is all building, at least this week, towards Gordon Sondland coming in himself on Thursday and giving his account of what happened, of facing questions about these various accusations and accounts that investigators have been getting all week. And figuring out, how does he explain this stuff? How does he view what was going on? And we left the Capitol Wednesday evening waiting to see exactly what he was going to say.

michael barbaro

Right. Like, if this is a play, the character that everyone’s been talking about for the last 90 minutes eventually has to come onstage and say something.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Except for, in this case, the stage is behind closed doors. And saying something, it turns out, amounts to releasing an 18-page opening statement Thursday morning right before he begins to answer questions.

nicholas fandos Hello. michael barbaro Hi. nicholas fandos Welcome. michael barbaro Very nice to see you. nicholas fandos Very nice to see you.

michael barbaro

So that’s how Thursday morning begins. I walk into the Capitol with Rachel and Clare just as, it seems, you are digesting Gordon Sondland’s opening statements.

nicholas fandos And my morning was basically spent trying to go through 18 pages of what he was going to go in there and say.

nicholas fandos

We received a copy of his opening statement. And Mike Schmidt, our colleague, and I pored through it to try and figure out, what’s new here? What’s he addressing? What does he have to say? And a couple of things jumped out at us. He basically says, in a meeting that he had with President Trump in May, not long after the new Ukrainian president is elected, President Trump basically rejected Sondland’s advice and the advice of other diplomats that were with him who said, you know, Mr. President, we think you ought to meet with this new guy. We think he’s going to do good work. Trump didn’t seem interested, and then directed them, Sondland said, to go through Rudy Giuliani, to go through his private lawyer.

michael barbaro

On Ukraine foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

He gave Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, and other high-ranking officials in the room the direct impression that he had empowered Rudy Giuliani to basically run American policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

I mean, all week we’d been hearing these career nonpartisan diplomats coming in and pointing at Gordon Sondland. And here you have Gordon Sondland turning around just as quickly and pointing at the president and Rudy Giuliani and saying, everything I did, I did because they told me to. And I didn’t always feel good about it. I don’t think Rudy Giuliani should have been involved. I think the men and women of the State Department ought to be running our foreign policy, he testified. But I have to follow the directions of the president. And I thought, more or less, that I could work within those parameters to still achieve an end that I believed in, to still help Ukraine. And he said something interesting. He says, I didn’t realize at first. It was only later that I realized that Rudy Giuliani may have had some other motivations in mind. As if all of this is not enough, one of the president’s loyal diplomats seeming to turn on him and point the finger back at him.

michael barbaro Hello. michael shear How are you? michael barbaro Mr. Shear. michael shear Good to see you.

nicholas fandos

My colleague Mike Shear walks up.

michael barbaro I’m just going to say, any email that starts with, “This will be interesting,” I want to read the rest of. michael shear Mick Mulvaney is about to give a press briefing. nicholas fandos Oh, jeez.

nicholas fandos

And says, hey, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who never addresses the press, has just scheduled a 12:30 press conference at the White House. He’s going to talk to reporters. And we think he’s going to talk about Ukraine.

michael shear But, I mean, he should get a lot of questions about this stuff, about impeachment. I mean, he’s going to the White House press briefing room.

nicholas fandos

So Mike and I go back to a press room just outside the SCIF and set up shop around his computer, where we tune into this press conference.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

rachel quester (WHISPERING) What’s happening? michael barbaro We’re with Nick Fandos and Mike Shear watching Mulvaney.

nicholas fandos

He starts to field questions. And it gets crazy really fast.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.

nicholas fandos

After this week of slow drip disclosures, and after weeks of the White House denying that there had been any kind of leverage, or quid pro quo, or exchange with the Ukrainians around the suspension of security aid for the country, he comes out and basically says — he does say, on the record, that —

archived recording So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to the Ukraine? archived recording (mick mulvaney) The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. Then that is absolutely appropriate.

nicholas fandos

The White House withheld the aid for several reasons. And one of those reasons was President Trump wanted Ukraine to first commit to investigating potential collusion between Ukrainians and Democrats in the 2016 election that was meant to undermine his campaign. And on top of it, Mulvaney says, yep, this was the deal.

archived recording Let’s be clear. What you’ve just described is a quid pro quo.

nicholas fandos

Reporters quickly call it a quid pro quo.

archived recording It is — funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well. archived recording (mick mulvaney) We do that all the time with foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

And he said, that’s fine. It happens all the time. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) If you read the news reports, and you believe them — what did McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy, that was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody, get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.

michael barbaro

I mean, that’s an extraordinary thing for the White House chief of staff to say.

nicholas fandos

It is. And he goes a little bit further. He’s asked about Rudy Giuliani and his role. And his defense, again, is essentially that the president of the United States gets to dictate foreign policy. And if he wants his personal lawyer — a guy who he’s not paying, a guy who’s doing business, by the way, in Ukraine at the same time he’s evidently doing diplomacy — to run American foreign policy, well, that’s his prerogative. Elections have consequences. And that’s O.K. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Elections do have consequences. And they should. And your foreign policy is going to change. Obama did it in one way, we’re doing it in a different way. And there’s no problem with that.

nicholas fandos

It’s a pretty stunning assertion. A pretty stunning view of executive power. It suggests the White House has not been telling the whole truth up till today.

michael barbaro

And then decided to tell it in a kind of extreme, unexpected way.

nicholas fandos

Right. It’s a little baffling to understand what exactly Mick Mulvaney was doing here.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) I’m not going to take anymore. It’s nice to see everybody. Thanks again. nicholas fandos All right, so we should — we should get on the phone. mike shear What the hell just happened? michael barbaro Why don’t you take some time to figure out what this all means? nicholas fandos There’s also probably about to be a House vote, where we may need to go and see if we can’t get some quick reaction.

nicholas fandos

You know, it was pretty evident in the hour or so after that press conference that lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn’t quite know what to make of it either.

recording^

Today, the chief of staff said what we’ve always just talked about. It was also about exonerating Russia and looking at the 2016 election.

nicholas fandos

Some said, well, they just admitted to the whole thing, I suppose. So what do we do now? Others, Adam Schiff said —

archived recording (adam schiff) It certainly indicates that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.

nicholas fandos

A story that’s very, very bad just got much, much worse.

michael barbaro

Well, to the extent, Nick, that it’s knowable, what do you make of why the White House decided to do this? It’s kind of hard to understand.

nicholas fandos

It is. We don’t know if Mulvaney was acting on his own authority, who had put him out there. The president’s legal team, one of his other lawyers who’s not Rudy Giuliani, said he hadn’t been consulted before Mulvaney went out there. You know, there has been a move that President Trump returns to time and again in his presidency. And part of me wonders if this isn’t the same thing, where, when he’s being accused of something bad, of having done something under the table or that would be deemed inappropriate for others, instead of pretending he didn’t, he just kind of throws it all out into the open and says, you know, yeah, I did this. But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. So what? Tell me it’s wrong. And I think at the end of this week, one of the biggest questions that I think emerges from all this stuff is that it’s now up to Congress, not just Democrats, but Republicans, too, to answer that question and say, is this right, or is this wrong? If he’s going to own up to most of it, and assuming that more officials come forward and fill in different pieces of this story as we’re coming to understand it, you know, can they stomach that? And is that a transgression that they’re willing to say is worthy of impeachment and worthy of his removal from office? I mean, it’s kind of on the president’s part, potentially, the ultimate high-stakes bluff, and I don’t think we know yet where things are going to fall out.

[music]

nicholas fandos

I think what we’re left with at the end of this week is, like, a question. Is this a story of a bunch of career diplomats, who have never really much liked President Trump or his policies, rebelling against him? And I don’t think that they really see it that way. From their perspective, you know, they’re used to having policy differences with presidents of both parties. They’re trained to implement the policies of Republicans and of Democrats. What I think is different, what is leading otherwise anonymous officials to blow the whistle, to march up to Capitol Hill and walk down all those flights of steps to the House SCIF and tell the story as they see it, is that they see this as something fundamentally different, and, importantly, as a part of their responsibility as permanent agents of the government, of people who are working on behalf of the American people, not a particular president, and that only when things seem to get so bad did they decide they needed to speak up.

michael barbaro

Nick, thank you for essentially giving us your entire week. We appreciate it.

nicholas fandos

It was a pleasure to have the company.

michael barbaro

It can get lonely in front of a SCIF, I imagine. Anyway, thank you, truly.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, I’m glad you guys were here. It’s been quite a story.

michael barbaro

The rest — so on Thursday night, there was a huge bipartisan outcry, and the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, tries to walk back his comments about a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He issues a statement essentially denying what he has said just a few hours earlier. And I’m going to read you the quote. He said, “Let me be clear. There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.” We’ll be right back.

sheryl gay stolberg How does it sound? michael barbaro It sounds pretty good. sheryl gay stolberg Sound O.K.? michael barbaro I’ve never actually produced a bit of — any audio on my own. So this is a bit of an experiment. sheryl gay stolberg O.K., great. michael barbaro And I think this is definitely the first time we have done the headlines of “The Daily” inside the Senate press gallery. So Sheryl Stolberg — oh, I think, I’m supposed to hold this to my own mouth.

michael barbaro

So Sheryl, what do we need to know today?

sheryl gay stolberg

So it was a really busy news day.

archived recording (mike pence) Today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdogan in Turkey and the United States of America that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.

sheryl gay stolberg

Vice President Pence flew to Turkey, and on Thursday afternoon, he announced that Turkey had agreed to a cease-fire in which the Turkish government would suspend its military operations in northern Syria for five days in order to give the Kurds time to clear the area. So that raises the question, is this a breakthrough, or is this just giving Turkey what it wants in the first place, because they wanted the Kurds out?

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording Will you support this deal? What do you think of it? archived recording (jeremy corbyn) Well, from what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or our expectations.

sheryl gay stolberg

There’s finally a deal for Brexit that the European Union and Britain both think will work. But it’s not clear if it’s going to pass, because it has to go through Parliament, and the Labour Party has already said it’s opposed.

archived recording (jeremy corbyn) We are unhappy with this deal, and as it stands, we’ll vote against it.

sheryl gay stolberg

And finally, on Thursday, it was a sad day here in the Capitol, because Representative Elijah Cummings, a towering figure in the House, died. Cummings was a son of sharecroppers. His own presence here was really a miracle to him.

archived recording (elijah cummings) My father had never been in the Capitol building. He said, isn’t this the place where they used to call us slaves? I said, yes sir. And isn’t this the place they used to call us three-fifths of a man? I said, yes, sir. And isn’t this the place that they used to call us chattel? I say, yes, yes, yes, sir. And I’ll never forget, he said, when I think about you being sworn in today, he said, now I see what I could have been if I had had an opportunity.

sheryl gay stolberg

And over the last year, as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he had been a central figure in the investigations of the president, and in his role in these investigations, he continually pleaded for decency.

archived recording (elijah cummings) We are better than this. We are so much — we really are. As a country, we are so much better than this. And I’m hoping that all of us can get back to this democracy that we want and that we should be passing on to our children so that they can do better than what we did.

michael barbaro

Sheryl, thank you.

sheryl gay stolberg

Thank you, Michael.

clare toeniskoetter We’re walking out?

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

michael barbaro

Today —

speaker 1 Nothing further at this moment. speaker 2 Does this move the ball for impeachment, in your mind?

michael barbaro

A week inside the U.S. Capitol as the impeachment inquiry enters a pivotal phase. It’s Friday, October 18.

nicholas fandos There’s a bunch of rooms, so — michael barbaro O.K. clare toeniskoetter What’s going on? michael barbaro We’re just trying to find a room that is quiet enough to make an episode of “The Daily.” nicholas fandos I think this will work.

michael barbaro

O.K. Here we go. Nick Fandos, you’ve been on the Hill all week. Walk me through this. What does the impeachment inquiry actually look like on the ground?

nicholas fandos

Yeah. So, I mean, the crazy thing is that the house opened this impeachment inquiry a little more than three weeks ago now on their way out of town for a two-week recess. So members were scattered all over the country, meeting with constituents, holding town halls, while back here in the Capitol, a core group of staff members, basically, for the House Intelligence Committee and a couple of others, stuck around and began issuing subpoenas and requests, setting up the very first witness depositions for their investigation. And so this week was the week that five of those depositions, one a day, were lined up, and lawmakers were going to be coming back. So that’s kind of what I was expecting when I arrived at the Capitol on Monday.

rachel quester Hello. nicholas fandos Hey, it’s Nick. rachel quester Hi, how’s it going?

nicholas fandos

And I met up with our colleagues from “The Daily,” Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter, who were going to spend the week with me.

nicholas fandos It’s so nice outside. rachel quester It’s so nice outside.

nicholas fandos

We had to meet up outside of the Capitol because it was Columbus Day, actually. The press galleries and all the functional staff were not working here. So I had to escort them in specially. We walked inside and down three sets of stairs.

clare toeniskoetter Where are we? nicholas fandos We’re standing now beside the doors to the House Intelligence Committee SCIF.

nicholas fandos

And at the bottom of those stairs, we end up at the secured rooms, we call it the SCIF, of the House Intelligence Committee —

clare toeniskoetter Wait, SCIF? Secure — nicholas fandos Compartmentalized Information Facility.

nicholas fandos

— which is one of the most secretive in Congress. It’s where this investigation is taking place, all behind closed doors.

nicholas fandos And they have these red stickers on them, which get photographed all the time and are always in the newspaper, which just say “restricted area.” You can’t go there.

nicholas fandos

So the three of us and a bunch of reporters were gathered around outside, basically waiting for any emissaries to come out of the room and give some sense of what was going on back there with the very first witness deposition.

nicholas fandos We spend all day trying to mentally pierce that barrier.

michael barbaro

So it says something about this week that this room is where Congress is holding these hearings.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, that’s right. I mean, it’s entirely outside of the public view. This is an investigation that could result in an attempt to remove President Trump. And the earliest stages of the investigation, at least, are all being conducted out of public view. And this has been a source of some contention early on.

archived recording (jim jordan) The first two interviews, totalling approximately 20 hours, not one single thing was said in those respective interviews that the American people should not be able to see, should not be able to hear.

nicholas fandos

Republicans have really seized on it to accuse Democrats of, basically, trying to impeach Trump in private —

archived recording (jim jordan) The tragedy here, and the crime here, is that the American people don’t get to see what’s going on in these sessions.

nicholas fandos

— of hiding important work from the American people and from the press, who might be able to evaluate it. And the Democrats argue, though, that basically, this is investigative best practice. That, unlike past impeachments, they don’t already know what the story is. They need to find out the details. And the best way to investigate it is in private, where witnesses can’t line up their stories by hearing what somebody else testified, where lawyers can ask most of the questions, rather than lawmakers who are, maybe, trying to fundraise off of some quip, or speak to their constituents at a public hearing. And this allows them, ideally, to move quickly and collect a lot of information efficiently. And then, they figure out, what have we found? And what is the best of what we’ve got? And they move that, then, into the public sphere. And they present that evidence, they invite their best witnesses to come and testify, and they can kind of control the story that they’re building against the president.

michael barbaro

Much like a prosecutor, or a district attorney, quietly builds a case, makes an announcement of whether or not there’s an indictment, and then goes to trial.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. The rub, of course, is that this is Congress. And politicians love to blab. They get information that looks damaging to the president. If you’re a Democrat, you’d love for that to get out.

michael barbaro

So what’s the situation on Monday when it comes to these hearings? What’s actually happening in that SCIF, behind those closed doors?

nicholas fandos

So for most of the day Monday, all I know is that this former White House official, Fiona Hill, is in there testifying. And it’s hour after hour after hour. There’s very little information coming out. My feet are getting sore.

nicholas fandos Hey. Are you still free?

nicholas fandos

Chit-chatting with other reporters. Basically waiting for any kind of emissary to come out of the room and give us a sense of what’s going on.

nicholas fandos It seems pretty quiet. I think Schiff just left to go — he’s speaking at the 92nd Street Y.

michael barbaro

You’re just spending the day standing outside this room.

nicholas fandos

Right.

nicholas fandos [SIGHS] clare toeniskoetter How many hours do you think you’ve spent standing, waiting, doing nothing so far? nicholas fandos I don’t know. Probably north of 30 hours, 35 hours. But it’ll get worse.

nicholas fandos

And it was a long day. And, eventually, the sun goes down. Fiona Hill is still not done. And she finally leaves at about 8 o’clock.

clare toeniskoetter Bye, thank you!

nicholas fandos

I just kind of had to go home. Because there was not a whole lot more reporting to do here.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

nicholas fandos

And it was only as I was walking back up to my apartment building that I started hearing from some sources and being able to piece together, over the next couple of hours, what had actually happened that day. And the testimony, it turns out, was pretty remarkable.

michael barbaro

What was the testimony?

nicholas fandos

So you’ve got to keep in mind, Fiona Hill is a respected career Russia expert who was brought in to the Trump administration to work for John Bolton on the National Security Council as one of the president’s top advisers on Europe and Russia policy. So she’s right at the center of traditional decision making around policy towards Ukraine. And the account that she gives is that there was a meeting earlier this summer in July where several other diplomats, including Gordon Sondland, a former Trump donor who had become ambassador to the European Union, met with some Ukrainian officials. And she tells lawmakers that this meeting veered dangerously off course, from her perspective, and that she and her boss, John Bolton, were so alarmed by what was said that Bolton told her, you need to go to White House lawyers right now and tell them that we’re not part of, and this was a quote, “whatever drug deal” these guys are cooking up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

Not a literal drug deal. But what Bolton and Hill thought was going on is that Sondland and the president’s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were basically holding out from the Ukrainians a White House meeting with President Trump, which is what they wanted, as leverage for the Ukrainians agreeing to investigate Democrats and Democratic issues that could benefit the president politically. Hill also testified that, at one point, Bolton referred to Giuliani as a “hand grenade” that’s “going to blow everybody up.” And so we were able to basically pull together this and some other elements of the story and publish it, I think, about 10:30 at night, and really be able to tell the story of day one behind those closed doors.

michael barbaro

So beyond this being a very juicy scoop, what’s the significance of the testimony that Fiona Hill gave? What does it do for the inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So there are a couple things that I would say. One is that she implicates her boss, John Bolton, who is a boldface name in Washington. He’s the president’s top national security adviser. And saying that high up in the chain, the president’s national security adviser is calling this a “drug deal,” was so concerned about this he had me go to the lawyers — and it kind of opened the door to the fact that this set of events that we’re learning about in retrospect were setting off alarms in real time, and at very high levels of the government. The other aspect of it, though, is that I’m looking ahead to the rest of the week, and it seems pretty clear she’s not going to be the last person. Unlike in past investigations, where the White House has successfully shut down Congress, important witnesses are coming, and they’re going to talk, and they’re going to tell their story. We’re actually going to understand what happened here.

michael barbaro

Nick, I guess I just have, like, a collegial inquiry here. What’s the point of standing around all day if you end up getting the best stuff when you get home at, like, 10 o’clock at night?

nicholas fandos

[LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Doesn’t that suggest that maybe you’re not going about this in the most efficient way?

nicholas fandos

Uhh, it’s a fair point. But we do learn some pretty significant details that set the stage for the rest of the week.

michael barbaro

O.K. So what happens the next day, on Tuesday?

rachel quester Ready for day two. clare toeniskoetter Yeah.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday, we know that there is going to be another one of these closed-door depositions that’s probably going to go on again for hours, this time with a senior State Department official who was more or less in charge of Ukraine policy for the State Department.

speaker 1 So Julie’s group, we’re going to gather up. Make sure we have everybody. I don’t see Brian. speaker 2 I don’t either.

nicholas fandos

But the first thing that I notice as I arrive at the Capitol is that the place has been transformed overnight.

rachel quester O.K., so Nick just walked away, because he got a call from a member of Congress.

nicholas fandos

After two weeks of recess, lawmakers are back.

speaker Madam Speaker, will there be an formal vote on an impeachment inquiry? Madam Speaker?

nicholas fandos

There are even tourists wandering around through the SCIF area, running into reporters.

speaker 1 In part to keep an eye on the British. speaker 2 Yeah, it’s somewhere up there. Oh, wait. There we go.

nicholas fandos

Stopping, looking at the TV reporters, who they recognize from CNN.

speaker 1 Have you guys heard of the whole impeachment inquiry? speaker 2 Mm-hmm. speaker 3 Yeah. That’s craziness.

nicholas fandos

The press corps seems to have somehow doubled. I don’t know how, because it’s already been huge following this stuff. And there’s just kind of an energy gripping the place that comes with 535 or so lawmakers and their staff, their kind of entourages, being back, moving around the Capitol.

michael barbaro

Can any member of Congress walk into the SCIF, right by you, and actually listen to these depositions as testimony?

nicholas fandos

The answer is no. And we actually saw it a couple times this week, when Republicans tried to go in and sit in on these depositions. But they were not on the committees that are leading the investigation. And therefore, under the committee rules, they ended up getting kicked out. But with lawmakers back in town, you’re talking about three committees that are leading the impeachment investigation. That’s dozens and dozens of lawmakers that sit on those. And they can all go and sit in. And they can come out, and they’re not supposed to talk in detail about what transpired, but they can give general impressions and hints about what they heard. In one case, one Democrat came out and basically broke the rules and just talked about what was happening completely.

archived recording How did the questioning go today, Gerry? archived recording (gerry connolly) I thought it was very powerful testimony.

michael barbaro

And what did this Democrat divulge?

nicholas fandos

So he comes out and says —

archived recording (gerry connolly) Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine —

nicholas fandos

— that he’d just heard the witness in the room, a State Department official named George Kent —

archived recording (gerry connolly) — who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine.

nicholas fandos

— that he and other career diplomats who were in charge of the State Department’s policy toward Ukraine had been shoved aside —

archived recording (gerry connolly) All of the people charged with policy in Ukraine were replaced, apparently, after a May 23rd meeting at the White House organized by Mick Mulvaney, not John Bolton or Pompeo.

nicholas fandos

— and were told, starting late in the spring, that basically, their services weren’t needed anymore —

archived recording (gerry connolly) And that was wrong. He used that word, “wrong.”

nicholas fandos

— that policy towards Ukraine was going to be run by Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, and others out of the White House —

archived recording (gerry connolly) The import of this testimony is deeply disturbing, especially the role of Rudy Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

— and they may as well lay low.

michael barbaro

And what’s the significance of that?

nicholas fandos

So the significance of that is that you have here another high-level American diplomat saying that the normal channels for foreign policy that have guided American policy for quite a long time are being stepped on, basically, by the White House, which is putting their own guys in charge. And one of them that he singles out, yet again, is Gordon Sondland. Now you have a second witness, two in two days, coming forward and giving a pretty consistent account. This is all picking up a little bit of momentum.

michael barbaro

So I’m taking it you didn’t watch the Democratic debate.

nicholas fandos

I did not watch the Democratic debate, and I did not watch playoff baseball.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

nicholas fandos

What if we take a 20-minute break, and I can go and satisfy my editors a little bit by updating some stories?

michael barbaro

Yeah. All right. We’ll be back, as we say.

nicholas fandos

O.K. More soon.

clare toeniskoetter Thanks, Nick. nicholas fandos You guys going to hang here? michael barbaro Yeah. rachel quester O.K. Should we go to break there?

michael barbaro

That was the idea.

clare toeniskoetter See ya!

michael barbaro

O.K. So Wednesday.

nicholas fandos

Wednesday. Another day, another diplomat. This time, it’s a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who quit the State Department last week, reportedly because he was so frustrated by the very things that we’re talking about. He tried to raise alarms by that and didn’t get a response. And he was so fed up, he said he quit. So it’s clear after three days of testimony that we’re starting to see the diplomatic and foreign policy core, the expertise, the professional class that handles American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican administrations, basically coming one by one to tell a remarkably consistent story about how, in ways that they were uncomfortable with and they had not seen before, they were getting pushed aside. And the policy that was being executed in their place — they would say it’s not even a policy — but the actions in their place, basically, rather than, to put it in their words, the policy serving the well-being of the Ukrainians and the United States, it was serving the well-being of the president of the United States. And that was about it.

michael barbaro

But how exactly is that the basis of an impeachment inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not the fact that they were pushed aside that they see as so problematic. They’re telling a story about what happened once they were pushed aside. They think that’s created a set of conditions that led to these events that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. And that’s really what investigators are trying to get to the bottom of. And now, they’ve been able to establish how the circumstances, or the scene, was set for those things to happen by these current and former diplomats. But they still have more investigative work to flesh that out. ^CLARE TOENISKOETTER^ O.K., we’re walking up.

speaker All right. So I’m going to just watch for — nicholas fandos If that’s O.K. speaker Yeah, yeah.

nicholas fandos

So in the middle of all this on Wednesday, I meet up with my colleague, Sheryl Stolberg.

nicholas fandos Yeah, we’ll probably go to one of those tables. sheryl gay stolberg You think it’ll be a standing interview? nicholas fandos I hope not. But, you know, a guy’s got to get his steps in.

nicholas fandos

And we’re going to go upstairs into the Capitol to interview Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who chairs the Intelligence Committee and is the man at the center of all these hearings leading the impeachment investigation. We had been hoping to sit down with Schiff in his office and have a kind of quieter, more reflective meeting. But indicative of the way things are in the middle of this inquiry, his staff asked, instead, if we could meet in a reception room.

sheryl gay stolberg Let’s take this corner.

nicholas fandos

Right off the floor of the Capitol, where there were different meet-and-greets going on, and constituents were meeting with their members of Congress. And the room was buzzing and lively. And we staked out a corner where we could talk to Congressman Schiff.

adam schiff How are you doing? nicholas fandos How are you? adam schiff Good. nicholas fandos Here, and Sheryl’s over here too. sheryl gay stolberg Hi! adam schiff Hi, how are you?

nicholas fandos

And we were able to put to him some, kind of, key questions about what we thought was going on to see how he sees it.

sheryl gay stolberg You know, the president talks a lot about the deep state. Does it strike you that this is exactly what he fears, or what he thinks of as the deep state? adam schiff You know, the deep state theory used to be a fringe theory in third-world countries or kooky conspiracy theorists at home. When the president talks about the deep state, what he’s really talking about is, in particular, people that expose his wrongdoing and misconduct.

nicholas fandos

At one point, we put the question to him of what he made of all these diplomats coming forward and telling this story.

adam schiff You know, there’s no revolt, and there’s no deep state. sheryl gay stolberg I’m being —

nicholas fandos

He quibbled a little bit with the wording that Sheryl used. But he basically said, I agree with the premise of the question.

adam schiff I think it’s a very serious attack on career public servants who are unwilling to compromise themselves in the president’s service. This has to be the last question because I’ve got to go vote on the last vote. sheryl gay stolberg I have two more real quickies. Do you have enough evidence to impeach? adam schiff I’ve got to go vote. sheryl gay stolberg Can he come back or is that it? nicholas fandos I can ask.

michael barbaro

So another busy day. Where is your head as Wednesday comes to an end?

nicholas fandos

So by the end of Wednesday, it just feels inescapable that this is all building, at least this week, towards Gordon Sondland coming in himself on Thursday and giving his account of what happened, of facing questions about these various accusations and accounts that investigators have been getting all week. And figuring out, how does he explain this stuff? How does he view what was going on? And we left the Capitol Wednesday evening waiting to see exactly what he was going to say.

michael barbaro

Right. Like, if this is a play, the character that everyone’s been talking about for the last 90 minutes eventually has to come onstage and say something.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Except for, in this case, the stage is behind closed doors. And saying something, it turns out, amounts to releasing an 18-page opening statement Thursday morning right before he begins to answer questions.

nicholas fandos Hello. michael barbaro Hi. nicholas fandos Welcome. michael barbaro Very nice to see you. nicholas fandos Very nice to see you.

michael barbaro

So that’s how Thursday morning begins. I walk into the Capitol with Rachel and Clare just as, it seems, you are digesting Gordon Sondland’s opening statements.

nicholas fandos And my morning was basically spent trying to go through 18 pages of what he was going to go in there and say.

nicholas fandos

We received a copy of his opening statement. And Mike Schmidt, our colleague, and I pored through it to try and figure out, what’s new here? What’s he addressing? What does he have to say? And a couple of things jumped out at us. He basically says, in a meeting that he had with President Trump in May, not long after the new Ukrainian president is elected, President Trump basically rejected Sondland’s advice and the advice of other diplomats that were with him who said, you know, Mr. President, we think you ought to meet with this new guy. We think he’s going to do good work. Trump didn’t seem interested, and then directed them, Sondland said, to go through Rudy Giuliani, to go through his private lawyer.

michael barbaro

On Ukraine foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

He gave Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, and other high-ranking officials in the room the direct impression that he had empowered Rudy Giuliani to basically run American policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

I mean, all week we’d been hearing these career nonpartisan diplomats coming in and pointing at Gordon Sondland. And here you have Gordon Sondland turning around just as quickly and pointing at the president and Rudy Giuliani and saying, everything I did, I did because they told me to. And I didn’t always feel good about it. I don’t think Rudy Giuliani should have been involved. I think the men and women of the State Department ought to be running our foreign policy, he testified. But I have to follow the directions of the president. And I thought, more or less, that I could work within those parameters to still achieve an end that I believed in, to still help Ukraine. And he said something interesting. He says, I didn’t realize at first. It was only later that I realized that Rudy Giuliani may have had some other motivations in mind. As if all of this is not enough, one of the president’s loyal diplomats seeming to turn on him and point the finger back at him.

michael barbaro Hello. michael shear How are you? michael barbaro Mr. Shear. michael shear Good to see you.

nicholas fandos

My colleague Mike Shear walks up.

michael barbaro I’m just going to say, any email that starts with, “This will be interesting,” I want to read the rest of. michael shear Mick Mulvaney is about to give a press briefing. nicholas fandos Oh, jeez.

nicholas fandos

And says, hey, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who never addresses the press, has just scheduled a 12:30 press conference at the White House. He’s going to talk to reporters. And we think he’s going to talk about Ukraine.

michael shear But, I mean, he should get a lot of questions about this stuff, about impeachment. I mean, he’s going to the White House press briefing room.

nicholas fandos

So Mike and I go back to a press room just outside the SCIF and set up shop around his computer, where we tune into this press conference.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

rachel quester (WHISPERING) What’s happening? michael barbaro We’re with Nick Fandos and Mike Shear watching Mulvaney.

nicholas fandos

He starts to field questions. And it gets crazy really fast.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.

nicholas fandos

After this week of slow drip disclosures, and after weeks of the White House denying that there had been any kind of leverage, or quid pro quo, or exchange with the Ukrainians around the suspension of security aid for the country, he comes out and basically says — he does say, on the record, that —

archived recording So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to the Ukraine? archived recording (mick mulvaney) The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. Then that is absolutely appropriate.

nicholas fandos

The White House withheld the aid for several reasons. And one of those reasons was President Trump wanted Ukraine to first commit to investigating potential collusion between Ukrainians and Democrats in the 2016 election that was meant to undermine his campaign. And on top of it, Mulvaney says, yep, this was the deal.

archived recording Let’s be clear. What you’ve just described is a quid pro quo.

nicholas fandos

Reporters quickly call it a quid pro quo.

archived recording It is — funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well. archived recording (mick mulvaney) We do that all the time with foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

And he said, that’s fine. It happens all the time. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) If you read the news reports, and you believe them — what did McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy, that was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody, get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.

michael barbaro

I mean, that’s an extraordinary thing for the White House chief of staff to say.

nicholas fandos

It is. And he goes a little bit further. He’s asked about Rudy Giuliani and his role. And his defense, again, is essentially that the president of the United States gets to dictate foreign policy. And if he wants his personal lawyer — a guy who he’s not paying, a guy who’s doing business, by the way, in Ukraine at the same time he’s evidently doing diplomacy — to run American foreign policy, well, that’s his prerogative. Elections have consequences. And that’s O.K. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Elections do have consequences. And they should. And your foreign policy is going to change. Obama did it in one way, we’re doing it in a different way. And there’s no problem with that.

nicholas fandos

It’s a pretty stunning assertion. A pretty stunning view of executive power. It suggests the White House has not been telling the whole truth up till today.

michael barbaro

And then decided to tell it in a kind of extreme, unexpected way.

nicholas fandos

Right. It’s a little baffling to understand what exactly Mick Mulvaney was doing here.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) I’m not going to take anymore. It’s nice to see everybody. Thanks again. nicholas fandos All right, so we should — we should get on the phone. mike shear What the hell just happened? michael barbaro Why don’t you take some time to figure out what this all means? nicholas fandos There’s also probably about to be a House vote, where we may need to go and see if we can’t get some quick reaction.

nicholas fandos

You know, it was pretty evident in the hour or so after that press conference that lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn’t quite know what to make of it either.

recording^

Today, the chief of staff said what we’ve always just talked about. It was also about exonerating Russia and looking at the 2016 election.

nicholas fandos

Some said, well, they just admitted to the whole thing, I suppose. So what do we do now? Others, Adam Schiff said —

archived recording (adam schiff) It certainly indicates that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.

nicholas fandos

A story that’s very, very bad just got much, much worse.

michael barbaro

Well, to the extent, Nick, that it’s knowable, what do you make of why the White House decided to do this? It’s kind of hard to understand.

nicholas fandos

It is. We don’t know if Mulvaney was acting on his own authority, who had put him out there. The president’s legal team, one of his other lawyers who’s not Rudy Giuliani, said he hadn’t been consulted before Mulvaney went out there. You know, there has been a move that President Trump returns to time and again in his presidency. And part of me wonders if this isn’t the same thing, where, when he’s being accused of something bad, of having done something under the table or that would be deemed inappropriate for others, instead of pretending he didn’t, he just kind of throws it all out into the open and says, you know, yeah, I did this. But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. So what? Tell me it’s wrong. And I think at the end of this week, one of the biggest questions that I think emerges from all this stuff is that it’s now up to Congress, not just Democrats, but Republicans, too, to answer that question and say, is this right, or is this wrong? If he’s going to own up to most of it, and assuming that more officials come forward and fill in different pieces of this story as we’re coming to understand it, you know, can they stomach that? And is that a transgression that they’re willing to say is worthy of impeachment and worthy of his removal from office? I mean, it’s kind of on the president’s part, potentially, the ultimate high-stakes bluff, and I don’t think we know yet where things are going to fall out.

[music]

nicholas fandos

I think what we’re left with at the end of this week is, like, a question. Is this a story of a bunch of career diplomats, who have never really much liked President Trump or his policies, rebelling against him? And I don’t think that they really see it that way. From their perspective, you know, they’re used to having policy differences with presidents of both parties. They’re trained to implement the policies of Republicans and of Democrats. What I think is different, what is leading otherwise anonymous officials to blow the whistle, to march up to Capitol Hill and walk down all those flights of steps to the House SCIF and tell the story as they see it, is that they see this as something fundamentally different, and, importantly, as a part of their responsibility as permanent agents of the government, of people who are working on behalf of the American people, not a particular president, and that only when things seem to get so bad did they decide they needed to speak up.

michael barbaro

Nick, thank you for essentially giving us your entire week. We appreciate it.

nicholas fandos

It was a pleasure to have the company.

michael barbaro

It can get lonely in front of a SCIF, I imagine. Anyway, thank you, truly.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, I’m glad you guys were here. It’s been quite a story.

michael barbaro

The rest — so on Thursday night, there was a huge bipartisan outcry, and the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, tries to walk back his comments about a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He issues a statement essentially denying what he has said just a few hours earlier. And I’m going to read you the quote. He said, “Let me be clear. There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.” We’ll be right back.

sheryl gay stolberg How does it sound? michael barbaro It sounds pretty good. sheryl gay stolberg Sound O.K.? michael barbaro I’ve never actually produced a bit of — any audio on my own. So this is a bit of an experiment. sheryl gay stolberg O.K., great. michael barbaro And I think this is definitely the first time we have done the headlines of “The Daily” inside the Senate press gallery. So Sheryl Stolberg — oh, I think, I’m supposed to hold this to my own mouth.

michael barbaro

So Sheryl, what do we need to know today?

sheryl gay stolberg

So it was a really busy news day.

archived recording (mike pence) Today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdogan in Turkey and the United States of America that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.

sheryl gay stolberg

Vice President Pence flew to Turkey, and on Thursday afternoon, he announced that Turkey had agreed to a cease-fire in which the Turkish government would suspend its military operations in northern Syria for five days in order to give the Kurds time to clear the area. So that raises the question, is this a breakthrough, or is this just giving Turkey what it wants in the first place, because they wanted the Kurds out?

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording Will you support this deal? What do you think of it? archived recording (jeremy corbyn) Well, from what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or our expectations.

sheryl gay stolberg

There’s finally a deal for Brexit that the European Union and Britain both think will work. But it’s not clear if it’s going to pass, because it has to go through Parliament, and the Labour Party has already said it’s opposed.

archived recording (jeremy corbyn) We are unhappy with this deal, and as it stands, we’ll vote against it.

sheryl gay stolberg

And finally, on Thursday, it was a sad day here in the Capitol, because Representative Elijah Cummings, a towering figure in the House, died. Cummings was a son of sharecroppers. His own presence here was really a miracle to him.

archived recording (elijah cummings) My father had never been in the Capitol building. He said, isn’t this the place where they used to call us slaves? I said, yes sir. And isn’t this the place they used to call us three-fifths of a man? I said, yes, sir. And isn’t this the place that they used to call us chattel? I say, yes, yes, yes, sir. And I’ll never forget, he said, when I think about you being sworn in today, he said, now I see what I could have been if I had had an opportunity.

sheryl gay stolberg

And over the last year, as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he had been a central figure in the investigations of the president, and in his role in these investigations, he continually pleaded for decency.

archived recording (elijah cummings) We are better than this. We are so much — we really are. As a country, we are so much better than this. And I’m hoping that all of us can get back to this democracy that we want and that we should be passing on to our children so that they can do better than what we did.

michael barbaro

Sheryl, thank you.

sheryl gay stolberg

Thank you, Michael.

michael barbaro

Today —

speaker 1 Nothing further at this moment. speaker 2 Does this move the ball for impeachment, in your mind?

michael barbaro

A week inside the U.S. Capitol as the impeachment inquiry enters a pivotal phase. It’s Friday, October 18.

nicholas fandos There’s a bunch of rooms, so — michael barbaro O.K. clare toeniskoetter What’s going on? michael barbaro We’re just trying to find a room that is quiet enough to make an episode of “The Daily.” nicholas fandos I think this will work.

michael barbaro

O.K. Here we go. Nick Fandos, you’ve been on the Hill all week. Walk me through this. What does the impeachment inquiry actually look like on the ground?

nicholas fandos

Yeah. So, I mean, the crazy thing is that the house opened this impeachment inquiry a little more than three weeks ago now on their way out of town for a two-week recess. So members were scattered all over the country, meeting with constituents, holding town halls, while back here in the Capitol, a core group of staff members, basically, for the House Intelligence Committee and a couple of others, stuck around and began issuing subpoenas and requests, setting up the very first witness depositions for their investigation. And so this week was the week that five of those depositions, one a day, were lined up, and lawmakers were going to be coming back. So that’s kind of what I was expecting when I arrived at the Capitol on Monday.

rachel quester Hello. nicholas fandos Hey, it’s Nick. rachel quester Hi, how’s it going?

nicholas fandos

And I met up with our colleagues from “The Daily,” Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter, who were going to spend the week with me.

nicholas fandos It’s so nice outside. rachel quester It’s so nice outside.

nicholas fandos

We had to meet up outside of the Capitol because it was Columbus Day, actually. The press galleries and all the functional staff were not working here. So I had to escort them in specially. We walked inside and down three sets of stairs.

clare toeniskoetter Where are we? nicholas fandos We’re standing now beside the doors to the House Intelligence Committee SCIF.

nicholas fandos

And at the bottom of those stairs, we end up at the secured rooms, we call it the SCIF, of the House Intelligence Committee —

clare toeniskoetter Wait, SCIF? Secure — nicholas fandos Compartmentalized Information Facility.

nicholas fandos

— which is one of the most secretive in Congress. It’s where this investigation is taking place, all behind closed doors.

nicholas fandos And they have these red stickers on them, which get photographed all the time and are always in the newspaper, which just say “restricted area.” You can’t go there.

nicholas fandos

So the three of us and a bunch of reporters were gathered around outside, basically waiting for any emissaries to come out of the room and give some sense of what was going on back there with the very first witness deposition.

nicholas fandos We spend all day trying to mentally pierce that barrier.

michael barbaro

So it says something about this week that this room is where Congress is holding these hearings.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, that’s right. I mean, it’s entirely outside of the public view. This is an investigation that could result in an attempt to remove President Trump. And the earliest stages of the investigation, at least, are all being conducted out of public view. And this has been a source of some contention early on.

archived recording (jim jordan) The first two interviews, totalling approximately 20 hours, not one single thing was said in those respective interviews that the American people should not be able to see, should not be able to hear.

nicholas fandos

Republicans have really seized on it to accuse Democrats of, basically, trying to impeach Trump in private —

archived recording (jim jordan) The tragedy here, and the crime here, is that the American people don’t get to see what’s going on in these sessions.

nicholas fandos

— of hiding important work from the American people and from the press, who might be able to evaluate it. And the Democrats argue, though, that basically, this is investigative best practice. That, unlike past impeachments, they don’t already know what the story is. They need to find out the details. And the best way to investigate it is in private, where witnesses can’t line up their stories by hearing what somebody else testified, where lawyers can ask most of the questions, rather than lawmakers who are, maybe, trying to fundraise off of some quip, or speak to their constituents at a public hearing. And this allows them, ideally, to move quickly and collect a lot of information efficiently. And then, they figure out, what have we found? And what is the best of what we’ve got? And they move that, then, into the public sphere. And they present that evidence, they invite their best witnesses to come and testify, and they can kind of control the story that they’re building against the president.

michael barbaro

Much like a prosecutor, or a district attorney, quietly builds a case, makes an announcement of whether or not there’s an indictment, and then goes to trial.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. The rub, of course, is that this is Congress. And politicians love to blab. They get information that looks damaging to the president. If you’re a Democrat, you’d love for that to get out.

michael barbaro

So what’s the situation on Monday when it comes to these hearings? What’s actually happening in that SCIF, behind those closed doors?

nicholas fandos

So for most of the day Monday, all I know is that this former White House official, Fiona Hill, is in there testifying. And it’s hour after hour after hour. There’s very little information coming out. My feet are getting sore.

nicholas fandos Hey. Are you still free?

nicholas fandos

Chit-chatting with other reporters. Basically waiting for any kind of emissary to come out of the room and give us a sense of what’s going on.

nicholas fandos It seems pretty quiet. I think Schiff just left to go — he’s speaking at the 92nd Street Y.

michael barbaro

You’re just spending the day standing outside this room.

nicholas fandos

Right.

nicholas fandos [SIGHS] clare toeniskoetter How many hours do you think you’ve spent standing, waiting, doing nothing so far? nicholas fandos I don’t know. Probably north of 30 hours, 35 hours. But it’ll get worse.

nicholas fandos

And it was a long day. And, eventually, the sun goes down. Fiona Hill is still not done. And she finally leaves at about 8 o’clock.

clare toeniskoetter Bye, thank you!

nicholas fandos

I just kind of had to go home. Because there was not a whole lot more reporting to do here.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

nicholas fandos

And it was only as I was walking back up to my apartment building that I started hearing from some sources and being able to piece together, over the next couple of hours, what had actually happened that day. And the testimony, it turns out, was pretty remarkable.

michael barbaro

What was the testimony?

nicholas fandos

So you’ve got to keep in mind, Fiona Hill is a respected career Russia expert who was brought in to the Trump administration to work for John Bolton on the National Security Council as one of the president’s top advisers on Europe and Russia policy. So she’s right at the center of traditional decision making around policy towards Ukraine. And the account that she gives is that there was a meeting earlier this summer in July where several other diplomats, including Gordon Sondland, a former Trump donor who had become ambassador to the European Union, met with some Ukrainian officials. And she tells lawmakers that this meeting veered dangerously off course, from her perspective, and that she and her boss, John Bolton, were so alarmed by what was said that Bolton told her, you need to go to White House lawyers right now and tell them that we’re not part of, and this was a quote, “whatever drug deal” these guys are cooking up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

Not a literal drug deal. But what Bolton and Hill thought was going on is that Sondland and the president’s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were basically holding out from the Ukrainians a White House meeting with President Trump, which is what they wanted, as leverage for the Ukrainians agreeing to investigate Democrats and Democratic issues that could benefit the president politically. Hill also testified that, at one point, Bolton referred to Giuliani as a “hand grenade” that’s “going to blow everybody up.” And so we were able to basically pull together this and some other elements of the story and publish it, I think, about 10:30 at night, and really be able to tell the story of day one behind those closed doors.

michael barbaro

So beyond this being a very juicy scoop, what’s the significance of the testimony that Fiona Hill gave? What does it do for the inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So there are a couple things that I would say. One is that she implicates her boss, John Bolton, who is a boldface name in Washington. He’s the president’s top national security adviser. And saying that high up in the chain, the president’s national security adviser is calling this a “drug deal,” was so concerned about this he had me go to the lawyers — and it kind of opened the door to the fact that this set of events that we’re learning about in retrospect were setting off alarms in real time, and at very high levels of the government. The other aspect of it, though, is that I’m looking ahead to the rest of the week, and it seems pretty clear she’s not going to be the last person. Unlike in past investigations, where the White House has successfully shut down Congress, important witnesses are coming, and they’re going to talk, and they’re going to tell their story. We’re actually going to understand what happened here.

michael barbaro

Nick, I guess I just have, like, a collegial inquiry here. What’s the point of standing around all day if you end up getting the best stuff when you get home at, like, 10 o’clock at night?

nicholas fandos

[LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Doesn’t that suggest that maybe you’re not going about this in the most efficient way?

nicholas fandos

Uhh, it’s a fair point. But we do learn some pretty significant details that set the stage for the rest of the week.

michael barbaro

O.K. So what happens the next day, on Tuesday?

rachel quester Ready for day two. clare toeniskoetter Yeah.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday, we know that there is going to be another one of these closed-door depositions that’s probably going to go on again for hours, this time with a senior State Department official who was more or less in charge of Ukraine policy for the State Department.

speaker 1 So Julie’s group, we’re going to gather up. Make sure we have everybody. I don’t see Brian. speaker 2 I don’t either.

nicholas fandos

But the first thing that I notice as I arrive at the Capitol is that the place has been transformed overnight.

rachel quester O.K., so Nick just walked away, because he got a call from a member of Congress.

nicholas fandos

After two weeks of recess, lawmakers are back.

speaker Madam Speaker, will there be an formal vote on an impeachment inquiry? Madam Speaker?

nicholas fandos

There are even tourists wandering around through the SCIF area, running into reporters.

speaker 1 In part to keep an eye on the British. speaker 2 Yeah, it’s somewhere up there. Oh, wait. There we go.

nicholas fandos

Stopping, looking at the TV reporters, who they recognize from CNN.

speaker 1 Have you guys heard of the whole impeachment inquiry? speaker 2 Mm-hmm. speaker 3 Yeah. That’s craziness.

nicholas fandos

The press corps seems to have somehow doubled. I don’t know how, because it’s already been huge following this stuff. And there’s just kind of an energy gripping the place that comes with 535 or so lawmakers and their staff, their kind of entourages, being back, moving around the Capitol.

michael barbaro

Can any member of Congress walk into the SCIF, right by you, and actually listen to these depositions as testimony?

nicholas fandos

The answer is no. And we actually saw it a couple times this week, when Republicans tried to go in and sit in on these depositions. But they were not on the committees that are leading the investigation. And therefore, under the committee rules, they ended up getting kicked out. But with lawmakers back in town, you’re talking about three committees that are leading the impeachment investigation. That’s dozens and dozens of lawmakers that sit on those. And they can all go and sit in. And they can come out, and they’re not supposed to talk in detail about what transpired, but they can give general impressions and hints about what they heard. In one case, one Democrat came out and basically broke the rules and just talked about what was happening completely.

archived recording How did the questioning go today, Gerry? archived recording (gerry connolly) I thought it was very powerful testimony.

michael barbaro

And what did this Democrat divulge?

nicholas fandos

So he comes out and says —

archived recording (gerry connolly) Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine —

nicholas fandos

— that he’d just heard the witness in the room, a State Department official named George Kent —

archived recording (gerry connolly) — who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine.

nicholas fandos

— that he and other career diplomats who were in charge of the State Department’s policy toward Ukraine had been shoved aside —

archived recording (gerry connolly) All of the people charged with policy in Ukraine were replaced, apparently, after a May 23rd meeting at the White House organized by Mick Mulvaney, not John Bolton or Pompeo.

nicholas fandos

— and were told, starting late in the spring, that basically, their services weren’t needed anymore —

archived recording (gerry connolly) And that was wrong. He used that word, “wrong.”

nicholas fandos

— that policy towards Ukraine was going to be run by Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, and others out of the White House —

archived recording (gerry connolly) The import of this testimony is deeply disturbing, especially the role of Rudy Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

— and they may as well lay low.

michael barbaro

And what’s the significance of that?

nicholas fandos

So the significance of that is that you have here another high-level American diplomat saying that the normal channels for foreign policy that have guided American policy for quite a long time are being stepped on, basically, by the White House, which is putting their own guys in charge. And one of them that he singles out, yet again, is Gordon Sondland. Now you have a second witness, two in two days, coming forward and giving a pretty consistent account. This is all picking up a little bit of momentum.

michael barbaro

So I’m taking it you didn’t watch the Democratic debate.

nicholas fandos

I did not watch the Democratic debate, and I did not watch playoff baseball.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

nicholas fandos

What if we take a 20-minute break, and I can go and satisfy my editors a little bit by updating some stories?

michael barbaro

Yeah. All right. We’ll be back, as we say.

nicholas fandos

O.K. More soon.

clare toeniskoetter Thanks, Nick. nicholas fandos You guys going to hang here? michael barbaro Yeah. rachel quester O.K. Should we go to break there?

michael barbaro

That was the idea.

clare toeniskoetter See ya!

michael barbaro

O.K. So Wednesday.

nicholas fandos

Wednesday. Another day, another diplomat. This time, it’s a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who quit the State Department last week, reportedly because he was so frustrated by the very things that we’re talking about. He tried to raise alarms by that and didn’t get a response. And he was so fed up, he said he quit. So it’s clear after three days of testimony that we’re starting to see the diplomatic and foreign policy core, the expertise, the professional class that handles American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican administrations, basically coming one by one to tell a remarkably consistent story about how, in ways that they were uncomfortable with and they had not seen before, they were getting pushed aside. And the policy that was being executed in their place — they would say it’s not even a policy — but the actions in their place, basically, rather than, to put it in their words, the policy serving the well-being of the Ukrainians and the United States, it was serving the well-being of the president of the United States. And that was about it.

michael barbaro

But how exactly is that the basis of an impeachment inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not the fact that they were pushed aside that they see as so problematic. They’re telling a story about what happened once they were pushed aside. They think that’s created a set of conditions that led to these events that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. And that’s really what investigators are trying to get to the bottom of. And now, they’ve been able to establish how the circumstances, or the scene, was set for those things to happen by these current and former diplomats. But they still have more investigative work to flesh that out. ^CLARE TOENISKOETTER^ O.K., we’re walking up.

speaker All right. So I’m going to just watch for — nicholas fandos If that’s O.K. speaker Yeah, yeah.

nicholas fandos

So in the middle of all this on Wednesday, I meet up with my colleague, Sheryl Stolberg.

nicholas fandos Yeah, we’ll probably go to one of those tables. sheryl gay stolberg You think it’ll be a standing interview? nicholas fandos I hope not. But, you know, a guy’s got to get his steps in.

nicholas fandos

And we’re going to go upstairs into the Capitol to interview Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who chairs the Intelligence Committee and is the man at the center of all these hearings leading the impeachment investigation. We had been hoping to sit down with Schiff in his office and have a kind of quieter, more reflective meeting. But indicative of the way things are in the middle of this inquiry, his staff asked, instead, if we could meet in a reception room.

sheryl gay stolberg Let’s take this corner.

nicholas fandos

Right off the floor of the Capitol, where there were different meet-and-greets going on, and constituents were meeting with their members of Congress. And the room was buzzing and lively. And we staked out a corner where we could talk to Congressman Schiff.

adam schiff How are you doing? nicholas fandos How are you? adam schiff Good. nicholas fandos Here, and Sheryl’s over here too. sheryl gay stolberg Hi! adam schiff Hi, how are you?

nicholas fandos

And we were able to put to him some, kind of, key questions about what we thought was going on to see how he sees it.

sheryl gay stolberg You know, the president talks a lot about the deep state. Does it strike you that this is exactly what he fears, or what he thinks of as the deep state? adam schiff You know, the deep state theory used to be a fringe theory in third-world countries or kooky conspiracy theorists at home. When the president talks about the deep state, what he’s really talking about is, in particular, people that expose his wrongdoing and misconduct.

nicholas fandos

At one point, we put the question to him of what he made of all these diplomats coming forward and telling this story.

adam schiff You know, there’s no revolt, and there’s no deep state. sheryl gay stolberg I’m being —

nicholas fandos

He quibbled a little bit with the wording that Sheryl used. But he basically said, I agree with the premise of the question.

adam schiff I think it’s a very serious attack on career public servants who are unwilling to compromise themselves in the president’s service. This has to be the last question because I’ve got to go vote on the last vote. sheryl gay stolberg I have two more real quickies. Do you have enough evidence to impeach? adam schiff I’ve got to go vote. sheryl gay stolberg Can he come back or is that it? nicholas fandos I can ask.

michael barbaro

So another busy day. Where is your head as Wednesday comes to an end?

nicholas fandos

So by the end of Wednesday, it just feels inescapable that this is all building, at least this week, towards Gordon Sondland coming in himself on Thursday and giving his account of what happened, of facing questions about these various accusations and accounts that investigators have been getting all week. And figuring out, how does he explain this stuff? How does he view what was going on? And we left the Capitol Wednesday evening waiting to see exactly what he was going to say.

michael barbaro

Right. Like, if this is a play, the character that everyone’s been talking about for the last 90 minutes eventually has to come onstage and say something.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Except for, in this case, the stage is behind closed doors. And saying something, it turns out, amounts to releasing an 18-page opening statement Thursday morning right before he begins to answer questions.

nicholas fandos Hello. michael barbaro Hi. nicholas fandos Welcome. michael barbaro Very nice to see you. nicholas fandos Very nice to see you.

michael barbaro

So that’s how Thursday morning begins. I walk into the Capitol with Rachel and Clare just as, it seems, you are digesting Gordon Sondland’s opening statements.

nicholas fandos And my morning was basically spent trying to go through 18 pages of what he was going to go in there and say.

nicholas fandos

We received a copy of his opening statement. And Mike Schmidt, our colleague, and I pored through it to try and figure out, what’s new here? What’s he addressing? What does he have to say? And a couple of things jumped out at us. He basically says, in a meeting that he had with President Trump in May, not long after the new Ukrainian president is elected, President Trump basically rejected Sondland’s advice and the advice of other diplomats that were with him who said, you know, Mr. President, we think you ought to meet with this new guy. We think he’s going to do good work. Trump didn’t seem interested, and then directed them, Sondland said, to go through Rudy Giuliani, to go through his private lawyer.

michael barbaro

On Ukraine foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

He gave Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, and other high-ranking officials in the room the direct impression that he had empowered Rudy Giuliani to basically run American policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

I mean, all week we’d been hearing these career nonpartisan diplomats coming in and pointing at Gordon Sondland. And here you have Gordon Sondland turning around just as quickly and pointing at the president and Rudy Giuliani and saying, everything I did, I did because they told me to. And I didn’t always feel good about it. I don’t think Rudy Giuliani should have been involved. I think the men and women of the State Department ought to be running our foreign policy, he testified. But I have to follow the directions of the president. And I thought, more or less, that I could work within those parameters to still achieve an end that I believed in, to still help Ukraine. And he said something interesting. He says, I didn’t realize at first. It was only later that I realized that Rudy Giuliani may have had some other motivations in mind. As if all of this is not enough, one of the president’s loyal diplomats seeming to turn on him and point the finger back at him.

michael barbaro Hello. michael shear How are you? michael barbaro Mr. Shear. michael shear Good to see you.

nicholas fandos

My colleague Mike Shear walks up.

michael barbaro I’m just going to say, any email that starts with, “This will be interesting,” I want to read the rest of. michael shear Mick Mulvaney is about to give a press briefing. nicholas fandos Oh, jeez.

nicholas fandos

And says, hey, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who never addresses the press, has just scheduled a 12:30 press conference at the White House. He’s going to talk to reporters. And we think he’s going to talk about Ukraine.

michael shear But, I mean, he should get a lot of questions about this stuff, about impeachment. I mean, he’s going to the White House press briefing room.

nicholas fandos

So Mike and I go back to a press room just outside the SCIF and set up shop around his computer, where we tune into this press conference.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

rachel quester (WHISPERING) What’s happening? michael barbaro We’re with Nick Fandos and Mike Shear watching Mulvaney.

nicholas fandos

He starts to field questions. And it gets crazy really fast.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.

nicholas fandos

After this week of slow drip disclosures, and after weeks of the White House denying that there had been any kind of leverage, or quid pro quo, or exchange with the Ukrainians around the suspension of security aid for the country, he comes out and basically says — he does say, on the record, that —

archived recording So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to the Ukraine? archived recording (mick mulvaney) The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. Then that is absolutely appropriate.

nicholas fandos

The White House withheld the aid for several reasons. And one of those reasons was President Trump wanted Ukraine to first commit to investigating potential collusion between Ukrainians and Democrats in the 2016 election that was meant to undermine his campaign. And on top of it, Mulvaney says, yep, this was the deal.

archived recording Let’s be clear. What you’ve just described is a quid pro quo.

nicholas fandos

Reporters quickly call it a quid pro quo.

archived recording It is — funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well. archived recording (mick mulvaney) We do that all the time with foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

And he said, that’s fine. It happens all the time. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) If you read the news reports, and you believe them — what did McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy, that was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody, get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.

michael barbaro

I mean, that’s an extraordinary thing for the White House chief of staff to say.

nicholas fandos

It is. And he goes a little bit further. He’s asked about Rudy Giuliani and his role. And his defense, again, is essentially that the president of the United States gets to dictate foreign policy. And if he wants his personal lawyer — a guy who he’s not paying, a guy who’s doing business, by the way, in Ukraine at the same time he’s evidently doing diplomacy — to run American foreign policy, well, that’s his prerogative. Elections have consequences. And that’s O.K. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Elections do have consequences. And they should. And your foreign policy is going to change. Obama did it in one way, we’re doing it in a different way. And there’s no problem with that.

nicholas fandos

It’s a pretty stunning assertion. A pretty stunning view of executive power. It suggests the White House has not been telling the whole truth up till today.

michael barbaro

And then decided to tell it in a kind of extreme, unexpected way.

nicholas fandos

Right. It’s a little baffling to understand what exactly Mick Mulvaney was doing here.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) I’m not going to take anymore. It’s nice to see everybody. Thanks again. nicholas fandos All right, so we should — we should get on the phone. mike shear What the hell just happened? michael barbaro Why don’t you take some time to figure out what this all means? nicholas fandos There’s also probably about to be a House vote, where we may need to go and see if we can’t get some quick reaction.

nicholas fandos

You know, it was pretty evident in the hour or so after that press conference that lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn’t quite know what to make of it either.

recording^

Today, the chief of staff said what we’ve always just talked about. It was also about exonerating Russia and looking at the 2016 election.

nicholas fandos

Some said, well, they just admitted to the whole thing, I suppose. So what do we do now? Others, Adam Schiff said —

archived recording (adam schiff) It certainly indicates that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.

nicholas fandos

A story that’s very, very bad just got much, much worse.

michael barbaro

Well, to the extent, Nick, that it’s knowable, what do you make of why the White House decided to do this? It’s kind of hard to understand.

nicholas fandos

It is. We don’t know if Mulvaney was acting on his own authority, who had put him out there. The president’s legal team, one of his other lawyers who’s not Rudy Giuliani, said he hadn’t been consulted before Mulvaney went out there. You know, there has been a move that President Trump returns to time and again in his presidency. And part of me wonders if this isn’t the same thing, where, when he’s being accused of something bad, of having done something under the table or that would be deemed inappropriate for others, instead of pretending he didn’t, he just kind of throws it all out into the open and says, you know, yeah, I did this. But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. So what? Tell me it’s wrong. And I think at the end of this week, one of the biggest questions that I think emerges from all this stuff is that it’s now up to Congress, not just Democrats, but Republicans, too, to answer that question and say, is this right, or is this wrong? If he’s going to own up to most of it, and assuming that more officials come forward and fill in different pieces of this story as we’re coming to understand it, you know, can they stomach that? And is that a transgression that they’re willing to say is worthy of impeachment and worthy of his removal from office? I mean, it’s kind of on the president’s part, potentially, the ultimate high-stakes bluff, and I don’t think we know yet where things are going to fall out.

[music]

nicholas fandos

I think what we’re left with at the end of this week is, like, a question. Is this a story of a bunch of career diplomats, who have never really much liked President Trump or his policies, rebelling against him? And I don’t think that they really see it that way. From their perspective, you know, they’re used to having policy differences with presidents of both parties. They’re trained to implement the policies of Republicans and of Democrats. What I think is different, what is leading otherwise anonymous officials to blow the whistle, to march up to Capitol Hill and walk down all those flights of steps to the House SCIF and tell the story as they see it, is that they see this as something fundamentally different, and, importantly, as a part of their responsibility as permanent agents of the government, of people who are working on behalf of the American people, not a particular president, and that only when things seem to get so bad did they decide they needed to speak up.

michael barbaro

Nick, thank you for essentially giving us your entire week. We appreciate it.

nicholas fandos

It was a pleasure to have the company.

michael barbaro

It can get lonely in front of a SCIF, I imagine. Anyway, thank you, truly.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, I’m glad you guys were here. It’s been quite a story.

michael barbaro

The rest — so on Thursday night, there was a huge bipartisan outcry, and the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, tries to walk back his comments about a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He issues a statement essentially denying what he has said just a few hours earlier. And I’m going to read you the quote. He said, “Let me be clear. There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.” We’ll be right back.

sheryl gay stolberg How does it sound? michael barbaro It sounds pretty good. sheryl gay stolberg Sound O.K.? michael barbaro I’ve never actually produced a bit of — any audio on my own. So this is a bit of an experiment. sheryl gay stolberg O.K., great. michael barbaro And I think this is definitely the first time we have done the headlines of “The Daily” inside the Senate press gallery. So Sheryl Stolberg — oh, I think, I’m supposed to hold this to my own mouth.

michael barbaro

So Sheryl, what do we need to know today?

sheryl gay stolberg

So it was a really busy news day.

archived recording (mike pence) Today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdogan in Turkey and the United States of America that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.

sheryl gay stolberg

Vice President Pence flew to Turkey, and on Thursday afternoon, he announced that Turkey had agreed to a cease-fire in which the Turkish government would suspend its military operations in northern Syria for five days in order to give the Kurds time to clear the area. So that raises the question, is this a breakthrough, or is this just giving Turkey what it wants in the first place, because they wanted the Kurds out?

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording Will you support this deal? What do you think of it? archived recording (jeremy corbyn) Well, from what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or our expectations.

sheryl gay stolberg

There’s finally a deal for Brexit that the European Union and Britain both think will work. But it’s not clear if it’s going to pass, because it has to go through Parliament, and the Labour Party has already said it’s opposed.

archived recording (jeremy corbyn) We are unhappy with this deal, and as it stands, we’ll vote against it.

sheryl gay stolberg

And finally, on Thursday, it was a sad day here in the Capitol, because Representative Elijah Cummings, a towering figure in the House, died. Cummings was a son of sharecroppers. His own presence here was really a miracle to him.

archived recording (elijah cummings) My father had never been in the Capitol building. He said, isn’t this the place where they used to call us slaves? I said, yes sir. And isn’t this the place they used to call us three-fifths of a man? I said, yes, sir. And isn’t this the place that they used to call us chattel? I say, yes, yes, yes, sir. And I’ll never forget, he said, when I think about you being sworn in today, he said, now I see what I could have been if I had had an opportunity.

sheryl gay stolberg

And over the last year, as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he had been a central figure in the investigations of the president, and in his role in these investigations, he continually pleaded for decency.

archived recording (elijah cummings) We are better than this. We are so much — we really are. As a country, we are so much better than this. And I’m hoping that all of us can get back to this democracy that we want and that we should be passing on to our children so that they can do better than what we did.

michael barbaro

Sheryl, thank you.

sheryl gay stolberg

Thank you, Michael.

clare toeniskoetter We’re walking out?

Oh, we’re waiting for Nick to get off the phone. clare toeniskoetter We also could say hi. michael barbaro I have a croissant I’d like to finish.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

speaker Are you going to bring him in for a deposition?

michael barbaro

Today —

speaker 1 Nothing further at this moment. speaker 2 Does this move the ball for impeachment, in your mind?

michael barbaro

A week inside the U.S. Capitol as the impeachment inquiry enters a pivotal phase. It’s Friday, October 18.

nicholas fandos There’s a bunch of rooms, so — michael barbaro O.K. clare toeniskoetter What’s going on? michael barbaro We’re just trying to find a room that is quiet enough to make an episode of “The Daily.” nicholas fandos I think this will work.

michael barbaro

O.K. Here we go. Nick Fandos, you’ve been on the Hill all week. Walk me through this. What does the impeachment inquiry actually look like on the ground?

nicholas fandos

Yeah. So, I mean, the crazy thing is that the house opened this impeachment inquiry a little more than three weeks ago now on their way out of town for a two-week recess. So members were scattered all over the country, meeting with constituents, holding town halls, while back here in the Capitol, a core group of staff members, basically, for the House Intelligence Committee and a couple of others, stuck around and began issuing subpoenas and requests, setting up the very first witness depositions for their investigation. And so this week was the week that five of those depositions, one a day, were lined up, and lawmakers were going to be coming back. So that’s kind of what I was expecting when I arrived at the Capitol on Monday.

rachel quester Hello. nicholas fandos Hey, it’s Nick. rachel quester Hi, how’s it going?

nicholas fandos

And I met up with our colleagues from “The Daily,” Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter, who were going to spend the week with me.

nicholas fandos It’s so nice outside. rachel quester It’s so nice outside.

nicholas fandos

We had to meet up outside of the Capitol because it was Columbus Day, actually. The press galleries and all the functional staff were not working here. So I had to escort them in specially. We walked inside and down three sets of stairs.

clare toeniskoetter Where are we? nicholas fandos We’re standing now beside the doors to the House Intelligence Committee SCIF.

nicholas fandos

And at the bottom of those stairs, we end up at the secured rooms, we call it the SCIF, of the House Intelligence Committee —

clare toeniskoetter Wait, SCIF? Secure — nicholas fandos Compartmentalized Information Facility.

nicholas fandos

— which is one of the most secretive in Congress. It’s where this investigation is taking place, all behind closed doors.

nicholas fandos And they have these red stickers on them, which get photographed all the time and are always in the newspaper, which just say “restricted area.” You can’t go there.

nicholas fandos

So the three of us and a bunch of reporters were gathered around outside, basically waiting for any emissaries to come out of the room and give some sense of what was going on back there with the very first witness deposition.

nicholas fandos We spend all day trying to mentally pierce that barrier.

michael barbaro

So it says something about this week that this room is where Congress is holding these hearings.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, that’s right. I mean, it’s entirely outside of the public view. This is an investigation that could result in an attempt to remove President Trump. And the earliest stages of the investigation, at least, are all being conducted out of public view. And this has been a source of some contention early on.

archived recording (jim jordan) The first two interviews, totalling approximately 20 hours, not one single thing was said in those respective interviews that the American people should not be able to see, should not be able to hear.

nicholas fandos

Republicans have really seized on it to accuse Democrats of, basically, trying to impeach Trump in private —

archived recording (jim jordan) The tragedy here, and the crime here, is that the American people don’t get to see what’s going on in these sessions.

nicholas fandos

— of hiding important work from the American people and from the press, who might be able to evaluate it. And the Democrats argue, though, that basically, this is investigative best practice. That, unlike past impeachments, they don’t already know what the story is. They need to find out the details. And the best way to investigate it is in private, where witnesses can’t line up their stories by hearing what somebody else testified, where lawyers can ask most of the questions, rather than lawmakers who are, maybe, trying to fundraise off of some quip, or speak to their constituents at a public hearing. And this allows them, ideally, to move quickly and collect a lot of information efficiently. And then, they figure out, what have we found? And what is the best of what we’ve got? And they move that, then, into the public sphere. And they present that evidence, they invite their best witnesses to come and testify, and they can kind of control the story that they’re building against the president.

michael barbaro

Much like a prosecutor, or a district attorney, quietly builds a case, makes an announcement of whether or not there’s an indictment, and then goes to trial.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. The rub, of course, is that this is Congress. And politicians love to blab. They get information that looks damaging to the president. If you’re a Democrat, you’d love for that to get out.

michael barbaro

So what’s the situation on Monday when it comes to these hearings? What’s actually happening in that SCIF, behind those closed doors?

nicholas fandos

So for most of the day Monday, all I know is that this former White House official, Fiona Hill, is in there testifying. And it’s hour after hour after hour. There’s very little information coming out. My feet are getting sore.

nicholas fandos Hey. Are you still free?

nicholas fandos

Chit-chatting with other reporters. Basically waiting for any kind of emissary to come out of the room and give us a sense of what’s going on.

nicholas fandos It seems pretty quiet. I think Schiff just left to go — he’s speaking at the 92nd Street Y.

michael barbaro

You’re just spending the day standing outside this room.

nicholas fandos

Right.

nicholas fandos [SIGHS] clare toeniskoetter How many hours do you think you’ve spent standing, waiting, doing nothing so far? nicholas fandos I don’t know. Probably north of 30 hours, 35 hours. But it’ll get worse.

nicholas fandos

And it was a long day. And, eventually, the sun goes down. Fiona Hill is still not done. And she finally leaves at about 8 o’clock.

clare toeniskoetter Bye, thank you!

nicholas fandos

I just kind of had to go home. Because there was not a whole lot more reporting to do here.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

nicholas fandos

And it was only as I was walking back up to my apartment building that I started hearing from some sources and being able to piece together, over the next couple of hours, what had actually happened that day. And the testimony, it turns out, was pretty remarkable.

michael barbaro

What was the testimony?

nicholas fandos

So you’ve got to keep in mind, Fiona Hill is a respected career Russia expert who was brought in to the Trump administration to work for John Bolton on the National Security Council as one of the president’s top advisers on Europe and Russia policy. So she’s right at the center of traditional decision making around policy towards Ukraine. And the account that she gives is that there was a meeting earlier this summer in July where several other diplomats, including Gordon Sondland, a former Trump donor who had become ambassador to the European Union, met with some Ukrainian officials. And she tells lawmakers that this meeting veered dangerously off course, from her perspective, and that she and her boss, John Bolton, were so alarmed by what was said that Bolton told her, you need to go to White House lawyers right now and tell them that we’re not part of, and this was a quote, “whatever drug deal” these guys are cooking up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

Not a literal drug deal. But what Bolton and Hill thought was going on is that Sondland and the president’s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were basically holding out from the Ukrainians a White House meeting with President Trump, which is what they wanted, as leverage for the Ukrainians agreeing to investigate Democrats and Democratic issues that could benefit the president politically. Hill also testified that, at one point, Bolton referred to Giuliani as a “hand grenade” that’s “going to blow everybody up.” And so we were able to basically pull together this and some other elements of the story and publish it, I think, about 10:30 at night, and really be able to tell the story of day one behind those closed doors.

michael barbaro

So beyond this being a very juicy scoop, what’s the significance of the testimony that Fiona Hill gave? What does it do for the inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So there are a couple things that I would say. One is that she implicates her boss, John Bolton, who is a boldface name in Washington. He’s the president’s top national security adviser. And saying that high up in the chain, the president’s national security adviser is calling this a “drug deal,” was so concerned about this he had me go to the lawyers — and it kind of opened the door to the fact that this set of events that we’re learning about in retrospect were setting off alarms in real time, and at very high levels of the government. The other aspect of it, though, is that I’m looking ahead to the rest of the week, and it seems pretty clear she’s not going to be the last person. Unlike in past investigations, where the White House has successfully shut down Congress, important witnesses are coming, and they’re going to talk, and they’re going to tell their story. We’re actually going to understand what happened here.

michael barbaro

Nick, I guess I just have, like, a collegial inquiry here. What’s the point of standing around all day if you end up getting the best stuff when you get home at, like, 10 o’clock at night?

nicholas fandos

[LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Doesn’t that suggest that maybe you’re not going about this in the most efficient way?

nicholas fandos

Uhh, it’s a fair point. But we do learn some pretty significant details that set the stage for the rest of the week.

michael barbaro

O.K. So what happens the next day, on Tuesday?

rachel quester Ready for day two. clare toeniskoetter Yeah.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday, we know that there is going to be another one of these closed-door depositions that’s probably going to go on again for hours, this time with a senior State Department official who was more or less in charge of Ukraine policy for the State Department.

speaker 1 So Julie’s group, we’re going to gather up. Make sure we have everybody. I don’t see Brian. speaker 2 I don’t either.

nicholas fandos

But the first thing that I notice as I arrive at the Capitol is that the place has been transformed overnight.

rachel quester O.K., so Nick just walked away, because he got a call from a member of Congress.

nicholas fandos

After two weeks of recess, lawmakers are back.

speaker Madam Speaker, will there be an formal vote on an impeachment inquiry? Madam Speaker?

nicholas fandos

There are even tourists wandering around through the SCIF area, running into reporters.

speaker 1 In part to keep an eye on the British. speaker 2 Yeah, it’s somewhere up there. Oh, wait. There we go.

nicholas fandos

Stopping, looking at the TV reporters, who they recognize from CNN.

speaker 1 Have you guys heard of the whole impeachment inquiry? speaker 2 Mm-hmm. speaker 3 Yeah. That’s craziness.

nicholas fandos

The press corps seems to have somehow doubled. I don’t know how, because it’s already been huge following this stuff. And there’s just kind of an energy gripping the place that comes with 535 or so lawmakers and their staff, their kind of entourages, being back, moving around the Capitol.

michael barbaro

Can any member of Congress walk into the SCIF, right by you, and actually listen to these depositions as testimony?

nicholas fandos

The answer is no. And we actually saw it a couple times this week, when Republicans tried to go in and sit in on these depositions. But they were not on the committees that are leading the investigation. And therefore, under the committee rules, they ended up getting kicked out. But with lawmakers back in town, you’re talking about three committees that are leading the impeachment investigation. That’s dozens and dozens of lawmakers that sit on those. And they can all go and sit in. And they can come out, and they’re not supposed to talk in detail about what transpired, but they can give general impressions and hints about what they heard. In one case, one Democrat came out and basically broke the rules and just talked about what was happening completely.

archived recording How did the questioning go today, Gerry? archived recording (gerry connolly) I thought it was very powerful testimony.

michael barbaro

And what did this Democrat divulge?

nicholas fandos

So he comes out and says —

archived recording (gerry connolly) Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine —

nicholas fandos

— that he’d just heard the witness in the room, a State Department official named George Kent —

archived recording (gerry connolly) — who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine.

nicholas fandos

— that he and other career diplomats who were in charge of the State Department’s policy toward Ukraine had been shoved aside —

archived recording (gerry connolly) All of the people charged with policy in Ukraine were replaced, apparently, after a May 23rd meeting at the White House organized by Mick Mulvaney, not John Bolton or Pompeo.

nicholas fandos

— and were told, starting late in the spring, that basically, their services weren’t needed anymore —

archived recording (gerry connolly) And that was wrong. He used that word, “wrong.”

nicholas fandos

— that policy towards Ukraine was going to be run by Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, and others out of the White House —

archived recording (gerry connolly) The import of this testimony is deeply disturbing, especially the role of Rudy Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

— and they may as well lay low.

michael barbaro

And what’s the significance of that?

nicholas fandos

So the significance of that is that you have here another high-level American diplomat saying that the normal channels for foreign policy that have guided American policy for quite a long time are being stepped on, basically, by the White House, which is putting their own guys in charge. And one of them that he singles out, yet again, is Gordon Sondland. Now you have a second witness, two in two days, coming forward and giving a pretty consistent account. This is all picking up a little bit of momentum.

michael barbaro

So I’m taking it you didn’t watch the Democratic debate.

nicholas fandos

I did not watch the Democratic debate, and I did not watch playoff baseball.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

nicholas fandos

What if we take a 20-minute break, and I can go and satisfy my editors a little bit by updating some stories?

michael barbaro

Yeah. All right. We’ll be back, as we say.

nicholas fandos

O.K. More soon.

clare toeniskoetter Thanks, Nick. nicholas fandos You guys going to hang here? michael barbaro Yeah. rachel quester O.K. Should we go to break there?

michael barbaro

That was the idea.

clare toeniskoetter See ya!

michael barbaro

O.K. So Wednesday.

nicholas fandos

Wednesday. Another day, another diplomat. This time, it’s a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who quit the State Department last week, reportedly because he was so frustrated by the very things that we’re talking about. He tried to raise alarms by that and didn’t get a response. And he was so fed up, he said he quit. So it’s clear after three days of testimony that we’re starting to see the diplomatic and foreign policy core, the expertise, the professional class that handles American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican administrations, basically coming one by one to tell a remarkably consistent story about how, in ways that they were uncomfortable with and they had not seen before, they were getting pushed aside. And the policy that was being executed in their place — they would say it’s not even a policy — but the actions in their place, basically, rather than, to put it in their words, the policy serving the well-being of the Ukrainians and the United States, it was serving the well-being of the president of the United States. And that was about it.

michael barbaro

But how exactly is that the basis of an impeachment inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not the fact that they were pushed aside that they see as so problematic. They’re telling a story about what happened once they were pushed aside. They think that’s created a set of conditions that led to these events that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. And that’s really what investigators are trying to get to the bottom of. And now, they’ve been able to establish how the circumstances, or the scene, was set for those things to happen by these current and former diplomats. But they still have more investigative work to flesh that out. ^CLARE TOENISKOETTER^ O.K., we’re walking up.

speaker All right. So I’m going to just watch for — nicholas fandos If that’s O.K. speaker Yeah, yeah.

nicholas fandos

So in the middle of all this on Wednesday, I meet up with my colleague, Sheryl Stolberg.

nicholas fandos Yeah, we’ll probably go to one of those tables. sheryl gay stolberg You think it’ll be a standing interview? nicholas fandos I hope not. But, you know, a guy’s got to get his steps in.

nicholas fandos

And we’re going to go upstairs into the Capitol to interview Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who chairs the Intelligence Committee and is the man at the center of all these hearings leading the impeachment investigation. We had been hoping to sit down with Schiff in his office and have a kind of quieter, more reflective meeting. But indicative of the way things are in the middle of this inquiry, his staff asked, instead, if we could meet in a reception room.

sheryl gay stolberg Let’s take this corner.

nicholas fandos

Right off the floor of the Capitol, where there were different meet-and-greets going on, and constituents were meeting with their members of Congress. And the room was buzzing and lively. And we staked out a corner where we could talk to Congressman Schiff.

adam schiff How are you doing? nicholas fandos How are you? adam schiff Good. nicholas fandos Here, and Sheryl’s over here too. sheryl gay stolberg Hi! adam schiff Hi, how are you?

nicholas fandos

And we were able to put to him some, kind of, key questions about what we thought was going on to see how he sees it.

sheryl gay stolberg You know, the president talks a lot about the deep state. Does it strike you that this is exactly what he fears, or what he thinks of as the deep state? adam schiff You know, the deep state theory used to be a fringe theory in third-world countries or kooky conspiracy theorists at home. When the president talks about the deep state, what he’s really talking about is, in particular, people that expose his wrongdoing and misconduct.

nicholas fandos

At one point, we put the question to him of what he made of all these diplomats coming forward and telling this story.

adam schiff You know, there’s no revolt, and there’s no deep state. sheryl gay stolberg I’m being —

nicholas fandos

He quibbled a little bit with the wording that Sheryl used. But he basically said, I agree with the premise of the question.

adam schiff I think it’s a very serious attack on career public servants who are unwilling to compromise themselves in the president’s service. This has to be the last question because I’ve got to go vote on the last vote. sheryl gay stolberg I have two more real quickies. Do you have enough evidence to impeach? adam schiff I’ve got to go vote. sheryl gay stolberg Can he come back or is that it? nicholas fandos I can ask.

michael barbaro

So another busy day. Where is your head as Wednesday comes to an end?

nicholas fandos

So by the end of Wednesday, it just feels inescapable that this is all building, at least this week, towards Gordon Sondland coming in himself on Thursday and giving his account of what happened, of facing questions about these various accusations and accounts that investigators have been getting all week. And figuring out, how does he explain this stuff? How does he view what was going on? And we left the Capitol Wednesday evening waiting to see exactly what he was going to say.

michael barbaro

Right. Like, if this is a play, the character that everyone’s been talking about for the last 90 minutes eventually has to come onstage and say something.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Except for, in this case, the stage is behind closed doors. And saying something, it turns out, amounts to releasing an 18-page opening statement Thursday morning right before he begins to answer questions.

nicholas fandos Hello. michael barbaro Hi. nicholas fandos Welcome. michael barbaro Very nice to see you. nicholas fandos Very nice to see you.

michael barbaro

So that’s how Thursday morning begins. I walk into the Capitol with Rachel and Clare just as, it seems, you are digesting Gordon Sondland’s opening statements.

nicholas fandos And my morning was basically spent trying to go through 18 pages of what he was going to go in there and say.

nicholas fandos

We received a copy of his opening statement. And Mike Schmidt, our colleague, and I pored through it to try and figure out, what’s new here? What’s he addressing? What does he have to say? And a couple of things jumped out at us. He basically says, in a meeting that he had with President Trump in May, not long after the new Ukrainian president is elected, President Trump basically rejected Sondland’s advice and the advice of other diplomats that were with him who said, you know, Mr. President, we think you ought to meet with this new guy. We think he’s going to do good work. Trump didn’t seem interested, and then directed them, Sondland said, to go through Rudy Giuliani, to go through his private lawyer.

michael barbaro

On Ukraine foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

He gave Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, and other high-ranking officials in the room the direct impression that he had empowered Rudy Giuliani to basically run American policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

I mean, all week we’d been hearing these career nonpartisan diplomats coming in and pointing at Gordon Sondland. And here you have Gordon Sondland turning around just as quickly and pointing at the president and Rudy Giuliani and saying, everything I did, I did because they told me to. And I didn’t always feel good about it. I don’t think Rudy Giuliani should have been involved. I think the men and women of the State Department ought to be running our foreign policy, he testified. But I have to follow the directions of the president. And I thought, more or less, that I could work within those parameters to still achieve an end that I believed in, to still help Ukraine. And he said something interesting. He says, I didn’t realize at first. It was only later that I realized that Rudy Giuliani may have had some other motivations in mind. As if all of this is not enough, one of the president’s loyal diplomats seeming to turn on him and point the finger back at him.

michael barbaro Hello. michael shear How are you? michael barbaro Mr. Shear. michael shear Good to see you.

nicholas fandos

My colleague Mike Shear walks up.

michael barbaro I’m just going to say, any email that starts with, “This will be interesting,” I want to read the rest of. michael shear Mick Mulvaney is about to give a press briefing. nicholas fandos Oh, jeez.

nicholas fandos

And says, hey, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who never addresses the press, has just scheduled a 12:30 press conference at the White House. He’s going to talk to reporters. And we think he’s going to talk about Ukraine.

michael shear But, I mean, he should get a lot of questions about this stuff, about impeachment. I mean, he’s going to the White House press briefing room.

nicholas fandos

So Mike and I go back to a press room just outside the SCIF and set up shop around his computer, where we tune into this press conference.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

rachel quester (WHISPERING) What’s happening? michael barbaro We’re with Nick Fandos and Mike Shear watching Mulvaney.

nicholas fandos

He starts to field questions. And it gets crazy really fast.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.

nicholas fandos

After this week of slow drip disclosures, and after weeks of the White House denying that there had been any kind of leverage, or quid pro quo, or exchange with the Ukrainians around the suspension of security aid for the country, he comes out and basically says — he does say, on the record, that —

archived recording So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to the Ukraine? archived recording (mick mulvaney) The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. Then that is absolutely appropriate.

nicholas fandos

The White House withheld the aid for several reasons. And one of those reasons was President Trump wanted Ukraine to first commit to investigating potential collusion between Ukrainians and Democrats in the 2016 election that was meant to undermine his campaign. And on top of it, Mulvaney says, yep, this was the deal.

archived recording Let’s be clear. What you’ve just described is a quid pro quo.

Reporters quickly call it a quid pro quo.

archived recording It is — funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well. archived recording (mick mulvaney) We do that all the time with foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

And he said, that’s fine. It happens all the time. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) If you read the news reports, and you believe them — what did McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy, that was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody, get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.

michael barbaro

I mean, that’s an extraordinary thing for the White House chief of staff to say.

nicholas fandos

It is. And he goes a little bit further. He’s asked about Rudy Giuliani and his role. And his defense, again, is essentially that the president of the United States gets to dictate foreign policy. And if he wants his personal lawyer — a guy who he’s not paying, a guy who’s doing business, by the way, in Ukraine at the same time he’s evidently doing diplomacy — to run American foreign policy, well, that’s his prerogative. Elections have consequences. And that’s O.K. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Elections do have consequences. And they should. And your foreign policy is going to change. Obama did it in one way, we’re doing it in a different way. And there’s no problem with that.

nicholas fandos

It’s a pretty stunning assertion. A pretty stunning view of executive power. It suggests the White House has not been telling the whole truth up till today.

michael barbaro

And then decided to tell it in a kind of extreme, unexpected way.

nicholas fandos

Right. It’s a little baffling to understand what exactly Mick Mulvaney was doing here.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) I’m not going to take anymore. It’s nice to see everybody. Thanks again. nicholas fandos All right, so we should — we should get on the phone. mike shear What the hell just happened? michael barbaro Why don’t you take some time to figure out what this all means? nicholas fandos There’s also probably about to be a House vote, where we may need to go and see if we can’t get some quick reaction.

nicholas fandos

You know, it was pretty evident in the hour or so after that press conference that lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn’t quite know what to make of it either.

recording^

Today, the chief of staff said what we’ve always just talked about. It was also about exonerating Russia and looking at the 2016 election.

nicholas fandos

Some said, well, they just admitted to the whole thing, I suppose. So what do we do now? Others, Adam Schiff said —

archived recording (adam schiff) It certainly indicates that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.

nicholas fandos

A story that’s very, very bad just got much, much worse.

michael barbaro

Well, to the extent, Nick, that it’s knowable, what do you make of why the White House decided to do this? It’s kind of hard to understand.

nicholas fandos

It is. We don’t know if Mulvaney was acting on his own authority, who had put him out there. The president’s legal team, one of his other lawyers who’s not Rudy Giuliani, said he hadn’t been consulted before Mulvaney went out there. You know, there has been a move that President Trump returns to time and again in his presidency. And part of me wonders if this isn’t the same thing, where, when he’s being accused of something bad, of having done something under the table or that would be deemed inappropriate for others, instead of pretending he didn’t, he just kind of throws it all out into the open and says, you know, yeah, I did this. But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. So what? Tell me it’s wrong. And I think at the end of this week, one of the biggest questions that I think emerges from all this stuff is that it’s now up to Congress, not just Democrats, but Republicans, too, to answer that question and say, is this right, or is this wrong? If he’s going to own up to most of it, and assuming that more officials come forward and fill in different pieces of this story as we’re coming to understand it, you know, can they stomach that? And is that a transgression that they’re willing to say is worthy of impeachment and worthy of his removal from office? I mean, it’s kind of on the president’s part, potentially, the ultimate high-stakes bluff, and I don’t think we know yet where things are going to fall out.

nicholas fandos

I think what we’re left with at the end of this week is, like, a question. Is this a story of a bunch of career diplomats, who have never really much liked President Trump or his policies, rebelling against him? And I don’t think that they really see it that way. From their perspective, you know, they’re used to having policy differences with presidents of both parties. They’re trained to implement the policies of Republicans and of Democrats. What I think is different, what is leading otherwise anonymous officials to blow the whistle, to march up to Capitol Hill and walk down all those flights of steps to the House SCIF and tell the story as they see it, is that they see this as something fundamentally different, and, importantly, as a part of their responsibility as permanent agents of the government, of people who are working on behalf of the American people, not a particular president, and that only when things seem to get so bad did they decide they needed to speak up.

michael barbaro

michael barbaro

The rest — so on Thursday night, there was a huge bipartisan outcry, and the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, tries to walk back his comments about a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He issues a statement essentially denying what he has said just a few hours earlier. And I’m going to read you the quote. He said, “Let me be clear. There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.” We’ll be right back.

So this is a bit of an experiment. sheryl gay stolberg O.K., great. michael barbaro And I think this is definitely the first time we have done the headlines of “The Daily” inside the Senate press gallery. So Sheryl Stolberg — oh, I think, I’m supposed to hold this to my own mouth.

michael barbaro

So Sheryl, what do we need to know today?

sheryl gay stolberg

So it was a really busy news day.

archived recording (mike pence) Today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdogan in Turkey and the United States of America that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.

sheryl gay stolberg

Vice President Pence flew to Turkey, and on Thursday afternoon, he announced that Turkey had agreed to a cease-fire in which the Turkish government would suspend its military operations in northern Syria for five days in order to give the Kurds time to clear the area. So that raises the question, is this a breakthrough, or is this just giving Turkey what it wants in the first place, because they wanted the Kurds out?

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording Will you support this deal? What do you think of it? archived recording (jeremy corbyn) Well, from what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or our expectations.

sheryl gay stolberg

There’s finally a deal for Brexit that the European Union and Britain both think will work. But it’s not clear if it’s going to pass, because it has to go through Parliament, and the Labour Party has already said it’s opposed.

archived recording (jeremy corbyn) We are unhappy with this deal, and as it stands, we’ll vote against it.

sheryl gay stolberg

And finally, on Thursday, it was a sad day here in the Capitol, because Representative Elijah Cummings, a towering figure in the House, died. Cummings was a son of sharecroppers. His own presence here was really a miracle to him.

archived recording (elijah cummings) My father had never been in the Capitol building. He said, isn’t this the place where they used to call us slaves? I said, yes sir. And isn’t this the place they used to call us three-fifths of a man? I said, yes, sir. And isn’t this the place that they used to call us chattel? I say, yes, yes, yes, sir. And I’ll never forget, he said, when I think about you being sworn in today, he said, now I see what I could have been if I had had an opportunity.

sheryl gay stolberg

And over the last year, as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he had been a central figure in the investigations of the president, and in his role in these investigations, he continually pleaded for decency.

archived recording (elijah cummings) We are better than this. We are so much — we really are. As a country, we are so much better than this. And I’m hoping that all of us can get back to this democracy that we want and that we should be passing on to our children so that they can do better than what we did.

It is part of the gig. But Trump’s way of lurching into a room is inseparable from his propensity for creating chaos and obliterating meaning. “Thank you very much, thank you very much,” he booms as he steps into the United Nations lobby. He seems to be addressing this thanks to everyone in the room, as if all those present have just burst into applause. (They haven’t.) He is merely Being Trump, doing what he does when he shows up anyplace, whether it’s a meeting of the Group of 7 or a wreath-laying commemoration at Arlington National Cemetery or a Super Bowl party at Mar-a-Lago: subjugating the entire purpose of the event to his own ego and id. It is a demeanor that announces that if anything is going to get done today, it will happen in spite, probably in defiance, of the president of the United States.

Trump wound up attending the climate meeting for about 15 minutes. There were more pressing matters to attend to. He posted on Twitter a dozen times that day, including tweets mocking Mitt Romney, Joe Biden and Adam Schiff. He also directed a trolling tweet at Thunberg: “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!”

We are not “all Greta Thunberg,” but all of us know what it’s like to be ambushed by Donald Trump. He pops up on your social media feed with hateful words and impulsive policy announcements. He flickers on TV screens in bus terminals and airport departure lounges, forever looming over your shoulder. He barges unbidden into your dreams. It is a condition of being alive in America in 2019. No matter who you are or what you’re trying to accomplish, whether you’re a 16-year-old working to save the planet or an ordinary citizen trying to make it through the day with some peace of mind intact, you will inevitably confront the specter of Trump, drifting into the frame in a cloud of disorder and bad vibes. Even the president’s most dedicated enablers scan the sky warily, awaiting today’s cyclone, the next reckless, capricious twist of the plot. The door swings open, the president enters, all heads turn. The camera whips around, and suddenly, everything else — better angels, higher ideals, common decency, common sense, beauty, truth — blurs into the background."

Ultimately, that was what happened. The Justice Department, which was led at the time by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, did not see merit in deporting Mr. Gulen, said one former official familiar with the matter.

Throughout 2017, before Mr. Giuliani began representing Mr. Trump as his personal lawyer, he appeared at the White House to discuss a number of issues related to Turkey, according to two former administration officials. At one point, officials tried to divert Mr. Giuliani’s access to the president so that he was raising his issues with the president’s senior advisers instead of Mr. Trump directly.

Also on Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani’s lawyer, Jon A. Sale, said in a letter to the House Intelligence Committee that he would not hand over documents to the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry because the information requested was “beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry” and a violation of attorney-client and executive privilege.

In a confrontational tweet that echoed the president’s condemnation of the investigations, Mr. Giuliani said he “will not participate in an illegitimate, unconstitutional, and baseless ‘impeachment inquiry.’”

Mr. Giuliani appeared to reject the idea that his decision to defy the subpoena would place him in any legal jeopardy. He said in his tweet that Mr. Sale would no longer be representing him on impeachment matters.

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis.

Focusing only on taxes is pointless. But in a larger way, she’s wrong.

The No. 1 reason to question her version of Medicare for All — in which private health insurance would be eliminated — is its political viability. It would be an enormous disruption to the health care system, and history shows that health care disruptions are very hard to pass and usually unpopular at first. Polls show that her plan is already unpopular, and it would be a bigger disruption than Obamacare or Bill Clinton’s failed plan.

Given all that, she needs to engage with the political realities — with how she would overcome people’s resistance to giving up their health insurance for a larger new program that, yes, would require a tax increase.

I think Warren has run an excellent campaign on the whole, and I think she has the most thoughtful agenda for addressing the stagnating living standards of most Americans. I’m surprised that she has chosen to focus so much of her candidacy on the most aggressive version of Medicare for All. But she has. Now it’s time for her to tell voters how she will deal with the politics of passing it.

In my view, her best answer involves finding a way to signal her openness to a transition, in which people who want to keep their private insurance can do so (and taxes don’t yet need to rise) while Medicare initially expands voluntarily. That idea is hugely popular."

Re “Race Takes Turn as Warren Faces Barrage Onstage” (front page, Oct. 16):

After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:

My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.

But I felt the same way about Hillary Clinton and look how that turned out.

The others do nothing for this 65-year-old longtime Democrat. So how do I vote? I don’t know.

To the Editor:

What struck me most about Tuesday night was how articulate all of the candidates were in expressing their positions compared with the muddled thoughts and language we’ve heard from President Trump ever since he appeared on the national stage.

I watched the debate in a venue sponsored by supporters of Pete Buttigieg. He had some good moments. Then I wondered how he would stack up against Mr. Trump one on one: Would Americans appreciate Pete’s depth and calm or rally to re-elect the pompous bully Trump?"

To answer this question, we must first ask: Which debate are you talking about?

Let’s do, to borrow a word from Andrew Yang’s lapel pin, the math. There were 12 candidates onstage Tuesday, any of whom could have had exchanges with one or more of the others. That made for (counts on fingers) a lot of different interpersonal dynamics. The debate was scheduled for three hours, yet — even with formal opening and closing statements dispensed with — it still ran long.

So there was room for a great number of debates within this debate, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times. This debate had many rooms. It had geologic ages. I believe that somewhere in there, they awarded the Oscar for Best Picture. It is said that near its beginning, the candidates argued about the merits of Medicare for All and how to pay for it, but those are only rumors; no written records remain from that time.

This ultramegasupersized format was the product of the decisions, first, to re-loosen the qualifications that had been tightened for the September debate, where only 10 made the stage, and second, to hold it all on one night, at “Lord of the Rings” length, with as many participants as there are signs of the zodiac.

STEYER: First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise — 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.

If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included productivity gains of American workers, it would be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president. Because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants — health care, education, Green New Deal or a living wage — unless we break the power of these corporations.

BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?

BIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth — what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea — we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said — a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are — there’s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can’t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly — thirdly — what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We are going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting in buying back their stock."

How many trillion???

Mr. Biden, deploying one of his favorite rhetorical weapons against Medicare for All, said Tuesday night that the plan would cost $30 trillion, or roughly 278 Jeff Bezoses, over the next 10 years. But Mr. Sanders has pointed out that that figure is much less than what the current system is projected to cost.

The truth is that no one knows for certain whether the country’s health care costs — which in total and per person far exceed those of any other industrialized country — would go up or down under Medicare for All. Ezekiel J. Emanuel and Victor R. Fuchs explain in The Times:

Medicare for All would move money from one column (private health insurance spending) to another (federal health spending); it does not automatically increase total costs. … We have our doubts about Medicare for All. But unaffordability is not a reason to oppose it.

“In some estimates, the country would not pay more for health care,” a Times analysis of five studies found. Rather, there would be “a drastic shift in who is doing the paying.” For that reason, it is more accurate to think of Mr. Sanders’s plan not as an outlay of (imaginary) money but as a redistribution of it away from insurers, drug companies, health care providers and higher-income people.

About those taxes …

Ms. Warren has drawn criticism for her continued unwillingness during debates to say whether Medicare for All would cause taxes to go up for middle-class families. Mr. Sanders admits they would, but Ms. Warren has refused the premise of the question, emphasizing the money most taxpayers would save overall after premiums (which come out of many people’s paychecks like taxes), deductibles, co-pays and coverage gaps are eliminated.

Middle-class people would “save a lot of money on health care,” the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt told NPR in July. Yet how exactly their net costs would change depends on the particulars of Medicare for All’s funding plans, which neither Mr. Sanders nor Ms. Warren has fully outlined. The Times wrote in a fact check:

Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all.

Why not a public option?

Americans should be allowed to keep their private health insurance, Mr. Buttigieg has argued.

“The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs is that it doesn’t trust the American people,” Mr. Buttigieg said during September’s debate. “I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway.” He elaborated on his own health care plan, which he calls “Medicare for all who want it,” in an earlier debate:

You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.

Critics of public option proposals point out that the path may not actually be so glide-y. That’s because the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs, Benjamin Studebaker and Nathan J. Robinson argue in the left-wing magazine Current Affairs, because it gives the government a monopoly on access to patients. “If instead there are a large number of insurance companies, providers can play those insurance companies off each other,” they write."

“I told the Europeans, maybe this is the best you can expect” from the Trump administration, said Daniel Fried, a former longtime diplomat now with the Atlantic Council. No one imagined, he said, that Mr. Sondland would become a pivotal player “in this bottomless pit” of scandal.

Mr. Sondland, 62, tall and bald, is far from a typical diplomat. Foul-mouthed and unafraid to bruise egos, he craves the limelight, not policy papers and the politics of quiet persuasion that are the staples of diplomacy.

He nonetheless fits a certain mold of ambassadors: The founder of a boutique hotel chain, he landed his post after decades of work bankrolling Republican presidential candidates, including John McCain, Mitt Romney and George W. Bush and his brother Jeb Bush. In Bush family circles, he was particularly well liked.

“There aren’t many people who do it as well as he does,” David Nierenberg, an investment manager in Washington State who worked on Mr. Romney’s campaigns, said of Mr. Sondland’s fund-raising prowess. “He knew how to deliver.”

Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

So the three of us and a bunch of reporters were gathered around outside, basically waiting for any emissaries to come out of the room and give some sense of what was going on back there with the very first witness deposition.

nicholas fandos We spend all day trying to mentally pierce that barrier.

michael barbaro

So it says something about this week that this room is where Congress is holding these hearings.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, that’s right. I mean, it’s entirely outside of the public view. This is an investigation that could result in an attempt to remove President Trump. And the earliest stages of the investigation, at least, are all being conducted out of public view. And this has been a source of some contention early on.

archived recording (jim jordan) The first two interviews, totalling approximately 20 hours, not one single thing was said in those respective interviews that the American people should not be able to see, should not be able to hear.

nicholas fandos

Republicans have really seized on it to accuse Democrats of, basically, trying to impeach Trump in private —

archived recording (jim jordan) The tragedy here, and the crime here, is that the American people don’t get to see what’s going on in these sessions.

nicholas fandos

— of hiding important work from the American people and from the press, who might be able to evaluate it. And the Democrats argue, though, that basically, this is investigative best practice. That, unlike past impeachments, they don’t already know what the story is. They need to find out the details. And the best way to investigate it is in private, where witnesses can’t line up their stories by hearing what somebody else testified, where lawyers can ask most of the questions, rather than lawmakers who are, maybe, trying to fundraise off of some quip, or speak to their constituents at a public hearing. And this allows them, ideally, to move quickly and collect a lot of information efficiently. And then, they figure out, what have we found? And what is the best of what we’ve got? And they move that, then, into the public sphere. And they present that evidence, they invite their best witnesses to come and testify, and they can kind of control the story that they’re building against the president.

michael barbaro

Much like a prosecutor, or a district attorney, quietly builds a case, makes an announcement of whether or not there’s an indictment, and then goes to trial.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. The rub, of course, is that this is Congress. And politicians love to blab. They get information that looks damaging to the president. If you’re a Democrat, you’d love for that to get out.

michael barbaro

So what’s the situation on Monday when it comes to these hearings? What’s actually happening in that SCIF, behind those closed doors?

nicholas fandos

So for most of the day Monday, all I know is that this former White House official, Fiona Hill, is in there testifying. And it’s hour after hour after hour. There’s very little information coming out. My feet are getting sore.

nicholas fandos Hey. Are you still free?

nicholas fandos

Chit-chatting with other reporters. Basically waiting for any kind of emissary to come out of the room and give us a sense of what’s going on.

nicholas fandos It seems pretty quiet. I think Schiff just left to go — he’s speaking at the 92nd Street Y.

michael barbaro

You’re just spending the day standing outside this room.

nicholas fandos

Right.

nicholas fandos [SIGHS] clare toeniskoetter How many hours do you think you’ve spent standing, waiting, doing nothing so far? nicholas fandos I don’t know. Probably north of 30 hours, 35 hours. But it’ll get worse.

nicholas fandos

And it was a long day. And, eventually, the sun goes down. Fiona Hill is still not done. And she finally leaves at about 8 o’clock.

clare toeniskoetter Bye, thank you!

nicholas fandos

I just kind of had to go home. Because there was not a whole lot more reporting to do here.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

nicholas fandos

And it was only as I was walking back up to my apartment building that I started hearing from some sources and being able to piece together, over the next couple of hours, what had actually happened that day. And the testimony, it turns out, was pretty remarkable.

michael barbaro

What was the testimony?

nicholas fandos

So you’ve got to keep in mind, Fiona Hill is a respected career Russia expert who was brought in to the Trump administration to work for John Bolton on the National Security Council as one of the president’s top advisers on Europe and Russia policy. So she’s right at the center of traditional decision making around policy towards Ukraine. And the account that she gives is that there was a meeting earlier this summer in July where several other diplomats, including Gordon Sondland, a former Trump donor who had become ambassador to the European Union, met with some Ukrainian officials. And she tells lawmakers that this meeting veered dangerously off course, from her perspective, and that she and her boss, John Bolton, were so alarmed by what was said that Bolton told her, you need to go to White House lawyers right now and tell them that we’re not part of, and this was a quote, “whatever drug deal” these guys are cooking up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

Not a literal drug deal. But what Bolton and Hill thought was going on is that Sondland and the president’s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were basically holding out from the Ukrainians a White House meeting with President Trump, which is what they wanted, as leverage for the Ukrainians agreeing to investigate Democrats and Democratic issues that could benefit the president politically. Hill also testified that, at one point, Bolton referred to Giuliani as a “hand grenade” that’s “going to blow everybody up.” And so we were able to basically pull together this and some other elements of the story and publish it, I think, about 10:30 at night, and really be able to tell the story of day one behind those closed doors.

michael barbaro

So beyond this being a very juicy scoop, what’s the significance of the testimony that Fiona Hill gave? What does it do for the inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So there are a couple things that I would say. One is that she implicates her boss, John Bolton, who is a boldface name in Washington. He’s the president’s top national security adviser. And saying that high up in the chain, the president’s national security adviser is calling this a “drug deal,” was so concerned about this he had me go to the lawyers — and it kind of opened the door to the fact that this set of events that we’re learning about in retrospect were setting off alarms in real time, and at very high levels of the government. The other aspect of it, though, is that I’m looking ahead to the rest of the week, and it seems pretty clear she’s not going to be the last person. Unlike in past investigations, where the White House has successfully shut down Congress, important witnesses are coming, and they’re going to talk, and they’re going to tell their story. We’re actually going to understand what happened here.

michael barbaro

Nick, I guess I just have, like, a collegial inquiry here. What’s the point of standing around all day if you end up getting the best stuff when you get home at, like, 10 o’clock at night?

nicholas fandos

[LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Doesn’t that suggest that maybe you’re not going about this in the most efficient way?

nicholas fandos

Uhh, it’s a fair point. But we do learn some pretty significant details that set the stage for the rest of the week.

michael barbaro

O.K. So what happens the next day, on Tuesday?

rachel quester Ready for day two. clare toeniskoetter Yeah.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday, we know that there is going to be another one of these closed-door depositions that’s probably going to go on again for hours, this time with a senior State Department official who was more or less in charge of Ukraine policy for the State Department.

speaker 1 So Julie’s group, we’re going to gather up. Make sure we have everybody. I don’t see Brian. speaker 2 I don’t either.

nicholas fandos

But the first thing that I notice as I arrive at the Capitol is that the place has been transformed overnight.

rachel quester O.K., so Nick just walked away, because he got a call from a member of Congress.

nicholas fandos

After two weeks of recess, lawmakers are back.

speaker Madam Speaker, will there be an formal vote on an impeachment inquiry? Madam Speaker?

nicholas fandos

There are even tourists wandering around through the SCIF area, running into reporters.

speaker 1 In part to keep an eye on the British. speaker 2 Yeah, it’s somewhere up there. Oh, wait. There we go.

nicholas fandos

Stopping, looking at the TV reporters, who they recognize from CNN.

speaker 1 Have you guys heard of the whole impeachment inquiry? speaker 2 Mm-hmm. speaker 3 Yeah. That’s craziness.

nicholas fandos

The press corps seems to have somehow doubled. I don’t know how, because it’s already been huge following this stuff. And there’s just kind of an energy gripping the place that comes with 535 or so lawmakers and their staff, their kind of entourages, being back, moving around the Capitol.

michael barbaro

Can any member of Congress walk into the SCIF, right by you, and actually listen to these depositions as testimony?

nicholas fandos

The answer is no. And we actually saw it a couple times this week, when Republicans tried to go in and sit in on these depositions. But they were not on the committees that are leading the investigation. And therefore, under the committee rules, they ended up getting kicked out. But with lawmakers back in town, you’re talking about three committees that are leading the impeachment investigation. That’s dozens and dozens of lawmakers that sit on those. And they can all go and sit in. And they can come out, and they’re not supposed to talk in detail about what transpired, but they can give general impressions and hints about what they heard. In one case, one Democrat came out and basically broke the rules and just talked about what was happening completely.

archived recording How did the questioning go today, Gerry? archived recording (gerry connolly) I thought it was very powerful testimony.

michael barbaro

And what did this Democrat divulge?

nicholas fandos

So he comes out and says —

archived recording (gerry connolly) Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine —

nicholas fandos

— that he’d just heard the witness in the room, a State Department official named George Kent —

archived recording (gerry connolly) — who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine.

nicholas fandos

— that he and other career diplomats who were in charge of the State Department’s policy toward Ukraine had been shoved aside —

archived recording (gerry connolly) All of the people charged with policy in Ukraine were replaced, apparently, after a May 23rd meeting at the White House organized by Mick Mulvaney, not John Bolton or Pompeo.

nicholas fandos

— and were told, starting late in the spring, that basically, their services weren’t needed anymore —

archived recording (gerry connolly) And that was wrong. He used that word, “wrong.”

nicholas fandos

— that policy towards Ukraine was going to be run by Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, and others out of the White House —

archived recording (gerry connolly) The import of this testimony is deeply disturbing, especially the role of Rudy Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

— and they may as well lay low.

michael barbaro

And what’s the significance of that?

nicholas fandos

So the significance of that is that you have here another high-level American diplomat saying that the normal channels for foreign policy that have guided American policy for quite a long time are being stepped on, basically, by the White House, which is putting their own guys in charge. And one of them that he singles out, yet again, is Gordon Sondland. Now you have a second witness, two in two days, coming forward and giving a pretty consistent account. This is all picking up a little bit of momentum.

michael barbaro

So I’m taking it you didn’t watch the Democratic debate.

nicholas fandos

I did not watch the Democratic debate, and I did not watch playoff baseball.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

nicholas fandos

What if we take a 20-minute break, and I can go and satisfy my editors a little bit by updating some stories?

michael barbaro

Yeah. All right. We’ll be back, as we say.

nicholas fandos

O.K. More soon.

clare toeniskoetter Thanks, Nick. nicholas fandos You guys going to hang here? michael barbaro Yeah. rachel quester O.K. Should we go to break there?

michael barbaro

That was the idea.

clare toeniskoetter See ya!

michael barbaro

O.K. So Wednesday.

nicholas fandos

Wednesday. Another day, another diplomat. This time, it’s a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who quit the State Department last week, reportedly because he was so frustrated by the very things that we’re talking about. He tried to raise alarms by that and didn’t get a response. And he was so fed up, he said he quit. So it’s clear after three days of testimony that we’re starting to see the diplomatic and foreign policy core, the expertise, the professional class that handles American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican administrations, basically coming one by one to tell a remarkably consistent story about how, in ways that they were uncomfortable with and they had not seen before, they were getting pushed aside. And the policy that was being executed in their place — they would say it’s not even a policy — but the actions in their place, basically, rather than, to put it in their words, the policy serving the well-being of the Ukrainians and the United States, it was serving the well-being of the president of the United States. And that was about it.

michael barbaro

But how exactly is that the basis of an impeachment inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not the fact that they were pushed aside that they see as so problematic. They’re telling a story about what happened once they were pushed aside. They think that’s created a set of conditions that led to these events that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. And that’s really what investigators are trying to get to the bottom of. And now, they’ve been able to establish how the circumstances, or the scene, was set for those things to happen by these current and former diplomats. But they still have more investigative work to flesh that out. ^CLARE TOENISKOETTER^ O.K., we’re walking up.

speaker All right. So I’m going to just watch for — nicholas fandos If that’s O.K. speaker Yeah, yeah.

nicholas fandos

So in the middle of all this on Wednesday, I meet up with my colleague, Sheryl Stolberg.

nicholas fandos Yeah, we’ll probably go to one of those tables. sheryl gay stolberg You think it’ll be a standing interview? nicholas fandos I hope not. But, you know, a guy’s got to get his steps in.

nicholas fandos

And we’re going to go upstairs into the Capitol to interview Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who chairs the Intelligence Committee and is the man at the center of all these hearings leading the impeachment investigation. We had been hoping to sit down with Schiff in his office and have a kind of quieter, more reflective meeting. But indicative of the way things are in the middle of this inquiry, his staff asked, instead, if we could meet in a reception room.

sheryl gay stolberg Let’s take this corner.

nicholas fandos

Right off the floor of the Capitol, where there were different meet-and-greets going on, and constituents were meeting with their members of Congress. And the room was buzzing and lively. And we staked out a corner where we could talk to Congressman Schiff.

adam schiff How are you doing? nicholas fandos How are you? adam schiff Good. nicholas fandos Here, and Sheryl’s over here too. sheryl gay stolberg Hi! adam schiff Hi, how are you?

nicholas fandos

And we were able to put to him some, kind of, key questions about what we thought was going on to see how he sees it.

sheryl gay stolberg You know, the president talks a lot about the deep state. Does it strike you that this is exactly what he fears, or what he thinks of as the deep state? adam schiff You know, the deep state theory used to be a fringe theory in third-world countries or kooky conspiracy theorists at home. When the president talks about the deep state, what he’s really talking about is, in particular, people that expose his wrongdoing and misconduct.

nicholas fandos

At one point, we put the question to him of what he made of all these diplomats coming forward and telling this story.

adam schiff You know, there’s no revolt, and there’s no deep state. sheryl gay stolberg I’m being —

nicholas fandos

He quibbled a little bit with the wording that Sheryl used. But he basically said, I agree with the premise of the question.

adam schiff I think it’s a very serious attack on career public servants who are unwilling to compromise themselves in the president’s service. This has to be the last question because I’ve got to go vote on the last vote. sheryl gay stolberg I have two more real quickies. Do you have enough evidence to impeach? adam schiff I’ve got to go vote. sheryl gay stolberg Can he come back or is that it? nicholas fandos I can ask.

michael barbaro

So another busy day. Where is your head as Wednesday comes to an end?

nicholas fandos

So by the end of Wednesday, it just feels inescapable that this is all building, at least this week, towards Gordon Sondland coming in himself on Thursday and giving his account of what happened, of facing questions about these various accusations and accounts that investigators have been getting all week. And figuring out, how does he explain this stuff? How does he view what was going on? And we left the Capitol Wednesday evening waiting to see exactly what he was going to say.

michael barbaro

Right. Like, if this is a play, the character that everyone’s been talking about for the last 90 minutes eventually has to come onstage and say something.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Except for, in this case, the stage is behind closed doors. And saying something, it turns out, amounts to releasing an 18-page opening statement Thursday morning right before he begins to answer questions.

nicholas fandos Hello. michael barbaro Hi. nicholas fandos Welcome. michael barbaro Very nice to see you. nicholas fandos Very nice to see you.

michael barbaro

So that’s how Thursday morning begins. I walk into the Capitol with Rachel and Clare just as, it seems, you are digesting Gordon Sondland’s opening statements.

nicholas fandos And my morning was basically spent trying to go through 18 pages of what he was going to go in there and say.

nicholas fandos

We received a copy of his opening statement. And Mike Schmidt, our colleague, and I pored through it to try and figure out, what’s new here? What’s he addressing? What does he have to say? And a couple of things jumped out at us. He basically says, in a meeting that he had with President Trump in May, not long after the new Ukrainian president is elected, President Trump basically rejected Sondland’s advice and the advice of other diplomats that were with him who said, you know, Mr. President, we think you ought to meet with this new guy. We think he’s going to do good work. Trump didn’t seem interested, and then directed them, Sondland said, to go through Rudy Giuliani, to go through his private lawyer.

michael barbaro

On Ukraine foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

He gave Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, and other high-ranking officials in the room the direct impression that he had empowered Rudy Giuliani to basically run American policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

I mean, all week we’d been hearing these career nonpartisan diplomats coming in and pointing at Gordon Sondland. And here you have Gordon Sondland turning around just as quickly and pointing at the president and Rudy Giuliani and saying, everything I did, I did because they told me to. And I didn’t always feel good about it. I don’t think Rudy Giuliani should have been involved. I think the men and women of the State Department ought to be running our foreign policy, he testified. But I have to follow the directions of the president. And I thought, more or less, that I could work within those parameters to still achieve an end that I believed in, to still help Ukraine. And he said something interesting. He says, I didn’t realize at first. It was only later that I realized that Rudy Giuliani may have had some other motivations in mind. As if all of this is not enough, one of the president’s loyal diplomats seeming to turn on him and point the finger back at him.

michael barbaro Hello. michael shear How are you? michael barbaro Mr. Shear. michael shear Good to see you.

nicholas fandos

My colleague Mike Shear walks up.

michael barbaro I’m just going to say, any email that starts with, “This will be interesting,” I want to read the rest of. michael shear Mick Mulvaney is about to give a press briefing. nicholas fandos Oh, jeez.

nicholas fandos

And says, hey, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who never addresses the press, has just scheduled a 12:30 press conference at the White House. He’s going to talk to reporters. And we think he’s going to talk about Ukraine.

michael shear But, I mean, he should get a lot of questions about this stuff, about impeachment. I mean, he’s going to the White House press briefing room.

nicholas fandos

So Mike and I go back to a press room just outside the SCIF and set up shop around his computer, where we tune into this press conference.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

rachel quester (WHISPERING) What’s happening? michael barbaro We’re with Nick Fandos and Mike Shear watching Mulvaney.

nicholas fandos

He starts to field questions. And it gets crazy really fast.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.

nicholas fandos

After this week of slow drip disclosures, and after weeks of the White House denying that there had been any kind of leverage, or quid pro quo, or exchange with the Ukrainians around the suspension of security aid for the country, he comes out and basically says — he does say, on the record, that —

archived recording So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to the Ukraine? archived recording (mick mulvaney) The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. Then that is absolutely appropriate.

nicholas fandos

The White House withheld the aid for several reasons. And one of those reasons was President Trump wanted Ukraine to first commit to investigating potential collusion between Ukrainians and Democrats in the 2016 election that was meant to undermine his campaign. And on top of it, Mulvaney says, yep, this was the deal.

archived recording Let’s be clear. What you’ve just described is a quid pro quo.

nicholas fandos

Reporters quickly call it a quid pro quo.

archived recording It is — funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well. archived recording (mick mulvaney) We do that all the time with foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

And he said, that’s fine. It happens all the time. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) If you read the news reports, and you believe them — what did McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy, that was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody, get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.

michael barbaro

I mean, that’s an extraordinary thing for the White House chief of staff to say.

nicholas fandos

It is. And he goes a little bit further. He’s asked about Rudy Giuliani and his role. And his defense, again, is essentially that the president of the United States gets to dictate foreign policy. And if he wants his personal lawyer — a guy who he’s not paying, a guy who’s doing business, by the way, in Ukraine at the same time he’s evidently doing diplomacy — to run American foreign policy, well, that’s his prerogative. Elections have consequences. And that’s O.K. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Elections do have consequences. And they should. And your foreign policy is going to change. Obama did it in one way, we’re doing it in a different way. And there’s no problem with that.

nicholas fandos

It’s a pretty stunning assertion. A pretty stunning view of executive power. It suggests the White House has not been telling the whole truth up till today.

michael barbaro

And then decided to tell it in a kind of extreme, unexpected way.

nicholas fandos

Right. It’s a little baffling to understand what exactly Mick Mulvaney was doing here.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) I’m not going to take anymore. It’s nice to see everybody. Thanks again. nicholas fandos All right, so we should — we should get on the phone. mike shear What the hell just happened? michael barbaro Why don’t you take some time to figure out what this all means? nicholas fandos There’s also probably about to be a House vote, where we may need to go and see if we can’t get some quick reaction.

nicholas fandos

You know, it was pretty evident in the hour or so after that press conference that lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn’t quite know what to make of it either.

recording^

Today, the chief of staff said what we’ve always just talked about. It was also about exonerating Russia and looking at the 2016 election.

nicholas fandos

Some said, well, they just admitted to the whole thing, I suppose. So what do we do now? Others, Adam Schiff said —

archived recording (adam schiff) It certainly indicates that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.

nicholas fandos

A story that’s very, very bad just got much, much worse.

michael barbaro

Well, to the extent, Nick, that it’s knowable, what do you make of why the White House decided to do this? It’s kind of hard to understand.

nicholas fandos

It is. We don’t know if Mulvaney was acting on his own authority, who had put him out there. The president’s legal team, one of his other lawyers who’s not Rudy Giuliani, said he hadn’t been consulted before Mulvaney went out there. You know, there has been a move that President Trump returns to time and again in his presidency. And part of me wonders if this isn’t the same thing, where, when he’s being accused of something bad, of having done something under the table or that would be deemed inappropriate for others, instead of pretending he didn’t, he just kind of throws it all out into the open and says, you know, yeah, I did this. But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. So what? Tell me it’s wrong. And I think at the end of this week, one of the biggest questions that I think emerges from all this stuff is that it’s now up to Congress, not just Democrats, but Republicans, too, to answer that question and say, is this right, or is this wrong? If he’s going to own up to most of it, and assuming that more officials come forward and fill in different pieces of this story as we’re coming to understand it, you know, can they stomach that? And is that a transgression that they’re willing to say is worthy of impeachment and worthy of his removal from office? I mean, it’s kind of on the president’s part, potentially, the ultimate high-stakes bluff, and I don’t think we know yet where things are going to fall out.

[music]

nicholas fandos

I think what we’re left with at the end of this week is, like, a question. Is this a story of a bunch of career diplomats, who have never really much liked President Trump or his policies, rebelling against him? And I don’t think that they really see it that way. From their perspective, you know, they’re used to having policy differences with presidents of both parties. They’re trained to implement the policies of Republicans and of Democrats. What I think is different, what is leading otherwise anonymous officials to blow the whistle, to march up to Capitol Hill and walk down all those flights of steps to the House SCIF and tell the story as they see it, is that they see this as something fundamentally different, and, importantly, as a part of their responsibility as permanent agents of the government, of people who are working on behalf of the American people, not a particular president, and that only when things seem to get so bad did they decide they needed to speak up.

michael barbaro

Nick, thank you for essentially giving us your entire week. We appreciate it.

nicholas fandos

It was a pleasure to have the company.

michael barbaro

It can get lonely in front of a SCIF, I imagine. Anyway, thank you, truly.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, I’m glad you guys were here. It’s been quite a story.

michael barbaro

The rest — so on Thursday night, there was a huge bipartisan outcry, and the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, tries to walk back his comments about a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He issues a statement essentially denying what he has said just a few hours earlier. And I’m going to read you the quote. He said, “Let me be clear. There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.” We’ll be right back.

sheryl gay stolberg How does it sound? michael barbaro It sounds pretty good. sheryl gay stolberg Sound O.K.? michael barbaro I’ve never actually produced a bit of — any audio on my own. So this is a bit of an experiment. sheryl gay stolberg O.K., great. michael barbaro And I think this is definitely the first time we have done the headlines of “The Daily” inside the Senate press gallery. So Sheryl Stolberg — oh, I think, I’m supposed to hold this to my own mouth.

michael barbaro

So Sheryl, what do we need to know today?

sheryl gay stolberg

So it was a really busy news day.

archived recording (mike pence) Today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdogan in Turkey and the United States of America that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.

sheryl gay stolberg

Vice President Pence flew to Turkey, and on Thursday afternoon, he announced that Turkey had agreed to a cease-fire in which the Turkish government would suspend its military operations in northern Syria for five days in order to give the Kurds time to clear the area. So that raises the question, is this a breakthrough, or is this just giving Turkey what it wants in the first place, because they wanted the Kurds out?

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording Will you support this deal? What do you think of it? archived recording (jeremy corbyn) Well, from what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or our expectations.

sheryl gay stolberg

There’s finally a deal for Brexit that the European Union and Britain both think will work. But it’s not clear if it’s going to pass, because it has to go through Parliament, and the Labour Party has already said it’s opposed.

archived recording (jeremy corbyn) We are unhappy with this deal, and as it stands, we’ll vote against it.

sheryl gay stolberg

And finally, on Thursday, it was a sad day here in the Capitol, because Representative Elijah Cummings, a towering figure in the House, died. Cummings was a son of sharecroppers. His own presence here was really a miracle to him.

archived recording (elijah cummings) My father had never been in the Capitol building. He said, isn’t this the place where they used to call us slaves? I said, yes sir. And isn’t this the place they used to call us three-fifths of a man? I said, yes, sir. And isn’t this the place that they used to call us chattel? I say, yes, yes, yes, sir. And I’ll never forget, he said, when I think about you being sworn in today, he said, now I see what I could have been if I had had an opportunity.

sheryl gay stolberg

And over the last year, as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he had been a central figure in the investigations of the president, and in his role in these investigations, he continually pleaded for decency.

archived recording (elijah cummings) We are better than this. We are so much — we really are. As a country, we are so much better than this. And I’m hoping that all of us can get back to this democracy that we want and that we should be passing on to our children so that they can do better than what we did.

michael barbaro

Sheryl, thank you.

sheryl gay stolberg

Thank you, Michael.

clare toeniskoetter We’re walking out?

Hey, we’re here to get press credentials? We’re from The New York Times. All right. We’re in the House. So we’re in a — oh, watch out, people are coming. The House speaker is walking by with a very significant entourage. That was Nancy Pelosi. That was cool. O.K. So what are we doing? Oh, we’re waiting for Nick to get off the phone. clare toeniskoetter We also could say hi. michael barbaro I have a croissant I’d like to finish.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

speaker Are you going to bring him in for a deposition?

michael barbaro

Today —

speaker 1 Nothing further at this moment. speaker 2 Does this move the ball for impeachment, in your mind?

michael barbaro

A week inside the U.S. Capitol as the impeachment inquiry enters a pivotal phase. It’s Friday, October 18.

nicholas fandos There’s a bunch of rooms, so — michael barbaro O.K. clare toeniskoetter What’s going on? michael barbaro We’re just trying to find a room that is quiet enough to make an episode of “The Daily.” nicholas fandos I think this will work.

michael barbaro

O.K. Here we go. Nick Fandos, you’ve been on the Hill all week. Walk me through this. What does the impeachment inquiry actually look like on the ground?

nicholas fandos

Yeah. So, I mean, the crazy thing is that the house opened this impeachment inquiry a little more than three weeks ago now on their way out of town for a two-week recess. So members were scattered all over the country, meeting with constituents, holding town halls, while back here in the Capitol, a core group of staff members, basically, for the House Intelligence Committee and a couple of others, stuck around and began issuing subpoenas and requests, setting up the very first witness depositions for their investigation. And so this week was the week that five of those depositions, one a day, were lined up, and lawmakers were going to be coming back. So that’s kind of what I was expecting when I arrived at the Capitol on Monday.

rachel quester Hello. nicholas fandos Hey, it’s Nick. rachel quester Hi, how’s it going?

nicholas fandos

And I met up with our colleagues from “The Daily,” Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter, who were going to spend the week with me.

nicholas fandos It’s so nice outside. rachel quester It’s so nice outside.

nicholas fandos

We had to meet up outside of the Capitol because it was Columbus Day, actually. The press galleries and all the functional staff were not working here. So I had to escort them in specially. We walked inside and down three sets of stairs.

clare toeniskoetter Where are we? nicholas fandos We’re standing now beside the doors to the House Intelligence Committee SCIF.

nicholas fandos

And at the bottom of those stairs, we end up at the secured rooms, we call it the SCIF, of the House Intelligence Committee —

clare toeniskoetter Wait, SCIF? Secure — nicholas fandos Compartmentalized Information Facility.

nicholas fandos

— which is one of the most secretive in Congress. It’s where this investigation is taking place, all behind closed doors.

nicholas fandos And they have these red stickers on them, which get photographed all the time and are always in the newspaper, which just say “restricted area.” You can’t go there.

nicholas fandos

So the three of us and a bunch of reporters were gathered around outside, basically waiting for any emissaries to come out of the room and give some sense of what was going on back there with the very first witness deposition.

nicholas fandos We spend all day trying to mentally pierce that barrier.

michael barbaro

So it says something about this week that this room is where Congress is holding these hearings.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, that’s right. I mean, it’s entirely outside of the public view. This is an investigation that could result in an attempt to remove President Trump. And the earliest stages of the investigation, at least, are all being conducted out of public view. And this has been a source of some contention early on.

archived recording (jim jordan) The first two interviews, totalling approximately 20 hours, not one single thing was said in those respective interviews that the American people should not be able to see, should not be able to hear.

nicholas fandos

Republicans have really seized on it to accuse Democrats of, basically, trying to impeach Trump in private —

archived recording (jim jordan) The tragedy here, and the crime here, is that the American people don’t get to see what’s going on in these sessions.

nicholas fandos

— of hiding important work from the American people and from the press, who might be able to evaluate it. And the Democrats argue, though, that basically, this is investigative best practice. That, unlike past impeachments, they don’t already know what the story is. They need to find out the details. And the best way to investigate it is in private, where witnesses can’t line up their stories by hearing what somebody else testified, where lawyers can ask most of the questions, rather than lawmakers who are, maybe, trying to fundraise off of some quip, or speak to their constituents at a public hearing. And this allows them, ideally, to move quickly and collect a lot of information efficiently. And then, they figure out, what have we found? And what is the best of what we’ve got? And they move that, then, into the public sphere. And they present that evidence, they invite their best witnesses to come and testify, and they can kind of control the story that they’re building against the president.

michael barbaro

Much like a prosecutor, or a district attorney, quietly builds a case, makes an announcement of whether or not there’s an indictment, and then goes to trial.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. The rub, of course, is that this is Congress. And politicians love to blab. They get information that looks damaging to the president. If you’re a Democrat, you’d love for that to get out.

michael barbaro

So what’s the situation on Monday when it comes to these hearings? What’s actually happening in that SCIF, behind those closed doors?

nicholas fandos

So for most of the day Monday, all I know is that this former White House official, Fiona Hill, is in there testifying. And it’s hour after hour after hour. There’s very little information coming out. My feet are getting sore.

nicholas fandos Hey. Are you still free?

nicholas fandos

Chit-chatting with other reporters. Basically waiting for any kind of emissary to come out of the room and give us a sense of what’s going on.

nicholas fandos It seems pretty quiet. I think Schiff just left to go — he’s speaking at the 92nd Street Y.

michael barbaro

You’re just spending the day standing outside this room.

nicholas fandos

Right.

nicholas fandos [SIGHS] clare toeniskoetter How many hours do you think you’ve spent standing, waiting, doing nothing so far? nicholas fandos I don’t know. Probably north of 30 hours, 35 hours. But it’ll get worse.

nicholas fandos

And it was a long day. And, eventually, the sun goes down. Fiona Hill is still not done. And she finally leaves at about 8 o’clock.

clare toeniskoetter Bye, thank you!

nicholas fandos

I just kind of had to go home. Because there was not a whole lot more reporting to do here.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

nicholas fandos

And it was only as I was walking back up to my apartment building that I started hearing from some sources and being able to piece together, over the next couple of hours, what had actually happened that day. And the testimony, it turns out, was pretty remarkable.

michael barbaro

What was the testimony?

nicholas fandos

So you’ve got to keep in mind, Fiona Hill is a respected career Russia expert who was brought in to the Trump administration to work for John Bolton on the National Security Council as one of the president’s top advisers on Europe and Russia policy. So she’s right at the center of traditional decision making around policy towards Ukraine. And the account that she gives is that there was a meeting earlier this summer in July where several other diplomats, including Gordon Sondland, a former Trump donor who had become ambassador to the European Union, met with some Ukrainian officials. And she tells lawmakers that this meeting veered dangerously off course, from her perspective, and that she and her boss, John Bolton, were so alarmed by what was said that Bolton told her, you need to go to White House lawyers right now and tell them that we’re not part of, and this was a quote, “whatever drug deal” these guys are cooking up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

Not a literal drug deal. But what Bolton and Hill thought was going on is that Sondland and the president’s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were basically holding out from the Ukrainians a White House meeting with President Trump, which is what they wanted, as leverage for the Ukrainians agreeing to investigate Democrats and Democratic issues that could benefit the president politically. Hill also testified that, at one point, Bolton referred to Giuliani as a “hand grenade” that’s “going to blow everybody up.” And so we were able to basically pull together this and some other elements of the story and publish it, I think, about 10:30 at night, and really be able to tell the story of day one behind those closed doors.

michael barbaro

So beyond this being a very juicy scoop, what’s the significance of the testimony that Fiona Hill gave? What does it do for the inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So there are a couple things that I would say. One is that she implicates her boss, John Bolton, who is a boldface name in Washington. He’s the president’s top national security adviser. And saying that high up in the chain, the president’s national security adviser is calling this a “drug deal,” was so concerned about this he had me go to the lawyers — and it kind of opened the door to the fact that this set of events that we’re learning about in retrospect were setting off alarms in real time, and at very high levels of the government. The other aspect of it, though, is that I’m looking ahead to the rest of the week, and it seems pretty clear she’s not going to be the last person. Unlike in past investigations, where the White House has successfully shut down Congress, important witnesses are coming, and they’re going to talk, and they’re going to tell their story. We’re actually going to understand what happened here.

michael barbaro

Nick, I guess I just have, like, a collegial inquiry here. What’s the point of standing around all day if you end up getting the best stuff when you get home at, like, 10 o’clock at night?

nicholas fandos

[LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Doesn’t that suggest that maybe you’re not going about this in the most efficient way?

nicholas fandos

Uhh, it’s a fair point. But we do learn some pretty significant details that set the stage for the rest of the week.

michael barbaro

O.K. So what happens the next day, on Tuesday?

rachel quester Ready for day two. clare toeniskoetter Yeah.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday, we know that there is going to be another one of these closed-door depositions that’s probably going to go on again for hours, this time with a senior State Department official who was more or less in charge of Ukraine policy for the State Department.

speaker 1 So Julie’s group, we’re going to gather up. Make sure we have everybody. I don’t see Brian. speaker 2 I don’t either.

nicholas fandos

But the first thing that I notice as I arrive at the Capitol is that the place has been transformed overnight.

rachel quester O.K., so Nick just walked away, because he got a call from a member of Congress.

nicholas fandos

After two weeks of recess, lawmakers are back.

speaker Madam Speaker, will there be an formal vote on an impeachment inquiry? Madam Speaker?

nicholas fandos

There are even tourists wandering around through the SCIF area, running into reporters.

speaker 1 In part to keep an eye on the British. speaker 2 Yeah, it’s somewhere up there. Oh, wait. There we go.

nicholas fandos

Stopping, looking at the TV reporters, who they recognize from CNN.

speaker 1 Have you guys heard of the whole impeachment inquiry? speaker 2 Mm-hmm. speaker 3 Yeah. That’s craziness.

nicholas fandos

The press corps seems to have somehow doubled. I don’t know how, because it’s already been huge following this stuff. And there’s just kind of an energy gripping the place that comes with 535 or so lawmakers and their staff, their kind of entourages, being back, moving around the Capitol.

michael barbaro

Can any member of Congress walk into the SCIF, right by you, and actually listen to these depositions as testimony?

nicholas fandos

The answer is no. And we actually saw it a couple times this week, when Republicans tried to go in and sit in on these depositions. But they were not on the committees that are leading the investigation. And therefore, under the committee rules, they ended up getting kicked out. But with lawmakers back in town, you’re talking about three committees that are leading the impeachment investigation. That’s dozens and dozens of lawmakers that sit on those. And they can all go and sit in. And they can come out, and they’re not supposed to talk in detail about what transpired, but they can give general impressions and hints about what they heard. In one case, one Democrat came out and basically broke the rules and just talked about what was happening completely.

archived recording How did the questioning go today, Gerry? archived recording (gerry connolly) I thought it was very powerful testimony.

michael barbaro

And what did this Democrat divulge?

nicholas fandos

So he comes out and says —

archived recording (gerry connolly) Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine —

nicholas fandos

— that he’d just heard the witness in the room, a State Department official named George Kent —

archived recording (gerry connolly) — who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine.

nicholas fandos

— that he and other career diplomats who were in charge of the State Department’s policy toward Ukraine had been shoved aside —

archived recording (gerry connolly) All of the people charged with policy in Ukraine were replaced, apparently, after a May 23rd meeting at the White House organized by Mick Mulvaney, not John Bolton or Pompeo.

nicholas fandos

— and were told, starting late in the spring, that basically, their services weren’t needed anymore —

archived recording (gerry connolly) And that was wrong. He used that word, “wrong.”

nicholas fandos

— that policy towards Ukraine was going to be run by Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, and others out of the White House —

archived recording (gerry connolly) The import of this testimony is deeply disturbing, especially the role of Rudy Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

— and they may as well lay low.

michael barbaro

And what’s the significance of that?

nicholas fandos

So the significance of that is that you have here another high-level American diplomat saying that the normal channels for foreign policy that have guided American policy for quite a long time are being stepped on, basically, by the White House, which is putting their own guys in charge. And one of them that he singles out, yet again, is Gordon Sondland. Now you have a second witness, two in two days, coming forward and giving a pretty consistent account. This is all picking up a little bit of momentum.

michael barbaro

So I’m taking it you didn’t watch the Democratic debate.

nicholas fandos

I did not watch the Democratic debate, and I did not watch playoff baseball.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

nicholas fandos

What if we take a 20-minute break, and I can go and satisfy my editors a little bit by updating some stories?

michael barbaro

Yeah. All right. We’ll be back, as we say.

nicholas fandos

O.K. More soon.

clare toeniskoetter Thanks, Nick. nicholas fandos You guys going to hang here? michael barbaro Yeah. rachel quester O.K. Should we go to break there?

michael barbaro

That was the idea.

clare toeniskoetter See ya!

michael barbaro

O.K. So Wednesday.

nicholas fandos

Wednesday. Another day, another diplomat. This time, it’s a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who quit the State Department last week, reportedly because he was so frustrated by the very things that we’re talking about. He tried to raise alarms by that and didn’t get a response. And he was so fed up, he said he quit. So it’s clear after three days of testimony that we’re starting to see the diplomatic and foreign policy core, the expertise, the professional class that handles American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican administrations, basically coming one by one to tell a remarkably consistent story about how, in ways that they were uncomfortable with and they had not seen before, they were getting pushed aside. And the policy that was being executed in their place — they would say it’s not even a policy — but the actions in their place, basically, rather than, to put it in their words, the policy serving the well-being of the Ukrainians and the United States, it was serving the well-being of the president of the United States. And that was about it.

michael barbaro

But how exactly is that the basis of an impeachment inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not the fact that they were pushed aside that they see as so problematic. They’re telling a story about what happened once they were pushed aside. They think that’s created a set of conditions that led to these events that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. And that’s really what investigators are trying to get to the bottom of. And now, they’ve been able to establish how the circumstances, or the scene, was set for those things to happen by these current and former diplomats. But they still have more investigative work to flesh that out. ^CLARE TOENISKOETTER^ O.K., we’re walking up.

speaker All right. So I’m going to just watch for — nicholas fandos If that’s O.K. speaker Yeah, yeah.

nicholas fandos

So in the middle of all this on Wednesday, I meet up with my colleague, Sheryl Stolberg.

nicholas fandos Yeah, we’ll probably go to one of those tables. sheryl gay stolberg You think it’ll be a standing interview? nicholas fandos I hope not. But, you know, a guy’s got to get his steps in.

nicholas fandos

And we’re going to go upstairs into the Capitol to interview Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who chairs the Intelligence Committee and is the man at the center of all these hearings leading the impeachment investigation. We had been hoping to sit down with Schiff in his office and have a kind of quieter, more reflective meeting. But indicative of the way things are in the middle of this inquiry, his staff asked, instead, if we could meet in a reception room.

sheryl gay stolberg Let’s take this corner.

nicholas fandos

Right off the floor of the Capitol, where there were different meet-and-greets going on, and constituents were meeting with their members of Congress. And the room was buzzing and lively. And we staked out a corner where we could talk to Congressman Schiff.

adam schiff How are you doing? nicholas fandos How are you? adam schiff Good. nicholas fandos Here, and Sheryl’s over here too. sheryl gay stolberg Hi! adam schiff Hi, how are you?

nicholas fandos

And we were able to put to him some, kind of, key questions about what we thought was going on to see how he sees it.

sheryl gay stolberg You know, the president talks a lot about the deep state. Does it strike you that this is exactly what he fears, or what he thinks of as the deep state? adam schiff You know, the deep state theory used to be a fringe theory in third-world countries or kooky conspiracy theorists at home. When the president talks about the deep state, what he’s really talking about is, in particular, people that expose his wrongdoing and misconduct.

nicholas fandos

At one point, we put the question to him of what he made of all these diplomats coming forward and telling this story.

adam schiff You know, there’s no revolt, and there’s no deep state. sheryl gay stolberg I’m being —

nicholas fandos

He quibbled a little bit with the wording that Sheryl used. But he basically said, I agree with the premise of the question.

adam schiff I think it’s a very serious attack on career public servants who are unwilling to compromise themselves in the president’s service. This has to be the last question because I’ve got to go vote on the last vote. sheryl gay stolberg I have two more real quickies. Do you have enough evidence to impeach? adam schiff I’ve got to go vote. sheryl gay stolberg Can he come back or is that it? nicholas fandos I can ask.

michael barbaro

So another busy day. Where is your head as Wednesday comes to an end?

nicholas fandos

So by the end of Wednesday, it just feels inescapable that this is all building, at least this week, towards Gordon Sondland coming in himself on Thursday and giving his account of what happened, of facing questions about these various accusations and accounts that investigators have been getting all week. And figuring out, how does he explain this stuff? How does he view what was going on? And we left the Capitol Wednesday evening waiting to see exactly what he was going to say.

michael barbaro

Right. Like, if this is a play, the character that everyone’s been talking about for the last 90 minutes eventually has to come onstage and say something.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Except for, in this case, the stage is behind closed doors. And saying something, it turns out, amounts to releasing an 18-page opening statement Thursday morning right before he begins to answer questions.

nicholas fandos Hello. michael barbaro Hi. nicholas fandos Welcome. michael barbaro Very nice to see you. nicholas fandos Very nice to see you.

michael barbaro

So that’s how Thursday morning begins. I walk into the Capitol with Rachel and Clare just as, it seems, you are digesting Gordon Sondland’s opening statements.

nicholas fandos And my morning was basically spent trying to go through 18 pages of what he was going to go in there and say.

nicholas fandos

We received a copy of his opening statement. And Mike Schmidt, our colleague, and I pored through it to try and figure out, what’s new here? What’s he addressing? What does he have to say? And a couple of things jumped out at us. He basically says, in a meeting that he had with President Trump in May, not long after the new Ukrainian president is elected, President Trump basically rejected Sondland’s advice and the advice of other diplomats that were with him who said, you know, Mr. President, we think you ought to meet with this new guy. We think he’s going to do good work. Trump didn’t seem interested, and then directed them, Sondland said, to go through Rudy Giuliani, to go through his private lawyer.

michael barbaro

On Ukraine foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

He gave Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, and other high-ranking officials in the room the direct impression that he had empowered Rudy Giuliani to basically run American policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

I mean, all week we’d been hearing these career nonpartisan diplomats coming in and pointing at Gordon Sondland. And here you have Gordon Sondland turning around just as quickly and pointing at the president and Rudy Giuliani and saying, everything I did, I did because they told me to. And I didn’t always feel good about it. I don’t think Rudy Giuliani should have been involved. I think the men and women of the State Department ought to be running our foreign policy, he testified. But I have to follow the directions of the president. And I thought, more or less, that I could work within those parameters to still achieve an end that I believed in, to still help Ukraine. And he said something interesting. He says, I didn’t realize at first. It was only later that I realized that Rudy Giuliani may have had some other motivations in mind. As if all of this is not enough, one of the president’s loyal diplomats seeming to turn on him and point the finger back at him.

michael barbaro Hello. michael shear How are you? michael barbaro Mr. Shear. michael shear Good to see you.

nicholas fandos

My colleague Mike Shear walks up.

michael barbaro I’m just going to say, any email that starts with, “This will be interesting,” I want to read the rest of. michael shear Mick Mulvaney is about to give a press briefing. nicholas fandos Oh, jeez.

nicholas fandos

And says, hey, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who never addresses the press, has just scheduled a 12:30 press conference at the White House. He’s going to talk to reporters. And we think he’s going to talk about Ukraine.

michael shear But, I mean, he should get a lot of questions about this stuff, about impeachment. I mean, he’s going to the White House press briefing room.

nicholas fandos

So Mike and I go back to a press room just outside the SCIF and set up shop around his computer, where we tune into this press conference.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

rachel quester (WHISPERING) What’s happening? michael barbaro We’re with Nick Fandos and Mike Shear watching Mulvaney.

nicholas fandos

He starts to field questions. And it gets crazy really fast.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.

nicholas fandos

After this week of slow drip disclosures, and after weeks of the White House denying that there had been any kind of leverage, or quid pro quo, or exchange with the Ukrainians around the suspension of security aid for the country, he comes out and basically says — he does say, on the record, that —

archived recording So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to the Ukraine? archived recording (mick mulvaney) The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. Then that is absolutely appropriate.

nicholas fandos

The White House withheld the aid for several reasons. And one of those reasons was President Trump wanted Ukraine to first commit to investigating potential collusion between Ukrainians and Democrats in the 2016 election that was meant to undermine his campaign. And on top of it, Mulvaney says, yep, this was the deal.

archived recording Let’s be clear. What you’ve just described is a quid pro quo.

nicholas fandos

Reporters quickly call it a quid pro quo.

archived recording It is — funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well. archived recording (mick mulvaney) We do that all the time with foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

And he said, that’s fine. It happens all the time. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) If you read the news reports, and you believe them — what did McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy, that was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody, get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.

michael barbaro

I mean, that’s an extraordinary thing for the White House chief of staff to say.

nicholas fandos

It is. And he goes a little bit further. He’s asked about Rudy Giuliani and his role. And his defense, again, is essentially that the president of the United States gets to dictate foreign policy. And if he wants his personal lawyer — a guy who he’s not paying, a guy who’s doing business, by the way, in Ukraine at the same time he’s evidently doing diplomacy — to run American foreign policy, well, that’s his prerogative. Elections have consequences. And that’s O.K. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Elections do have consequences. And they should. And your foreign policy is going to change. Obama did it in one way, we’re doing it in a different way. And there’s no problem with that.

nicholas fandos

It’s a pretty stunning assertion. A pretty stunning view of executive power. It suggests the White House has not been telling the whole truth up till today.

michael barbaro

And then decided to tell it in a kind of extreme, unexpected way.

nicholas fandos

Right. It’s a little baffling to understand what exactly Mick Mulvaney was doing here.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) I’m not going to take anymore. It’s nice to see everybody. Thanks again. nicholas fandos All right, so we should — we should get on the phone. mike shear What the hell just happened? michael barbaro Why don’t you take some time to figure out what this all means? nicholas fandos There’s also probably about to be a House vote, where we may need to go and see if we can’t get some quick reaction.

nicholas fandos

You know, it was pretty evident in the hour or so after that press conference that lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn’t quite know what to make of it either.

recording^

Today, the chief of staff said what we’ve always just talked about. It was also about exonerating Russia and looking at the 2016 election.

nicholas fandos

Some said, well, they just admitted to the whole thing, I suppose. So what do we do now? Others, Adam Schiff said —

archived recording (adam schiff) It certainly indicates that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.

nicholas fandos

A story that’s very, very bad just got much, much worse.

michael barbaro

Well, to the extent, Nick, that it’s knowable, what do you make of why the White House decided to do this? It’s kind of hard to understand.

nicholas fandos

It is. We don’t know if Mulvaney was acting on his own authority, who had put him out there. The president’s legal team, one of his other lawyers who’s not Rudy Giuliani, said he hadn’t been consulted before Mulvaney went out there. You know, there has been a move that President Trump returns to time and again in his presidency. And part of me wonders if this isn’t the same thing, where, when he’s being accused of something bad, of having done something under the table or that would be deemed inappropriate for others, instead of pretending he didn’t, he just kind of throws it all out into the open and says, you know, yeah, I did this. But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. So what? Tell me it’s wrong. And I think at the end of this week, one of the biggest questions that I think emerges from all this stuff is that it’s now up to Congress, not just Democrats, but Republicans, too, to answer that question and say, is this right, or is this wrong? If he’s going to own up to most of it, and assuming that more officials come forward and fill in different pieces of this story as we’re coming to understand it, you know, can they stomach that? And is that a transgression that they’re willing to say is worthy of impeachment and worthy of his removal from office? I mean, it’s kind of on the president’s part, potentially, the ultimate high-stakes bluff, and I don’t think we know yet where things are going to fall out.

[music]

nicholas fandos

I think what we’re left with at the end of this week is, like, a question. Is this a story of a bunch of career diplomats, who have never really much liked President Trump or his policies, rebelling against him? And I don’t think that they really see it that way. From their perspective, you know, they’re used to having policy differences with presidents of both parties. They’re trained to implement the policies of Republicans and of Democrats. What I think is different, what is leading otherwise anonymous officials to blow the whistle, to march up to Capitol Hill and walk down all those flights of steps to the House SCIF and tell the story as they see it, is that they see this as something fundamentally different, and, importantly, as a part of their responsibility as permanent agents of the government, of people who are working on behalf of the American people, not a particular president, and that only when things seem to get so bad did they decide they needed to speak up.

michael barbaro

Nick, thank you for essentially giving us your entire week. We appreciate it.

nicholas fandos

It was a pleasure to have the company.

michael barbaro

It can get lonely in front of a SCIF, I imagine. Anyway, thank you, truly.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, I’m glad you guys were here. It’s been quite a story.

michael barbaro

The rest — so on Thursday night, there was a huge bipartisan outcry, and the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, tries to walk back his comments about a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He issues a statement essentially denying what he has said just a few hours earlier. And I’m going to read you the quote. He said, “Let me be clear. There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.” We’ll be right back.

sheryl gay stolberg How does it sound? michael barbaro It sounds pretty good. sheryl gay stolberg Sound O.K.? michael barbaro I’ve never actually produced a bit of — any audio on my own. So this is a bit of an experiment. sheryl gay stolberg O.K., great. michael barbaro And I think this is definitely the first time we have done the headlines of “The Daily” inside the Senate press gallery. So Sheryl Stolberg — oh, I think, I’m supposed to hold this to my own mouth.

michael barbaro

So Sheryl, what do we need to know today?

sheryl gay stolberg

So it was a really busy news day.

archived recording (mike pence) Today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdogan in Turkey and the United States of America that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.

sheryl gay stolberg

Vice President Pence flew to Turkey, and on Thursday afternoon, he announced that Turkey had agreed to a cease-fire in which the Turkish government would suspend its military operations in northern Syria for five days in order to give the Kurds time to clear the area. So that raises the question, is this a breakthrough, or is this just giving Turkey what it wants in the first place, because they wanted the Kurds out?

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording Will you support this deal? What do you think of it? archived recording (jeremy corbyn) Well, from what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or our expectations.

sheryl gay stolberg

There’s finally a deal for Brexit that the European Union and Britain both think will work. But it’s not clear if it’s going to pass, because it has to go through Parliament, and the Labour Party has already said it’s opposed.

archived recording (jeremy corbyn) We are unhappy with this deal, and as it stands, we’ll vote against it.

sheryl gay stolberg

And finally, on Thursday, it was a sad day here in the Capitol, because Representative Elijah Cummings, a towering figure in the House, died. Cummings was a son of sharecroppers. His own presence here was really a miracle to him.

archived recording (elijah cummings) My father had never been in the Capitol building. He said, isn’t this the place where they used to call us slaves? I said, yes sir. And isn’t this the place they used to call us three-fifths of a man? I said, yes, sir. And isn’t this the place that they used to call us chattel? I say, yes, yes, yes, sir. And I’ll never forget, he said, when I think about you being sworn in today, he said, now I see what I could have been if I had had an opportunity.

sheryl gay stolberg

And over the last year, as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he had been a central figure in the investigations of the president, and in his role in these investigations, he continually pleaded for decency.

archived recording (elijah cummings) We are better than this. We are so much — we really are. As a country, we are so much better than this. And I’m hoping that all of us can get back to this democracy that we want and that we should be passing on to our children so that they can do better than what we did.

michael barbaro

Sheryl, thank you.

sheryl gay stolberg

Thank you, Michael.

clare toeniskoetter We’re walking out?

Oh, we’re waiting for Nick to get off the phone. clare toeniskoetter We also could say hi. michael barbaro I have a croissant I’d like to finish.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

speaker Are you going to bring him in for a deposition?

michael barbaro

Today —

speaker 1 Nothing further at this moment. speaker 2 Does this move the ball for impeachment, in your mind?

michael barbaro

A week inside the U.S. Capitol as the impeachment inquiry enters a pivotal phase. It’s Friday, October 18.

nicholas fandos There’s a bunch of rooms, so — michael barbaro O.K. clare toeniskoetter What’s going on? michael barbaro We’re just trying to find a room that is quiet enough to make an episode of “The Daily.” nicholas fandos I think this will work.

michael barbaro

O.K. Here we go. Nick Fandos, you’ve been on the Hill all week. Walk me through this. What does the impeachment inquiry actually look like on the ground?

nicholas fandos

Yeah. So, I mean, the crazy thing is that the house opened this impeachment inquiry a little more than three weeks ago now on their way out of town for a two-week recess. So members were scattered all over the country, meeting with constituents, holding town halls, while back here in the Capitol, a core group of staff members, basically, for the House Intelligence Committee and a couple of others, stuck around and began issuing subpoenas and requests, setting up the very first witness depositions for their investigation. And so this week was the week that five of those depositions, one a day, were lined up, and lawmakers were going to be coming back. So that’s kind of what I was expecting when I arrived at the Capitol on Monday.

rachel quester Hello. nicholas fandos Hey, it’s Nick. rachel quester Hi, how’s it going?

nicholas fandos

And I met up with our colleagues from “The Daily,” Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter, who were going to spend the week with me.

nicholas fandos It’s so nice outside. rachel quester It’s so nice outside.

nicholas fandos

We had to meet up outside of the Capitol because it was Columbus Day, actually. The press galleries and all the functional staff were not working here. So I had to escort them in specially. We walked inside and down three sets of stairs.

clare toeniskoetter Where are we? nicholas fandos We’re standing now beside the doors to the House Intelligence Committee SCIF.

nicholas fandos

And at the bottom of those stairs, we end up at the secured rooms, we call it the SCIF, of the House Intelligence Committee —

clare toeniskoetter Wait, SCIF? Secure — nicholas fandos Compartmentalized Information Facility.

nicholas fandos

— which is one of the most secretive in Congress. It’s where this investigation is taking place, all behind closed doors.

nicholas fandos And they have these red stickers on them, which get photographed all the time and are always in the newspaper, which just say “restricted area.” You can’t go there.

nicholas fandos

So the three of us and a bunch of reporters were gathered around outside, basically waiting for any emissaries to come out of the room and give some sense of what was going on back there with the very first witness deposition.

nicholas fandos We spend all day trying to mentally pierce that barrier.

michael barbaro

So it says something about this week that this room is where Congress is holding these hearings.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, that’s right. I mean, it’s entirely outside of the public view. This is an investigation that could result in an attempt to remove President Trump. And the earliest stages of the investigation, at least, are all being conducted out of public view. And this has been a source of some contention early on.

archived recording (jim jordan) The first two interviews, totalling approximately 20 hours, not one single thing was said in those respective interviews that the American people should not be able to see, should not be able to hear.

nicholas fandos

Republicans have really seized on it to accuse Democrats of, basically, trying to impeach Trump in private —

archived recording (jim jordan) The tragedy here, and the crime here, is that the American people don’t get to see what’s going on in these sessions.

nicholas fandos

— of hiding important work from the American people and from the press, who might be able to evaluate it. And the Democrats argue, though, that basically, this is investigative best practice. That, unlike past impeachments, they don’t already know what the story is. They need to find out the details. And the best way to investigate it is in private, where witnesses can’t line up their stories by hearing what somebody else testified, where lawyers can ask most of the questions, rather than lawmakers who are, maybe, trying to fundraise off of some quip, or speak to their constituents at a public hearing. And this allows them, ideally, to move quickly and collect a lot of information efficiently. And then, they figure out, what have we found? And what is the best of what we’ve got? And they move that, then, into the public sphere. And they present that evidence, they invite their best witnesses to come and testify, and they can kind of control the story that they’re building against the president.

michael barbaro

Much like a prosecutor, or a district attorney, quietly builds a case, makes an announcement of whether or not there’s an indictment, and then goes to trial.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. The rub, of course, is that this is Congress. And politicians love to blab. They get information that looks damaging to the president. If you’re a Democrat, you’d love for that to get out.

michael barbaro

So what’s the situation on Monday when it comes to these hearings? What’s actually happening in that SCIF, behind those closed doors?

nicholas fandos

So for most of the day Monday, all I know is that this former White House official, Fiona Hill, is in there testifying. And it’s hour after hour after hour. There’s very little information coming out. My feet are getting sore.

nicholas fandos Hey. Are you still free?

nicholas fandos

Chit-chatting with other reporters. Basically waiting for any kind of emissary to come out of the room and give us a sense of what’s going on.

nicholas fandos It seems pretty quiet. I think Schiff just left to go — he’s speaking at the 92nd Street Y.

michael barbaro

You’re just spending the day standing outside this room.

nicholas fandos

Right.

nicholas fandos [SIGHS] clare toeniskoetter How many hours do you think you’ve spent standing, waiting, doing nothing so far? nicholas fandos I don’t know. Probably north of 30 hours, 35 hours. But it’ll get worse.

nicholas fandos

And it was a long day. And, eventually, the sun goes down. Fiona Hill is still not done. And she finally leaves at about 8 o’clock.

clare toeniskoetter Bye, thank you!

nicholas fandos

I just kind of had to go home. Because there was not a whole lot more reporting to do here.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

nicholas fandos

And it was only as I was walking back up to my apartment building that I started hearing from some sources and being able to piece together, over the next couple of hours, what had actually happened that day. And the testimony, it turns out, was pretty remarkable.

michael barbaro

What was the testimony?

nicholas fandos

So you’ve got to keep in mind, Fiona Hill is a respected career Russia expert who was brought in to the Trump administration to work for John Bolton on the National Security Council as one of the president’s top advisers on Europe and Russia policy. So she’s right at the center of traditional decision making around policy towards Ukraine. And the account that she gives is that there was a meeting earlier this summer in July where several other diplomats, including Gordon Sondland, a former Trump donor who had become ambassador to the European Union, met with some Ukrainian officials. And she tells lawmakers that this meeting veered dangerously off course, from her perspective, and that she and her boss, John Bolton, were so alarmed by what was said that Bolton told her, you need to go to White House lawyers right now and tell them that we’re not part of, and this was a quote, “whatever drug deal” these guys are cooking up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

Not a literal drug deal. But what Bolton and Hill thought was going on is that Sondland and the president’s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were basically holding out from the Ukrainians a White House meeting with President Trump, which is what they wanted, as leverage for the Ukrainians agreeing to investigate Democrats and Democratic issues that could benefit the president politically. Hill also testified that, at one point, Bolton referred to Giuliani as a “hand grenade” that’s “going to blow everybody up.” And so we were able to basically pull together this and some other elements of the story and publish it, I think, about 10:30 at night, and really be able to tell the story of day one behind those closed doors.

michael barbaro

So beyond this being a very juicy scoop, what’s the significance of the testimony that Fiona Hill gave? What does it do for the inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So there are a couple things that I would say. One is that she implicates her boss, John Bolton, who is a boldface name in Washington. He’s the president’s top national security adviser. And saying that high up in the chain, the president’s national security adviser is calling this a “drug deal,” was so concerned about this he had me go to the lawyers — and it kind of opened the door to the fact that this set of events that we’re learning about in retrospect were setting off alarms in real time, and at very high levels of the government. The other aspect of it, though, is that I’m looking ahead to the rest of the week, and it seems pretty clear she’s not going to be the last person. Unlike in past investigations, where the White House has successfully shut down Congress, important witnesses are coming, and they’re going to talk, and they’re going to tell their story. We’re actually going to understand what happened here.

michael barbaro

Nick, I guess I just have, like, a collegial inquiry here. What’s the point of standing around all day if you end up getting the best stuff when you get home at, like, 10 o’clock at night?

nicholas fandos

[LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Doesn’t that suggest that maybe you’re not going about this in the most efficient way?

nicholas fandos

Uhh, it’s a fair point. But we do learn some pretty significant details that set the stage for the rest of the week.

michael barbaro

O.K. So what happens the next day, on Tuesday?

rachel quester Ready for day two. clare toeniskoetter Yeah.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday, we know that there is going to be another one of these closed-door depositions that’s probably going to go on again for hours, this time with a senior State Department official who was more or less in charge of Ukraine policy for the State Department.

speaker 1 So Julie’s group, we’re going to gather up. Make sure we have everybody. I don’t see Brian. speaker 2 I don’t either.

nicholas fandos

But the first thing that I notice as I arrive at the Capitol is that the place has been transformed overnight.

rachel quester O.K., so Nick just walked away, because he got a call from a member of Congress.

nicholas fandos

After two weeks of recess, lawmakers are back.

speaker Madam Speaker, will there be an formal vote on an impeachment inquiry? Madam Speaker?

nicholas fandos

There are even tourists wandering around through the SCIF area, running into reporters.

speaker 1 In part to keep an eye on the British. speaker 2 Yeah, it’s somewhere up there. Oh, wait. There we go.

nicholas fandos

Stopping, looking at the TV reporters, who they recognize from CNN.

speaker 1 Have you guys heard of the whole impeachment inquiry? speaker 2 Mm-hmm. speaker 3 Yeah. That’s craziness.

nicholas fandos

The press corps seems to have somehow doubled. I don’t know how, because it’s already been huge following this stuff. And there’s just kind of an energy gripping the place that comes with 535 or so lawmakers and their staff, their kind of entourages, being back, moving around the Capitol.

michael barbaro

Can any member of Congress walk into the SCIF, right by you, and actually listen to these depositions as testimony?

nicholas fandos

The answer is no. And we actually saw it a couple times this week, when Republicans tried to go in and sit in on these depositions. But they were not on the committees that are leading the investigation. And therefore, under the committee rules, they ended up getting kicked out. But with lawmakers back in town, you’re talking about three committees that are leading the impeachment investigation. That’s dozens and dozens of lawmakers that sit on those. And they can all go and sit in. And they can come out, and they’re not supposed to talk in detail about what transpired, but they can give general impressions and hints about what they heard. In one case, one Democrat came out and basically broke the rules and just talked about what was happening completely.

archived recording How did the questioning go today, Gerry? archived recording (gerry connolly) I thought it was very powerful testimony.

michael barbaro

And what did this Democrat divulge?

nicholas fandos

So he comes out and says —

archived recording (gerry connolly) Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine —

nicholas fandos

— that he’d just heard the witness in the room, a State Department official named George Kent —

archived recording (gerry connolly) — who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine.

nicholas fandos

— that he and other career diplomats who were in charge of the State Department’s policy toward Ukraine had been shoved aside —

archived recording (gerry connolly) All of the people charged with policy in Ukraine were replaced, apparently, after a May 23rd meeting at the White House organized by Mick Mulvaney, not John Bolton or Pompeo.

nicholas fandos

— and were told, starting late in the spring, that basically, their services weren’t needed anymore —

archived recording (gerry connolly) And that was wrong. He used that word, “wrong.”

nicholas fandos

— that policy towards Ukraine was going to be run by Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, and others out of the White House —

archived recording (gerry connolly) The import of this testimony is deeply disturbing, especially the role of Rudy Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

— and they may as well lay low.

michael barbaro

And what’s the significance of that?

nicholas fandos

So the significance of that is that you have here another high-level American diplomat saying that the normal channels for foreign policy that have guided American policy for quite a long time are being stepped on, basically, by the White House, which is putting their own guys in charge. And one of them that he singles out, yet again, is Gordon Sondland. Now you have a second witness, two in two days, coming forward and giving a pretty consistent account. This is all picking up a little bit of momentum.

michael barbaro

So I’m taking it you didn’t watch the Democratic debate.

nicholas fandos

I did not watch the Democratic debate, and I did not watch playoff baseball.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

nicholas fandos

What if we take a 20-minute break, and I can go and satisfy my editors a little bit by updating some stories?

michael barbaro

Yeah. All right. We’ll be back, as we say.

nicholas fandos

O.K. More soon.

clare toeniskoetter Thanks, Nick. nicholas fandos You guys going to hang here? michael barbaro Yeah. rachel quester O.K. Should we go to break there?

michael barbaro

That was the idea.

clare toeniskoetter See ya!

michael barbaro

O.K. So Wednesday.

nicholas fandos

Wednesday. Another day, another diplomat. This time, it’s a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who quit the State Department last week, reportedly because he was so frustrated by the very things that we’re talking about. He tried to raise alarms by that and didn’t get a response. And he was so fed up, he said he quit. So it’s clear after three days of testimony that we’re starting to see the diplomatic and foreign policy core, the expertise, the professional class that handles American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican administrations, basically coming one by one to tell a remarkably consistent story about how, in ways that they were uncomfortable with and they had not seen before, they were getting pushed aside. And the policy that was being executed in their place — they would say it’s not even a policy — but the actions in their place, basically, rather than, to put it in their words, the policy serving the well-being of the Ukrainians and the United States, it was serving the well-being of the president of the United States. And that was about it.

michael barbaro

But how exactly is that the basis of an impeachment inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not the fact that they were pushed aside that they see as so problematic. They’re telling a story about what happened once they were pushed aside. They think that’s created a set of conditions that led to these events that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. And that’s really what investigators are trying to get to the bottom of. And now, they’ve been able to establish how the circumstances, or the scene, was set for those things to happen by these current and former diplomats. But they still have more investigative work to flesh that out. ^CLARE TOENISKOETTER^ O.K., we’re walking up.

speaker All right. So I’m going to just watch for — nicholas fandos If that’s O.K. speaker Yeah, yeah.

nicholas fandos

So in the middle of all this on Wednesday, I meet up with my colleague, Sheryl Stolberg.

nicholas fandos Yeah, we’ll probably go to one of those tables. sheryl gay stolberg You think it’ll be a standing interview? nicholas fandos I hope not. But, you know, a guy’s got to get his steps in.

nicholas fandos

And we’re going to go upstairs into the Capitol to interview Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who chairs the Intelligence Committee and is the man at the center of all these hearings leading the impeachment investigation. We had been hoping to sit down with Schiff in his office and have a kind of quieter, more reflective meeting. But indicative of the way things are in the middle of this inquiry, his staff asked, instead, if we could meet in a reception room.

sheryl gay stolberg Let’s take this corner.

nicholas fandos

Right off the floor of the Capitol, where there were different meet-and-greets going on, and constituents were meeting with their members of Congress. And the room was buzzing and lively. And we staked out a corner where we could talk to Congressman Schiff.

adam schiff How are you doing? nicholas fandos How are you? adam schiff Good. nicholas fandos Here, and Sheryl’s over here too. sheryl gay stolberg Hi! adam schiff Hi, how are you?

nicholas fandos

And we were able to put to him some, kind of, key questions about what we thought was going on to see how he sees it.

sheryl gay stolberg You know, the president talks a lot about the deep state. Does it strike you that this is exactly what he fears, or what he thinks of as the deep state? adam schiff You know, the deep state theory used to be a fringe theory in third-world countries or kooky conspiracy theorists at home. When the president talks about the deep state, what he’s really talking about is, in particular, people that expose his wrongdoing and misconduct.

nicholas fandos

At one point, we put the question to him of what he made of all these diplomats coming forward and telling this story.

adam schiff You know, there’s no revolt, and there’s no deep state. sheryl gay stolberg I’m being —

nicholas fandos

He quibbled a little bit with the wording that Sheryl used. But he basically said, I agree with the premise of the question.

adam schiff I think it’s a very serious attack on career public servants who are unwilling to compromise themselves in the president’s service. This has to be the last question because I’ve got to go vote on the last vote. sheryl gay stolberg I have two more real quickies. Do you have enough evidence to impeach? adam schiff I’ve got to go vote. sheryl gay stolberg Can he come back or is that it? nicholas fandos I can ask.

michael barbaro

So another busy day. Where is your head as Wednesday comes to an end?

nicholas fandos

So by the end of Wednesday, it just feels inescapable that this is all building, at least this week, towards Gordon Sondland coming in himself on Thursday and giving his account of what happened, of facing questions about these various accusations and accounts that investigators have been getting all week. And figuring out, how does he explain this stuff? How does he view what was going on? And we left the Capitol Wednesday evening waiting to see exactly what he was going to say.

michael barbaro

Right. Like, if this is a play, the character that everyone’s been talking about for the last 90 minutes eventually has to come onstage and say something.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Except for, in this case, the stage is behind closed doors. And saying something, it turns out, amounts to releasing an 18-page opening statement Thursday morning right before he begins to answer questions.

nicholas fandos Hello. michael barbaro Hi. nicholas fandos Welcome. michael barbaro Very nice to see you. nicholas fandos Very nice to see you.

michael barbaro

So that’s how Thursday morning begins. I walk into the Capitol with Rachel and Clare just as, it seems, you are digesting Gordon Sondland’s opening statements.

nicholas fandos And my morning was basically spent trying to go through 18 pages of what he was going to go in there and say.

nicholas fandos

We received a copy of his opening statement. And Mike Schmidt, our colleague, and I pored through it to try and figure out, what’s new here? What’s he addressing? What does he have to say? And a couple of things jumped out at us. He basically says, in a meeting that he had with President Trump in May, not long after the new Ukrainian president is elected, President Trump basically rejected Sondland’s advice and the advice of other diplomats that were with him who said, you know, Mr. President, we think you ought to meet with this new guy. We think he’s going to do good work. Trump didn’t seem interested, and then directed them, Sondland said, to go through Rudy Giuliani, to go through his private lawyer.

michael barbaro

On Ukraine foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

He gave Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, and other high-ranking officials in the room the direct impression that he had empowered Rudy Giuliani to basically run American policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

I mean, all week we’d been hearing these career nonpartisan diplomats coming in and pointing at Gordon Sondland. And here you have Gordon Sondland turning around just as quickly and pointing at the president and Rudy Giuliani and saying, everything I did, I did because they told me to. And I didn’t always feel good about it. I don’t think Rudy Giuliani should have been involved. I think the men and women of the State Department ought to be running our foreign policy, he testified. But I have to follow the directions of the president. And I thought, more or less, that I could work within those parameters to still achieve an end that I believed in, to still help Ukraine. And he said something interesting. He says, I didn’t realize at first. It was only later that I realized that Rudy Giuliani may have had some other motivations in mind. As if all of this is not enough, one of the president’s loyal diplomats seeming to turn on him and point the finger back at him.

michael barbaro Hello. michael shear How are you? michael barbaro Mr. Shear. michael shear Good to see you.

nicholas fandos

My colleague Mike Shear walks up.

michael barbaro I’m just going to say, any email that starts with, “This will be interesting,” I want to read the rest of. michael shear Mick Mulvaney is about to give a press briefing. nicholas fandos Oh, jeez.

nicholas fandos

And says, hey, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who never addresses the press, has just scheduled a 12:30 press conference at the White House. He’s going to talk to reporters. And we think he’s going to talk about Ukraine.

michael shear But, I mean, he should get a lot of questions about this stuff, about impeachment. I mean, he’s going to the White House press briefing room.

nicholas fandos

So Mike and I go back to a press room just outside the SCIF and set up shop around his computer, where we tune into this press conference.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

rachel quester (WHISPERING) What’s happening? michael barbaro We’re with Nick Fandos and Mike Shear watching Mulvaney.

nicholas fandos

He starts to field questions. And it gets crazy really fast.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.

nicholas fandos

After this week of slow drip disclosures, and after weeks of the White House denying that there had been any kind of leverage, or quid pro quo, or exchange with the Ukrainians around the suspension of security aid for the country, he comes out and basically says — he does say, on the record, that —

archived recording So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to the Ukraine? archived recording (mick mulvaney) The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. Then that is absolutely appropriate.

nicholas fandos

The White House withheld the aid for several reasons. And one of those reasons was President Trump wanted Ukraine to first commit to investigating potential collusion between Ukrainians and Democrats in the 2016 election that was meant to undermine his campaign. And on top of it, Mulvaney says, yep, this was the deal.

archived recording Let’s be clear. What you’ve just described is a quid pro quo.

nicholas fandos

Reporters quickly call it a quid pro quo.

archived recording It is — funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well. archived recording (mick mulvaney) We do that all the time with foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

And he said, that’s fine. It happens all the time. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) If you read the news reports, and you believe them — what did McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy, that was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody, get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.

michael barbaro

I mean, that’s an extraordinary thing for the White House chief of staff to say.

nicholas fandos

It is. And he goes a little bit further. He’s asked about Rudy Giuliani and his role. And his defense, again, is essentially that the president of the United States gets to dictate foreign policy. And if he wants his personal lawyer — a guy who he’s not paying, a guy who’s doing business, by the way, in Ukraine at the same time he’s evidently doing diplomacy — to run American foreign policy, well, that’s his prerogative. Elections have consequences. And that’s O.K. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Elections do have consequences. And they should. And your foreign policy is going to change. Obama did it in one way, we’re doing it in a different way. And there’s no problem with that.

nicholas fandos

It’s a pretty stunning assertion. A pretty stunning view of executive power. It suggests the White House has not been telling the whole truth up till today.

michael barbaro

And then decided to tell it in a kind of extreme, unexpected way.

nicholas fandos

Right. It’s a little baffling to understand what exactly Mick Mulvaney was doing here.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) I’m not going to take anymore. It’s nice to see everybody. Thanks again. nicholas fandos All right, so we should — we should get on the phone. mike shear What the hell just happened? michael barbaro Why don’t you take some time to figure out what this all means? nicholas fandos There’s also probably about to be a House vote, where we may need to go and see if we can’t get some quick reaction.

nicholas fandos

You know, it was pretty evident in the hour or so after that press conference that lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn’t quite know what to make of it either.

recording^

Today, the chief of staff said what we’ve always just talked about. It was also about exonerating Russia and looking at the 2016 election.

nicholas fandos

Some said, well, they just admitted to the whole thing, I suppose. So what do we do now? Others, Adam Schiff said —

archived recording (adam schiff) It certainly indicates that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.

nicholas fandos

A story that’s very, very bad just got much, much worse.

michael barbaro

Well, to the extent, Nick, that it’s knowable, what do you make of why the White House decided to do this? It’s kind of hard to understand.

nicholas fandos

It is. We don’t know if Mulvaney was acting on his own authority, who had put him out there. The president’s legal team, one of his other lawyers who’s not Rudy Giuliani, said he hadn’t been consulted before Mulvaney went out there. You know, there has been a move that President Trump returns to time and again in his presidency. And part of me wonders if this isn’t the same thing, where, when he’s being accused of something bad, of having done something under the table or that would be deemed inappropriate for others, instead of pretending he didn’t, he just kind of throws it all out into the open and says, you know, yeah, I did this. But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. So what? Tell me it’s wrong. And I think at the end of this week, one of the biggest questions that I think emerges from all this stuff is that it’s now up to Congress, not just Democrats, but Republicans, too, to answer that question and say, is this right, or is this wrong? If he’s going to own up to most of it, and assuming that more officials come forward and fill in different pieces of this story as we’re coming to understand it, you know, can they stomach that? And is that a transgression that they’re willing to say is worthy of impeachment and worthy of his removal from office? I mean, it’s kind of on the president’s part, potentially, the ultimate high-stakes bluff, and I don’t think we know yet where things are going to fall out.

[music]

nicholas fandos

I think what we’re left with at the end of this week is, like, a question. Is this a story of a bunch of career diplomats, who have never really much liked President Trump or his policies, rebelling against him? And I don’t think that they really see it that way. From their perspective, you know, they’re used to having policy differences with presidents of both parties. They’re trained to implement the policies of Republicans and of Democrats. What I think is different, what is leading otherwise anonymous officials to blow the whistle, to march up to Capitol Hill and walk down all those flights of steps to the House SCIF and tell the story as they see it, is that they see this as something fundamentally different, and, importantly, as a part of their responsibility as permanent agents of the government, of people who are working on behalf of the American people, not a particular president, and that only when things seem to get so bad did they decide they needed to speak up.

michael barbaro

Nick, thank you for essentially giving us your entire week. We appreciate it.

nicholas fandos

It was a pleasure to have the company.

michael barbaro

It can get lonely in front of a SCIF, I imagine. Anyway, thank you, truly.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, I’m glad you guys were here. It’s been quite a story.

michael barbaro

The rest — so on Thursday night, there was a huge bipartisan outcry, and the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, tries to walk back his comments about a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He issues a statement essentially denying what he has said just a few hours earlier. And I’m going to read you the quote. He said, “Let me be clear. There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.” We’ll be right back.

sheryl gay stolberg How does it sound? michael barbaro It sounds pretty good. sheryl gay stolberg Sound O.K.? michael barbaro I’ve never actually produced a bit of — any audio on my own. So this is a bit of an experiment. sheryl gay stolberg O.K., great. michael barbaro And I think this is definitely the first time we have done the headlines of “The Daily” inside the Senate press gallery. So Sheryl Stolberg — oh, I think, I’m supposed to hold this to my own mouth.

michael barbaro

So Sheryl, what do we need to know today?

sheryl gay stolberg

So it was a really busy news day.

archived recording (mike pence) Today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdogan in Turkey and the United States of America that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.

sheryl gay stolberg

Vice President Pence flew to Turkey, and on Thursday afternoon, he announced that Turkey had agreed to a cease-fire in which the Turkish government would suspend its military operations in northern Syria for five days in order to give the Kurds time to clear the area. So that raises the question, is this a breakthrough, or is this just giving Turkey what it wants in the first place, because they wanted the Kurds out?

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording Will you support this deal? What do you think of it? archived recording (jeremy corbyn) Well, from what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or our expectations.

sheryl gay stolberg

There’s finally a deal for Brexit that the European Union and Britain both think will work. But it’s not clear if it’s going to pass, because it has to go through Parliament, and the Labour Party has already said it’s opposed.

archived recording (jeremy corbyn) We are unhappy with this deal, and as it stands, we’ll vote against it.

sheryl gay stolberg

And finally, on Thursday, it was a sad day here in the Capitol, because Representative Elijah Cummings, a towering figure in the House, died. Cummings was a son of sharecroppers. His own presence here was really a miracle to him.

archived recording (elijah cummings) My father had never been in the Capitol building. He said, isn’t this the place where they used to call us slaves? I said, yes sir. And isn’t this the place they used to call us three-fifths of a man? I said, yes, sir. And isn’t this the place that they used to call us chattel? I say, yes, yes, yes, sir. And I’ll never forget, he said, when I think about you being sworn in today, he said, now I see what I could have been if I had had an opportunity.

sheryl gay stolberg

And over the last year, as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he had been a central figure in the investigations of the president, and in his role in these investigations, he continually pleaded for decency.

archived recording (elijah cummings) We are better than this. We are so much — we really are. As a country, we are so much better than this. And I’m hoping that all of us can get back to this democracy that we want and that we should be passing on to our children so that they can do better than what we did.

michael barbaro

Sheryl, thank you.

sheryl gay stolberg

Thank you, Michael.

clare toeniskoetter We’re walking out?

Oh, we’re waiting for Nick to get off the phone. clare toeniskoetter We also could say hi. michael barbaro I have a croissant I’d like to finish.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

speaker Are you going to bring him in for a deposition?

michael barbaro

Today —

speaker 1 Nothing further at this moment. speaker 2 Does this move the ball for impeachment, in your mind?

michael barbaro

A week inside the U.S. Capitol as the impeachment inquiry enters a pivotal phase. It’s Friday, October 18.

nicholas fandos There’s a bunch of rooms, so — michael barbaro O.K. clare toeniskoetter What’s going on? michael barbaro We’re just trying to find a room that is quiet enough to make an episode of “The Daily.” nicholas fandos I think this will work.

michael barbaro

O.K. Here we go. Nick Fandos, you’ve been on the Hill all week. Walk me through this. What does the impeachment inquiry actually look like on the ground?

nicholas fandos

Yeah. So, I mean, the crazy thing is that the house opened this impeachment inquiry a little more than three weeks ago now on their way out of town for a two-week recess. So members were scattered all over the country, meeting with constituents, holding town halls, while back here in the Capitol, a core group of staff members, basically, for the House Intelligence Committee and a couple of others, stuck around and began issuing subpoenas and requests, setting up the very first witness depositions for their investigation. And so this week was the week that five of those depositions, one a day, were lined up, and lawmakers were going to be coming back. So that’s kind of what I was expecting when I arrived at the Capitol on Monday.

rachel quester Hello. nicholas fandos Hey, it’s Nick. rachel quester Hi, how’s it going?

nicholas fandos

And I met up with our colleagues from “The Daily,” Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter, who were going to spend the week with me.

nicholas fandos It’s so nice outside. rachel quester It’s so nice outside.

nicholas fandos

We had to meet up outside of the Capitol because it was Columbus Day, actually. The press galleries and all the functional staff were not working here. So I had to escort them in specially. We walked inside and down three sets of stairs.

clare toeniskoetter Where are we? nicholas fandos We’re standing now beside the doors to the House Intelligence Committee SCIF.

nicholas fandos

And at the bottom of those stairs, we end up at the secured rooms, we call it the SCIF, of the House Intelligence Committee —

clare toeniskoetter Wait, SCIF? Secure — nicholas fandos Compartmentalized Information Facility.

nicholas fandos

— which is one of the most secretive in Congress. It’s where this investigation is taking place, all behind closed doors.

nicholas fandos And they have these red stickers on them, which get photographed all the time and are always in the newspaper, which just say “restricted area.” You can’t go there.

nicholas fandos

So the three of us and a bunch of reporters were gathered around outside, basically waiting for any emissaries to come out of the room and give some sense of what was going on back there with the very first witness deposition.

nicholas fandos We spend all day trying to mentally pierce that barrier.

michael barbaro

So it says something about this week that this room is where Congress is holding these hearings.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, that’s right. I mean, it’s entirely outside of the public view. This is an investigation that could result in an attempt to remove President Trump. And the earliest stages of the investigation, at least, are all being conducted out of public view. And this has been a source of some contention early on.

archived recording (jim jordan) The first two interviews, totalling approximately 20 hours, not one single thing was said in those respective interviews that the American people should not be able to see, should not be able to hear.

nicholas fandos

Republicans have really seized on it to accuse Democrats of, basically, trying to impeach Trump in private —

archived recording (jim jordan) The tragedy here, and the crime here, is that the American people don’t get to see what’s going on in these sessions.

nicholas fandos

— of hiding important work from the American people and from the press, who might be able to evaluate it. And the Democrats argue, though, that basically, this is investigative best practice. That, unlike past impeachments, they don’t already know what the story is. They need to find out the details. And the best way to investigate it is in private, where witnesses can’t line up their stories by hearing what somebody else testified, where lawyers can ask most of the questions, rather than lawmakers who are, maybe, trying to fundraise off of some quip, or speak to their constituents at a public hearing. And this allows them, ideally, to move quickly and collect a lot of information efficiently. And then, they figure out, what have we found? And what is the best of what we’ve got? And they move that, then, into the public sphere. And they present that evidence, they invite their best witnesses to come and testify, and they can kind of control the story that they’re building against the president.

michael barbaro

Much like a prosecutor, or a district attorney, quietly builds a case, makes an announcement of whether or not there’s an indictment, and then goes to trial.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. The rub, of course, is that this is Congress. And politicians love to blab. They get information that looks damaging to the president. If you’re a Democrat, you’d love for that to get out.

michael barbaro

So what’s the situation on Monday when it comes to these hearings? What’s actually happening in that SCIF, behind those closed doors?

nicholas fandos

So for most of the day Monday, all I know is that this former White House official, Fiona Hill, is in there testifying. And it’s hour after hour after hour. There’s very little information coming out. My feet are getting sore.

nicholas fandos Hey. Are you still free?

nicholas fandos

Chit-chatting with other reporters. Basically waiting for any kind of emissary to come out of the room and give us a sense of what’s going on.

nicholas fandos It seems pretty quiet. I think Schiff just left to go — he’s speaking at the 92nd Street Y.

michael barbaro

You’re just spending the day standing outside this room.

nicholas fandos

Right.

nicholas fandos [SIGHS] clare toeniskoetter How many hours do you think you’ve spent standing, waiting, doing nothing so far? nicholas fandos I don’t know. Probably north of 30 hours, 35 hours. But it’ll get worse.

nicholas fandos

And it was a long day. And, eventually, the sun goes down. Fiona Hill is still not done. And she finally leaves at about 8 o’clock.

clare toeniskoetter Bye, thank you!

nicholas fandos

I just kind of had to go home. Because there was not a whole lot more reporting to do here.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

nicholas fandos

And it was only as I was walking back up to my apartment building that I started hearing from some sources and being able to piece together, over the next couple of hours, what had actually happened that day. And the testimony, it turns out, was pretty remarkable.

michael barbaro

What was the testimony?

nicholas fandos

So you’ve got to keep in mind, Fiona Hill is a respected career Russia expert who was brought in to the Trump administration to work for John Bolton on the National Security Council as one of the president’s top advisers on Europe and Russia policy. So she’s right at the center of traditional decision making around policy towards Ukraine. And the account that she gives is that there was a meeting earlier this summer in July where several other diplomats, including Gordon Sondland, a former Trump donor who had become ambassador to the European Union, met with some Ukrainian officials. And she tells lawmakers that this meeting veered dangerously off course, from her perspective, and that she and her boss, John Bolton, were so alarmed by what was said that Bolton told her, you need to go to White House lawyers right now and tell them that we’re not part of, and this was a quote, “whatever drug deal” these guys are cooking up.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

Not a literal drug deal. But what Bolton and Hill thought was going on is that Sondland and the president’s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were basically holding out from the Ukrainians a White House meeting with President Trump, which is what they wanted, as leverage for the Ukrainians agreeing to investigate Democrats and Democratic issues that could benefit the president politically. Hill also testified that, at one point, Bolton referred to Giuliani as a “hand grenade” that’s “going to blow everybody up.” And so we were able to basically pull together this and some other elements of the story and publish it, I think, about 10:30 at night, and really be able to tell the story of day one behind those closed doors.

michael barbaro

So beyond this being a very juicy scoop, what’s the significance of the testimony that Fiona Hill gave? What does it do for the inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So there are a couple things that I would say. One is that she implicates her boss, John Bolton, who is a boldface name in Washington. He’s the president’s top national security adviser. And saying that high up in the chain, the president’s national security adviser is calling this a “drug deal,” was so concerned about this he had me go to the lawyers — and it kind of opened the door to the fact that this set of events that we’re learning about in retrospect were setting off alarms in real time, and at very high levels of the government. The other aspect of it, though, is that I’m looking ahead to the rest of the week, and it seems pretty clear she’s not going to be the last person. Unlike in past investigations, where the White House has successfully shut down Congress, important witnesses are coming, and they’re going to talk, and they’re going to tell their story. We’re actually going to understand what happened here.

michael barbaro

Nick, I guess I just have, like, a collegial inquiry here. What’s the point of standing around all day if you end up getting the best stuff when you get home at, like, 10 o’clock at night?

nicholas fandos

[LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Doesn’t that suggest that maybe you’re not going about this in the most efficient way?

nicholas fandos

Uhh, it’s a fair point. But we do learn some pretty significant details that set the stage for the rest of the week.

michael barbaro

O.K. So what happens the next day, on Tuesday?

rachel quester Ready for day two. clare toeniskoetter Yeah.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday, we know that there is going to be another one of these closed-door depositions that’s probably going to go on again for hours, this time with a senior State Department official who was more or less in charge of Ukraine policy for the State Department.

speaker 1 So Julie’s group, we’re going to gather up. Make sure we have everybody. I don’t see Brian. speaker 2 I don’t either.

nicholas fandos

But the first thing that I notice as I arrive at the Capitol is that the place has been transformed overnight.

rachel quester O.K., so Nick just walked away, because he got a call from a member of Congress.

nicholas fandos

After two weeks of recess, lawmakers are back.

speaker Madam Speaker, will there be an formal vote on an impeachment inquiry? Madam Speaker?

nicholas fandos

There are even tourists wandering around through the SCIF area, running into reporters.

speaker 1 In part to keep an eye on the British. speaker 2 Yeah, it’s somewhere up there. Oh, wait. There we go.

nicholas fandos

Stopping, looking at the TV reporters, who they recognize from CNN.

speaker 1 Have you guys heard of the whole impeachment inquiry? speaker 2 Mm-hmm. speaker 3 Yeah. That’s craziness.

nicholas fandos

The press corps seems to have somehow doubled. I don’t know how, because it’s already been huge following this stuff. And there’s just kind of an energy gripping the place that comes with 535 or so lawmakers and their staff, their kind of entourages, being back, moving around the Capitol.

michael barbaro

Can any member of Congress walk into the SCIF, right by you, and actually listen to these depositions as testimony?

nicholas fandos

The answer is no. And we actually saw it a couple times this week, when Republicans tried to go in and sit in on these depositions. But they were not on the committees that are leading the investigation. And therefore, under the committee rules, they ended up getting kicked out. But with lawmakers back in town, you’re talking about three committees that are leading the impeachment investigation. That’s dozens and dozens of lawmakers that sit on those. And they can all go and sit in. And they can come out, and they’re not supposed to talk in detail about what transpired, but they can give general impressions and hints about what they heard. In one case, one Democrat came out and basically broke the rules and just talked about what was happening completely.

archived recording How did the questioning go today, Gerry? archived recording (gerry connolly) I thought it was very powerful testimony.

michael barbaro

And what did this Democrat divulge?

nicholas fandos

So he comes out and says —

archived recording (gerry connolly) Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine —

nicholas fandos

— that he’d just heard the witness in the room, a State Department official named George Kent —

archived recording (gerry connolly) — who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine.

nicholas fandos

— that he and other career diplomats who were in charge of the State Department’s policy toward Ukraine had been shoved aside —

archived recording (gerry connolly) All of the people charged with policy in Ukraine were replaced, apparently, after a May 23rd meeting at the White House organized by Mick Mulvaney, not John Bolton or Pompeo.

nicholas fandos

— and were told, starting late in the spring, that basically, their services weren’t needed anymore —

archived recording (gerry connolly) And that was wrong. He used that word, “wrong.”

nicholas fandos

— that policy towards Ukraine was going to be run by Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, and others out of the White House —

archived recording (gerry connolly) The import of this testimony is deeply disturbing, especially the role of Rudy Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

— and they may as well lay low.

michael barbaro

And what’s the significance of that?

nicholas fandos

So the significance of that is that you have here another high-level American diplomat saying that the normal channels for foreign policy that have guided American policy for quite a long time are being stepped on, basically, by the White House, which is putting their own guys in charge. And one of them that he singles out, yet again, is Gordon Sondland. Now you have a second witness, two in two days, coming forward and giving a pretty consistent account. This is all picking up a little bit of momentum.

michael barbaro

So I’m taking it you didn’t watch the Democratic debate.

nicholas fandos

I did not watch the Democratic debate, and I did not watch playoff baseball.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

nicholas fandos

What if we take a 20-minute break, and I can go and satisfy my editors a little bit by updating some stories?

michael barbaro

Yeah. All right. We’ll be back, as we say.

nicholas fandos

O.K. More soon.

clare toeniskoetter Thanks, Nick. nicholas fandos You guys going to hang here? michael barbaro Yeah. rachel quester O.K. Should we go to break there?

michael barbaro

That was the idea.

clare toeniskoetter See ya!

michael barbaro

O.K. So Wednesday.

nicholas fandos

Wednesday. Another day, another diplomat. This time, it’s a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who quit the State Department last week, reportedly because he was so frustrated by the very things that we’re talking about. He tried to raise alarms by that and didn’t get a response. And he was so fed up, he said he quit. So it’s clear after three days of testimony that we’re starting to see the diplomatic and foreign policy core, the expertise, the professional class that handles American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican administrations, basically coming one by one to tell a remarkably consistent story about how, in ways that they were uncomfortable with and they had not seen before, they were getting pushed aside. And the policy that was being executed in their place — they would say it’s not even a policy — but the actions in their place, basically, rather than, to put it in their words, the policy serving the well-being of the Ukrainians and the United States, it was serving the well-being of the president of the United States. And that was about it.

michael barbaro

But how exactly is that the basis of an impeachment inquiry?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not the fact that they were pushed aside that they see as so problematic. They’re telling a story about what happened once they were pushed aside. They think that’s created a set of conditions that led to these events that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. And that’s really what investigators are trying to get to the bottom of. And now, they’ve been able to establish how the circumstances, or the scene, was set for those things to happen by these current and former diplomats. But they still have more investigative work to flesh that out. ^CLARE TOENISKOETTER^ O.K., we’re walking up.

speaker All right. So I’m going to just watch for — nicholas fandos If that’s O.K. speaker Yeah, yeah.

nicholas fandos

So in the middle of all this on Wednesday, I meet up with my colleague, Sheryl Stolberg.

nicholas fandos Yeah, we’ll probably go to one of those tables. sheryl gay stolberg You think it’ll be a standing interview? nicholas fandos I hope not. But, you know, a guy’s got to get his steps in.

nicholas fandos

And we’re going to go upstairs into the Capitol to interview Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who chairs the Intelligence Committee and is the man at the center of all these hearings leading the impeachment investigation. We had been hoping to sit down with Schiff in his office and have a kind of quieter, more reflective meeting. But indicative of the way things are in the middle of this inquiry, his staff asked, instead, if we could meet in a reception room.

sheryl gay stolberg Let’s take this corner.

nicholas fandos

Right off the floor of the Capitol, where there were different meet-and-greets going on, and constituents were meeting with their members of Congress. And the room was buzzing and lively. And we staked out a corner where we could talk to Congressman Schiff.

adam schiff How are you doing? nicholas fandos How are you? adam schiff Good. nicholas fandos Here, and Sheryl’s over here too. sheryl gay stolberg Hi! adam schiff Hi, how are you?

nicholas fandos

And we were able to put to him some, kind of, key questions about what we thought was going on to see how he sees it.

sheryl gay stolberg You know, the president talks a lot about the deep state. Does it strike you that this is exactly what he fears, or what he thinks of as the deep state? adam schiff You know, the deep state theory used to be a fringe theory in third-world countries or kooky conspiracy theorists at home. When the president talks about the deep state, what he’s really talking about is, in particular, people that expose his wrongdoing and misconduct.

nicholas fandos

At one point, we put the question to him of what he made of all these diplomats coming forward and telling this story.

adam schiff You know, there’s no revolt, and there’s no deep state. sheryl gay stolberg I’m being —

nicholas fandos

He quibbled a little bit with the wording that Sheryl used. But he basically said, I agree with the premise of the question.

adam schiff I think it’s a very serious attack on career public servants who are unwilling to compromise themselves in the president’s service. This has to be the last question because I’ve got to go vote on the last vote. sheryl gay stolberg I have two more real quickies. Do you have enough evidence to impeach? adam schiff I’ve got to go vote. sheryl gay stolberg Can he come back or is that it? nicholas fandos I can ask.

michael barbaro

So another busy day. Where is your head as Wednesday comes to an end?

nicholas fandos

So by the end of Wednesday, it just feels inescapable that this is all building, at least this week, towards Gordon Sondland coming in himself on Thursday and giving his account of what happened, of facing questions about these various accusations and accounts that investigators have been getting all week. And figuring out, how does he explain this stuff? How does he view what was going on? And we left the Capitol Wednesday evening waiting to see exactly what he was going to say.

michael barbaro

Right. Like, if this is a play, the character that everyone’s been talking about for the last 90 minutes eventually has to come onstage and say something.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Except for, in this case, the stage is behind closed doors. And saying something, it turns out, amounts to releasing an 18-page opening statement Thursday morning right before he begins to answer questions.

nicholas fandos Hello. michael barbaro Hi. nicholas fandos Welcome. michael barbaro Very nice to see you. nicholas fandos Very nice to see you.

michael barbaro

So that’s how Thursday morning begins. I walk into the Capitol with Rachel and Clare just as, it seems, you are digesting Gordon Sondland’s opening statements.

nicholas fandos And my morning was basically spent trying to go through 18 pages of what he was going to go in there and say.

nicholas fandos

We received a copy of his opening statement. And Mike Schmidt, our colleague, and I pored through it to try and figure out, what’s new here? What’s he addressing? What does he have to say? And a couple of things jumped out at us. He basically says, in a meeting that he had with President Trump in May, not long after the new Ukrainian president is elected, President Trump basically rejected Sondland’s advice and the advice of other diplomats that were with him who said, you know, Mr. President, we think you ought to meet with this new guy. We think he’s going to do good work. Trump didn’t seem interested, and then directed them, Sondland said, to go through Rudy Giuliani, to go through his private lawyer.

michael barbaro

On Ukraine foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

He gave Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, and other high-ranking officials in the room the direct impression that he had empowered Rudy Giuliani to basically run American policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

I mean, all week we’d been hearing these career nonpartisan diplomats coming in and pointing at Gordon Sondland. And here you have Gordon Sondland turning around just as quickly and pointing at the president and Rudy Giuliani and saying, everything I did, I did because they told me to. And I didn’t always feel good about it. I don’t think Rudy Giuliani should have been involved. I think the men and women of the State Department ought to be running our foreign policy, he testified. But I have to follow the directions of the president. And I thought, more or less, that I could work within those parameters to still achieve an end that I believed in, to still help Ukraine. And he said something interesting. He says, I didn’t realize at first. It was only later that I realized that Rudy Giuliani may have had some other motivations in mind. As if all of this is not enough, one of the president’s loyal diplomats seeming to turn on him and point the finger back at him.

michael barbaro Hello. michael shear How are you? michael barbaro Mr. Shear. michael shear Good to see you.

nicholas fandos

My colleague Mike Shear walks up.

michael barbaro I’m just going to say, any email that starts with, “This will be interesting,” I want to read the rest of. michael shear Mick Mulvaney is about to give a press briefing. nicholas fandos Oh, jeez.

nicholas fandos

And says, hey, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who never addresses the press, has just scheduled a 12:30 press conference at the White House. He’s going to talk to reporters. And we think he’s going to talk about Ukraine.

michael shear But, I mean, he should get a lot of questions about this stuff, about impeachment. I mean, he’s going to the White House press briefing room.

nicholas fandos

So Mike and I go back to a press room just outside the SCIF and set up shop around his computer, where we tune into this press conference.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

rachel quester (WHISPERING) What’s happening? michael barbaro We’re with Nick Fandos and Mike Shear watching Mulvaney.

nicholas fandos

He starts to field questions. And it gets crazy really fast.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.

nicholas fandos

After this week of slow drip disclosures, and after weeks of the White House denying that there had been any kind of leverage, or quid pro quo, or exchange with the Ukrainians around the suspension of security aid for the country, he comes out and basically says — he does say, on the record, that —

archived recording So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to the Ukraine? archived recording (mick mulvaney) The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. Then that is absolutely appropriate.

nicholas fandos

The White House withheld the aid for several reasons. And one of those reasons was President Trump wanted Ukraine to first commit to investigating potential collusion between Ukrainians and Democrats in the 2016 election that was meant to undermine his campaign. And on top of it, Mulvaney says, yep, this was the deal.

archived recording Let’s be clear. What you’ve just described is a quid pro quo.

nicholas fandos

Reporters quickly call it a quid pro quo.

archived recording It is — funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well. archived recording (mick mulvaney) We do that all the time with foreign policy.

nicholas fandos

And he said, that’s fine. It happens all the time. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) If you read the news reports, and you believe them — what did McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy, that was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody, get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.

michael barbaro

I mean, that’s an extraordinary thing for the White House chief of staff to say.

nicholas fandos

It is. And he goes a little bit further. He’s asked about Rudy Giuliani and his role. And his defense, again, is essentially that the president of the United States gets to dictate foreign policy. And if he wants his personal lawyer — a guy who he’s not paying, a guy who’s doing business, by the way, in Ukraine at the same time he’s evidently doing diplomacy — to run American foreign policy, well, that’s his prerogative. Elections have consequences. And that’s O.K. There’s nothing wrong with it.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) Elections do have consequences. And they should. And your foreign policy is going to change. Obama did it in one way, we’re doing it in a different way. And there’s no problem with that.

nicholas fandos

It’s a pretty stunning assertion. A pretty stunning view of executive power. It suggests the White House has not been telling the whole truth up till today.

michael barbaro

And then decided to tell it in a kind of extreme, unexpected way.

nicholas fandos

Right. It’s a little baffling to understand what exactly Mick Mulvaney was doing here.

archived recording (mick mulvaney) I’m not going to take anymore. It’s nice to see everybody. Thanks again. nicholas fandos All right, so we should — we should get on the phone. mike shear What the hell just happened? michael barbaro Why don’t you take some time to figure out what this all means? nicholas fandos There’s also probably about to be a House vote, where we may need to go and see if we can’t get some quick reaction.

nicholas fandos

You know, it was pretty evident in the hour or so after that press conference that lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn’t quite know what to make of it either.

recording^

Today, the chief of staff said what we’ve always just talked about. It was also about exonerating Russia and looking at the 2016 election.

nicholas fandos

Some said, well, they just admitted to the whole thing, I suppose. So what do we do now? Others, Adam Schiff said —

archived recording (adam schiff) It certainly indicates that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.

nicholas fandos

A story that’s very, very bad just got much, much worse.

michael barbaro

Well, to the extent, Nick, that it’s knowable, what do you make of why the White House decided to do this? It’s kind of hard to understand.

nicholas fandos

It is. We don’t know if Mulvaney was acting on his own authority, who had put him out there. The president’s legal team, one of his other lawyers who’s not Rudy Giuliani, said he hadn’t been consulted before Mulvaney went out there. You know, there has been a move that President Trump returns to time and again in his presidency. And part of me wonders if this isn’t the same thing, where, when he’s being accused of something bad, of having done something under the table or that would be deemed inappropriate for others, instead of pretending he didn’t, he just kind of throws it all out into the open and says, you know, yeah, I did this. But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. So what? Tell me it’s wrong. And I think at the end of this week, one of the biggest questions that I think emerges from all this stuff is that it’s now up to Congress, not just Democrats, but Republicans, too, to answer that question and say, is this right, or is this wrong? If he’s going to own up to most of it, and assuming that more officials come forward and fill in different pieces of this story as we’re coming to understand it, you know, can they stomach that? And is that a transgression that they’re willing to say is worthy of impeachment and worthy of his removal from office? I mean, it’s kind of on the president’s part, potentially, the ultimate high-stakes bluff, and I don’t think we know yet where things are going to fall out.

[music]

nicholas fandos

I think what we’re left with at the end of this week is, like, a question. Is this a story of a bunch of career diplomats, who have never really much liked President Trump or his policies, rebelling against him? And I don’t think that they really see it that way. From their perspective, you know, they’re used to having policy differences with presidents of both parties. They’re trained to implement the policies of Republicans and of Democrats. What I think is different, what is leading otherwise anonymous officials to blow the whistle, to march up to Capitol Hill and walk down all those flights of steps to the House SCIF and tell the story as they see it, is that they see this as something fundamentally different, and, importantly, as a part of their responsibility as permanent agents of the government, of people who are working on behalf of the American people, not a particular president, and that only when things seem to get so bad did they decide they needed to speak up.

michael barbaro

Nick, thank you for essentially giving us your entire week. We appreciate it.

nicholas fandos

It was a pleasure to have the company.

michael barbaro

It can get lonely in front of a SCIF, I imagine. Anyway, thank you, truly.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, I’m glad you guys were here. It’s been quite a story.

michael barbaro

The rest — so on Thursday night, there was a huge bipartisan outcry, and the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, tries to walk back his comments about a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He issues a statement essentially denying what he has said just a few hours earlier. And I’m going to read you the quote. He said, “Let me be clear. There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.” We’ll be right back.

sheryl gay stolberg How does it sound? michael barbaro It sounds pretty good. sheryl gay stolberg Sound O.K.? michael barbaro I’ve never actually produced a bit of — any audio on my own. So this is a bit of an experiment. sheryl gay stolberg O.K., great. michael barbaro And I think this is definitely the first time we have done the headlines of “The Daily” inside the Senate press gallery. So Sheryl Stolberg — oh, I think, I’m supposed to hold this to my own mouth.

michael barbaro

So Sheryl, what do we need to know today?

sheryl gay stolberg

So it was a really busy news day.

archived recording (mike pence) Today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdogan in Turkey and the United States of America that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.

sheryl gay stolberg

Vice President Pence flew to Turkey, and on Thursday afternoon, he announced that Turkey had agreed to a cease-fire in which the Turkish government would suspend its military operations in northern Syria for five days in order to give the Kurds time to clear the area. So that raises the question, is this a breakthrough, or is this just giving Turkey what it wants in the first place, because they wanted the Kurds out?

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording Will you support this deal? What do you think of it? archived recording (jeremy corbyn) Well, from what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or our expectations.

sheryl gay stolberg

There’s finally a deal for Brexit that the European Union and Britain both think will work. But it’s not clear if it’s going to pass, because it has to go through Parliament, and the Labour Party has already said it’s opposed.

archived recording (jeremy corbyn) We are unhappy with this deal, and as it stands, we’ll vote against it.

sheryl gay stolberg

And finally, on Thursday, it was a sad day here in the Capitol, because Representative Elijah Cummings, a towering figure in the House, died. Cummings was a son of sharecroppers. His own presence here was really a miracle to him.

archived recording (elijah cummings) My father had never been in the Capitol building. He said, isn’t this the place where they used to call us slaves? I said, yes sir. And isn’t this the place they used to call us three-fifths of a man? I said, yes, sir. And isn’t this the place that they used to call us chattel? I say, yes, yes, yes, sir. And I’ll never forget, he said, when I think about you being sworn in today, he said, now I see what I could have been if I had had an opportunity.

sheryl gay stolberg

And over the last year, as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he had been a central figure in the investigations of the president, and in his role in these investigations, he continually pleaded for decency.

archived recording (elijah cummings) We are better than this. We are so much — we really are. As a country, we are so much better than this. And I’m hoping that all of us can get back to this democracy that we want and that we should be passing on to our children so that they can do better than what we did.

michael barbaro

Sheryl, thank you.

sheryl gay stolberg

Thank you, Michael.

Speaking at a campaign rally hours after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered a cease-fire, Mr. Trump defended his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, effectively clearing the way for a brutal Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters who had fought for years alongside the United States against the Islamic State.

The president’s decision to pull out drew rebukes from both Democrats and Republicans, who accused him of abandoning America’s friends. But Mr. Trump said the violence of the past week was useful. “It was unconventional what I did,” he acknowledged. “Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids,” he added. “Then you pull them apart.”

While he has previously denied giving Turkey the green light to attack the Kurds, Mr. Trump implied on Thursday night that actually he had done so in order to persuade the two sides to come to terms. “Without a little tough love, they would never have made this deal,” he said."

The “cease-fire” is merely Turkey giving the Kurds five days to comply before re-engaging in war. Our honor and reputation are now buried under the rot of President Trump’s perfidy.

Re “E.U. Envoy Testifies That Trump Delegated Policy to Giuliani” (news article, Oct. 18):

Really?

Is Mr. Sondland lying, or is he just so incompetent that he doesn’t know basic information about a country in which he’s involved — though I don’t know why the ambassador to the European Union would be involved in Ukraine, which isn’t even an E.U. member."

On May 9, The New York Times ran an article headlined, “Rudy Giuliani Plans Ukraine Trip to Push for Inquiries That Could Help Trump,” which described his search for dirt on the Bidens. (“There’s nothing illegal about it,” Giuliani told The Time s. “Somebody could say it’s improper.”) The next day a CNN piece was headlined, “Giuliani Defends Going to Ukraine to Press for Investigations Connected to Biden.” As the controversy grew, Giuliani canceled the trip.

So while it may be a mistake to overestimate the acuity of Trump appointees, it’s probably safe to say that Sondland knew exactly what he was involved with.

He tried to play the naïf elsewhere in his testimony as well. Toward the end of his statement, he condemned the idea of a president leveraging military aid to get a foreign government to help him politically. “Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong,” he said. “I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.”

The record suggests he did. In July, the former national security adviser John Bolton reportedly told his aide Fiona Hill, “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.” And as Sondland testified behind closed doors, Mick Mulvaney, the White House acting chief of staff, appeared at a manic, combative news conference and made it clear what said drug deal involved.

One reason military aid to Ukraine was temporarily frozen, Mulvaney said, was that Trump wanted the country to investigate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 election. “The look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,” Mulvaney said. He added, sneering: “Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.”

It’s a common Trumpist strategy to brazenly admit crimes in public, disorienting people through sheer shamelessness. It’s also common for Trumpists to do what Mulvaney did a few hours later, when he issued a statement denying that he’d said what we all heard him say. (“Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,” Mulvaney wrote.)

But Sondland’s not really a Trumpist. Based on news reports, he mostly just seems like an insecure opportunist. According to The Post, Sondland had envied some of his rich friends who’d been given ambassadorships in the past, and coveted one of his own. I can understand the longing for honor and status. What confounds me is how anyone could think that working for Trump might provide these things, and not see that any title achieved in this crime-syndicate administration will always come with an asterisk after it, or worse."

How many trillion???

Mr. Biden, deploying one of his favorite rhetorical weapons against Medicare for All, said Tuesday night that the plan would cost $30 trillion, or roughly 278 Jeff Bezoses, over the next 10 years. But Mr. Sanders has pointed out that that figure is much less than what the current system is projected to cost.

The truth is that no one knows for certain whether the country’s health care costs — which in total and per person far exceed those of any other industrialized country — would go up or down under Medicare for All. Ezekiel J. Emanuel and Victor R. Fuchs explain in The Times:

Medicare for All would move money from one column (private health insurance spending) to another (federal health spending); it does not automatically increase total costs. … We have our doubts about Medicare for All. But unaffordability is not a reason to oppose it.

“In some estimates, the country would not pay more for health care,” a Times analysis of five studies found. Rather, there would be “a drastic shift in who is doing the paying.” For that reason, it is more accurate to think of Mr. Sanders’s plan not as an outlay of (imaginary) money but as a redistribution of it away from insurers, drug companies, health care providers and higher-income people.

About those taxes …

Ms. Warren has drawn criticism for her continued unwillingness during debates to say whether Medicare for All would cause taxes to go up for middle-class families. Mr. Sanders admits they would, but Ms. Warren has refused the premise of the question, emphasizing the money most taxpayers would save overall after premiums (which come out of many people’s paychecks like taxes), deductibles, co-pays and coverage gaps are eliminated.

Middle-class people would “save a lot of money on health care,” the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt told NPR in July. Yet how exactly their net costs would change depends on the particulars of Medicare for All’s funding plans, which neither Mr. Sanders nor Ms. Warren has fully outlined. The Times wrote in a fact check:

Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all.

Why not a public option?

Americans should be allowed to keep their private health insurance, Mr. Buttigieg has argued.

“The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs is that it doesn’t trust the American people,” Mr. Buttigieg said during September’s debate. “I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway.” He elaborated on his own health care plan, which he calls “Medicare for all who want it,” in an earlier debate:

You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.

Critics of public option proposals point out that the path may not actually be so glide-y. That’s because the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs, Benjamin Studebaker and Nathan J. Robinson argue in the left-wing magazine Current Affairs, because it gives the government a monopoly on access to patients. “If instead there are a large number of insurance companies, providers can play those insurance companies off each other,” they write."

As experts see it, his story is an object lesson in the pitfalls of handing influential foreign posts to diplomatic naïfs, while stripping oversight from the career officials at the State Department and the National Security Council.

“I told the Europeans, maybe this is the best you can expect” from the Trump administration, said Daniel Fried, a former longtime diplomat now with the Atlantic Council. No one imagined, he said, that Mr. Sondland would become a pivotal player “in this bottomless pit” of scandal.

Mr. Sondland, 62, tall and bald, is far from a typical diplomat. Foul-mouthed and unafraid to bruise egos, he craves the limelight, not policy papers and the politics of quiet persuasion that are the staples of diplomacy.

He nonetheless fits a certain mold of ambassadors: The founder of a boutique hotel chain, he landed his post after decades of work bankrolling Republican presidential candidates, including John McCain, Mitt Romney and George W. Bush and his brother Jeb Bush. In Bush family circles, he was particularly well liked.

“There aren’t many people who do it as well as he does,” David Nierenberg, an investment manager in Washington State who worked on Mr. Romney’s campaigns, said of Mr. Sondland’s fund-raising prowess. “He knew how to deliver.”

[Here are 15 times President Trump and his allies have claimed “no quid pro quo.”]

One involved $391 million in military aid to Ukraine, which has been battling Russian-backed separatists since 2014.

Mr. Trump froze those funds after they were approved by Congress. Then, in a July 25 phone call, he asked the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to open an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son and another into a theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. That theory has been debunked by the F.B.I. and CrowdStrike, the California cybersecurity company that investigated Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s emails in 2016.

On Thursday, Mr. Mulvaney became the first White House official to publicly say the release of military aid was connected in part to Mr. Trump’s political demands. But he did not use the term “quid pro quo.” Later in the day, he released a statement denying that any quid pro quo existed."

“Send Quid Pro Joe Biden into retirement,” a narrator in the ad intoned.

The video wasn’t released by the Trump campaign, which has produced ads on Facebook with similar accusations in recent weeks.

In the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, the Biden campaign acknowledged that Facebook had a policy of allowing all political leaders’ speech and ads to remain up because the company considers them to be newsworthy. But the ad by the super PAC was not from a politician, the Biden campaign wrote, so it needed to be rejected.

Speaking at a campaign rally hours after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered a cease-fire, Mr. Trump defended his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, effectively clearing the way for a brutal Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters who had fought for years alongside the United States against the Islamic State.

The president’s decision to pull out drew rebukes from both Democrats and Republicans, who accused him of abandoning America’s friends.

Surely, we Republicans aren’t that desperate for victory.”

Senator Smith surely knew her “Declaration of Conscience” would not carry the day. Her appeal to the better angels of her party was not made in the expectation of an immediate change; sometimes the point is just to get people to look up. In the end, four more years passed before the bulk of the Republican Party looked up and turned on Senator McCarthy — four years of public show trials and thought policing that pushed the country so hard to the right that the effects lasted decades. The problem with politicians who abuse power isn’t that they don’t get results. It’s that the results come at a high cost to the Republic — and to the reputations of those who lack the courage or wisdom to resist.

The Republican Party is again confronting a crisis of conscience, one that has been gathering force ever since Donald Trump captured the party’s nomination in 2016. Afraid of his political influence, and delighted with his largely conservative agenda, party leaders have compromised again and again, swallowing their criticisms and tacitly if not openly endorsing presidential behavior they would have excoriated in a Democrat. Compromise by compromise, Donald Trump has hammered away at what Republicans once saw as foundational virtues: decency, honesty, responsibility. He has asked them to substitute loyalty to him for their patriotism itself.

Mr. Trump privately pressed Ukraine to serve his political interests by investigating a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as by looking into a long-debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic National Committee emails that were stolen by the Russians. Mr. Trump publicly made a similar request of China. His chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said publicly on Thursday that the administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine if it did not help “find” the D.N.C. servers ."

It’s a common Trumpist strategy to brazenly admit crimes in public, disorienting people through sheer shamelessness. It’s also common for Trumpists to do what Mulvaney did a few hours later, when he issued a statement denying that he’d said what we all heard him say. (“Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,” Mulvaney wrote.)

But Sondland’s not really a Trumpist. Based on news reports, he mostly just seems like an insecure opportunist. According to The Post, Sondland had envied some of his rich friends who’d been given ambassadorships in the past, and coveted one of his own. I can understand the longing for honor and status. What confounds me is how anyone could think that working for Trump might provide these things, and not see that any title achieved in this crime-syndicate administration will always come with an asterisk after it, or worse."

“The thing about a quid pro quo,” Professor Butler added, “is it makes the conduct look like a shakedown.”

How is this involved in the impeachment inquiry?

The public so far knows of a few possible quid pro quos that may have been involved in the dealings between Ukraine and Mr. Trump and his associates.

[Here are 15 times President Trump and his allies have claimed “no quid pro quo.”]

One involved $391 million in military aid to Ukraine, which has been battling Russian-backed separatists since 2014.

Mr. Trump froze those funds after they were approved by Congress. Then, in a July 25 phone call, he asked the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to open an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son and another into a theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. That theory has been debunked by the F.B.I. and CrowdStrike, the California cybersecurity company that investigated Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s emails in 2016.

On Thursday, Mr. Mulvaney became the first White House official to publicly say the release of military aid was connected in part to Mr. Trump’s political demands. But he did not use the term “quid pro quo.” Later in the day, he released a statement denying that any quid pro quo existed."

The debate has put the issue on the front burner. “I don’t think she should just rubber-stamp Bernie’s bill,” said Eric Potter, a retired insurance claims representative from Virginia Beach, Va., referring to Sen. Bernie Sanders’s health proposal.

His wife, Susan, a retired attorney, said at the senator’s Norfolk town hall Friday evening she was surprised to learn in recent weeks that Ms. Warren hasn’t released her own health-care plan. Mrs. Potter said she notices the senator proclaims she is “with Bernie” on health care, although she has presented her own plans on many other topics, like higher education.

“For such a smart person who thinks things out, that’s kind of lazy for her to say,” said Mrs. Potter, who wore a “Warren” ball cap. She and her husband said they plan to support Ms. Warren in the primary, and both expect the senator to release a health-care plan soon. Ms. Potter predicted a Warren plan would “be better than what the [other candidates] have out.”

Ms. Warren’s campaign has declined to say whether it is drafting its own proposal. But her top aides have been calling health care experts in recent weeks as it examines revenue models to fund Medicare for All. A representative for the Warren campaign declined to comment for this article.

Ms. Warren faced sustained criticism at Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, following her steady rise in the crowded primary field. Her more moderate rivals in the party, from former Vice President Joe Biden to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, questioned how she would pay for a universal health-care proposal. And there are early signs that support for Medicare for All is slipping.

Mr. Sanders has said taxes would go up to finance Medicare for All, but the increases would be more than offset by lower health-care costs. Asked directly, Ms. Warren has avoided the question of whether the middle class would pay more in taxes—something her rivals have pounced on. “At least Bernie’s being honest here,” Ms. Klobuchar said at the debate.

Ms. Warren hasn’t said whether middle-class taxes would increase because the exact cost of Medicare for All is unclear, given that there are several versions of the framework produced by lawmakers and economists, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. A person familiar with the senator’s thinking said she has chosen to stick to the broader principle that overall costs will go down and that the wealthy will pay more.

“The overall structure is that the very wealthy and big corporations will see their costs go up, but middle-class families will see their costs go down,” Ms. Warren told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month. “That is how [middle-class families] frame the problem: what their costs will be. And their costs will go down.”

Plans to end the current U.S. health system for a new federally-run program come with widely divergent estimated costs, ranging from $13.8 trillion to as much as $36 trillion over 10 years, The Journal has previously reported.

Some 4,000 people attended Friday’s event, according to the campaign. Some attendees, including Ryan Witt, a 28-year-old electrician, wore shirts bearing one of the campaign’s slogans: “Warren has a plan for that.”

Mr. Witt said it isn’t lost on him that Ms. Warren hasn’t presented a full plan on health care. He also notices that she won’t say outright whether the middle class would pay more in taxes under Medicare for All.

“She hasn’t straight said it, but as I understand it, taxes would go up,” Mr. Witt said, adding that he would find a higher tax bill acceptable if the revenue was used to expand health care access to more people.

He said Ms. Warren faces a dilemma. “If she did say it, ’more taxes,’ it would alienate some people. On the other hand, I have heard some others, some of my friends, that say it’s kind of shady to not say it,” Mr. Witt said.

He plans to support Ms. Warren in the primary. What’s his advice to her on the health-care dilemma he described? “I say if you’re going to do it, own it.”

Biden Jr. of blackmailing Ukrainian officials to stop an investigation of his son.

“Send Quid Pro Joe Biden into retirement,” a narrator in the ad intoned.

The video wasn’t released by the Trump campaign, which has produced ads on Facebook with similar accusations in recent weeks. Instead, it was made by an independent political action committee, or super PAC. And it was allowed to run on Facebook with false information, in violation of the social network’s policies on misinformation, the Biden presidential campaign wrote in a letter to Facebook on Thursday.

In the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, the Biden campaign acknowledged that Facebook had a policy of allowing all political leaders’ speech and ads to remain up because the company considers them to be newsworthy. But the ad by the super PAC was not from a politician, the Biden campaign wrote, so it needed to be rejected.

“This is a most basic test,” Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said in the letter. “The ad contains transparently false allegations, prominently debunked by every major media outlet in the country over recent weeks. It should be rejected.”"

Surely, we Republicans aren’t that desperate for victory.”

Senator Smith surely knew her “Declaration of Conscience” would not carry the day. Her appeal to the better angels of her party was not made in the expectation of an immediate change; sometimes the point is just to get people to look up. In the end, four more years passed before the bulk of the Republican Party looked up and turned on Senator McCarthy — four years of public show trials and thought policing that pushed the country so hard to the right that the effects lasted decades. The problem with politicians who abuse power isn’t that they don’t get results. It’s that the results come at a high cost to the Republic — and to the reputations of those who lack the courage or wisdom to resist.

The Republican Party is again confronting a crisis of conscience, one that has been gathering force ever since Donald Trump captured the party’s nomination in 2016. Afraid of his political influence, and delighted with his largely conservative agenda, party leaders have compromised again and again, swallowing their criticisms and tacitly if not openly endorsing presidential behavior they would have excoriated in a Democrat. Compromise by compromise, Donald Trump has hammered away at what Republicans once saw as foundational virtues: decency, honesty, responsibility. He has asked them to substitute loyalty to him for their patriotism itself.

Mr. Trump privately pressed Ukraine to serve his political interests by investigating a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as by looking into a long-debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic National Committee emails that were stolen by the Russians. Mr. Trump publicly made a similar request of China. His chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said publicly on Thursday that the administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine if it did not help “find” the D.N.C. servers ."

Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived.

Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers’ unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. “The focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,” said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren."

Is Hillary Clinton trolling us?

Over the past two weeks, Mrs. Clinton has called President Trump a “corrupt human tornado.” She’s refused to appear on a panel with Kirstjen Nielsen, the former homeland security secretary best known for separating migrant children from their families. She’s picked a fight with Representative Tulsi Gabbard, suggesting that the Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate is a favorite of the Russians. And she’s tweeted a letter mocking Mr. Trump with language that makes it unprintable in this family newsletter.

Welcome to Hillary Unplugged.

For most of her public career, Mrs. Clinton has been constrained by the expectations of her position, be it first lady, senator or secretary of state. Now, after her stunning loss in 2016, it seems she finally feels liberated to speak her mind.

And she’s certainly stirring up a lot of drama while doing it. The two-time Democratic presidential candidate continues to loom large in the psyche of her party — both as heroine and villain.

Some Democrats celebrate seeing Mrs. Clinton giving zero, uh, cares. Others, like Ms. Gabbard, see her criticism as a different kind of badge of honor.

“I thought I was doing something very good for our country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 leaders,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter before again promoting the resort’s amenities. “But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!”

Mr. Trump added, “Therefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020.”

Mr. Trump suggested as a possibility Camp David, the rustic, official presidential retreat that Mr. Mulvaney had denigrated as an option when he announced the choice of Doral. But Mr. Mulvaney said the president was candid in his disappointment.

The president’s reaction “out in the tweet was real,” Mr. Mulvaney said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The president isn’t one for holding back his feelings and his emotions about something. He was honestly surprised at the level of pushback.”

Mr. Trump’s unhappiness may also extend to Mr. Mulvaney, who at his Thursday news conference — whose intended subject was the summit hotel choice — essentially acknowledged that the president had a quid pro quo in mind in discussions with Ukrainian officials.

But advisers to Mr. Trump were stunned. The president has frequently expressed unhappiness with Mr. Mulvaney to others, and he recently reached out to Nick Ayers, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence, to see if he had interest in returning, according to two people close to the president. Mr. Ayers is unlikely to return to Washington, but the conversation speaks to Mr. Trump’s mindset at a time when he is being urged by some advisers to make a change, and several people close to the president said Mr. Mulvaney did not help himself in the past week."

Now we have so much ammunition we don't know what to do with it."" — Dallas rally Thursday.

THE FACTS: Trump periodically quotes unidentified generals as saying things that he wants to hear and that are hard to imagine them actually having said. This is no exception. The U.S. doesn't go to war without sufficient ammunition.

At most, budget constraints may have restricted ammunition for certain training exercises at times and held back the development of new forms of firepower. It's not unusual for generals to want more people and equipment at their disposal than they have. But they don't run out of bullets.

[LAUGHS]

[music]

michael barbaro

Nick Fandos covers Congress for The Times. Nick, where did we leave off with you last week?

nicholas fandos

So remember, last week we heard testimony from a string of American diplomats, both career diplomats and political appointees working for Donald Trump. And what they describe day after day in testimony was, essentially, the traditional American foreign policy apparatus getting sidelined or pushed aside by President Trump, his personal lawyer, and a cadre of political appointees who were close around him and were setting the agenda for the country’s policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Right. And the names that kept coming up again and again were Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland?

nicholas fandos

That’s right. And by Thursday, we heard from Sondland himself, who you’ll remember is the ambassador to the European Union. He’s a former Trump political donor. Sondland, after witness after witness this week had placed him at the center of this shadow foreign policy, if you will, came in and essentially said, hey, I know there’s all this attention on me, but I was merely following the directions of President Trump.

michael barbaro

And Nick, what did we hear in this testimony about what the point of this shadow structure was? Why have it? What are they up to?

nicholas fandos

So a lot of this testimony revolved around a meeting that the Ukrainians wanted to have with President Trump at the White House that they believed would lend credibility to the new administration in that country. And the questions that came up again and again were, was there a quid pro quo that the Trump administration was trying to extract investigations from the Ukrainians into the president’s political rivals in exchange for that meeting? That they were holding out that meeting and saying, we’ll only give you this if we get what we want. But what’s interesting is what they weren’t testifying about. For the most part, there was very little discussion last week of the military aid that President Trump had ordered to be frozen this summer. This is almost $400 million in security funds that Congress allocated in a bipartisan fashion for Ukraine. And there have been allegations, first from the whistle-blower that initiated this case and throughout, that that aid may have been frozen as a leverage point as well, as another kind of quid pro quo to extract these politically advantageous investigations. But we weren’t hearing a whole lot about that as the week wore on.

michael barbaro

Right. There were two allegations of a quid pro quo. There was the White House visit in exchange for these investigations, and then there was this $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. And my sense is that the allegation that the military aid had been held up in this scheme was by far the more explosive of the two.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Remember, when House Democrats launched this impeachment inquiry a little bit more than a month ago, it was the prospect of $400 million in bipartisan approved military aid that had most alarmed lawmakers in both parties. It’s that military aid that got moderate Democrats, the ones from swing districts that President Trump won in 2016 who are kind of teetering on the edge as they face re-election, to come on board and say, yes, we do support an inquiry. They threw crucial support behind this investigation explicitly because it was tied to national security.

michael barbaro

Right. And what did you make of the fact that the money, which had been the source of so much focus, wasn’t really coming up? Did that at all cause you to wonder, as I will admit it did for me, if the military aid aspect of the story maybe just wasn’t there? If it hadn’t maybe been something that the president was holding over Ukraine to get these investigations he wanted into the Democrats?

nicholas fandos

I think that that certainly began to feel like more of a possibility. The Trump administration has given publicly other reasons for withholding this aid. And in some respects, it makes sense that they would have withheld it when they were looking to cut down on the expensive foreign aid all over the country. So —

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

— I wouldn’t have been altogether surprised if that part of the story continued to shrink away. At the same time, so much of what the original whistle-blower — who has brought this case to the fore, who helped launch this impeachment inquiry indirectly — has alleged has borne out to date, that I don’t think we could fully rule out the idea that the aid had been held up as leverage for these investigations. And so it just remained a kind of open, tantalizing question, will this bear out or won’t it? And that’s where we pick things up this week.

michael barbaro

O.K., so get us up to speed about what actually happened on Tuesday.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday morning, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine right now, arrived on Capitol Hill for his own deposition with House impeachment investigators.

michael barbaro

And what we need to know about Bill Taylor besides that?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor is another one of these career national security officials who has served Democrats and Republicans. He’s been serving the country, he told investigators today, for 50 years, starting as a cadet at West Point, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem. During George W. Bush’s administration, he was an ambassador to Ukraine. And he had actually retired when the State Department contacted him early this year, after Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, was ousted by President Trump, and asked him if he’d be willing to come back to take control of the American mission in Ukraine and help to implement the president’s policies. And he began explaining to investigators today that he knew, in a sense, what he was getting into, and he had real pause as he looked toward taking this job. He sought assurances from the State Department, essentially, that he would be able to exercise policy as he saw fit and that he wasn’t going to be a victim of the same kind of political games that she was. With those assurances, he ultimately decided in May that he would sign up. And he flew over to Kiev and began his role as ambassador. What came next, he made pretty clear, is something like his worst nightmare.

[music]

nicholas fandos

And on Tuesday, he outlined that nightmare in a 15-page opening statement, which he read methodically over 40 minutes —

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

— to investigators gathered behind closed doors.

michael barbaro

And what does he say in this opening statement?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor begins a lot — like a lot of witnesses last week began. He describes two channels of foreign policy, an official channel and the kind of shadow or irregular channel, toward Ukraine. And he says basically, at first, these things are aligned. He told investigators, when I first arrived in Kiev in June and July, the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy served the same goal — a strong U.S.-Ukrainian partnership. But what he documents in copious notes and calls that he reconstructs and experiences that he has with other diplomats involved is a divergence of those two channels, a disintegration of the first one, essentially, in favor of the second. And he says, it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives.

michael barbaro

And what happened that led him to feel by August that there were two different sets of priorities here, that these things were no longer in line?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not long after Taylor arrives in Ukraine that it becomes increasingly clear to him that something funny is going on. At first, he hears from Ambassador Sondland that what the president really wants from the new Ukrainian leadership is a commitment to investigate his political opponents, the Bidens, and a conspiracy theory about Democratic and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and that to secure a visit to the White House, a visit that the Ukrainians badly want, will be contingent upon them publicly committing to conducting those investigations. As the summer goes on, he learns in July that, inexplicably and despite the guidance of the Defense Department and the State Department, the president has ordered the Office of Management and Budget to freeze the $400 million in security aid that is meant to be delivered to the Ukrainians. Taylor is completely alarmed by this. Remember, Taylor really knows the threat to Ukraine well, and he understands the power that this money has to help prop up its military. But what he doesn’t understand is why, at first, the money is being held up. And he describes, shortly after hearing that it’s going to be withheld, traveling to the northern border of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are coming into contact with mounting hostile Russian-led forces, and thinking to himself, “I know this aid is being withheld, and these guys don’t.” And this is the face of the threat. More Ukrainians are going to die if the United States assistance does not come through.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

And so he is really shaken by this and describes a series of meetings where he and others are trying to push to get it reinstated. And it’s around this time, Taylor testifies, he got on the phone with Sondland. And Sondland essentially said to him that everything, the White House meeting and the aid, were contingent upon the Ukrainians committing to these investigations. He said Sondland drew an analogy. He said, think of the president like a businessman. And when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that that person pay up before signing the check.” Now, Taylor is completely taken aback by this. In his view, the analogy doesn’t make any sense. Why would the Ukrainians owe President Trump anything?

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

The security systems had been allocated. And its delivery made sense not just for the Ukrainians, but for the United States’s strategic interest. So this is a kind of key seam that, to him, exposes that to President Trump and those who are enabling him in this effort, it’s not about America’s national security. It’s just about these investigations. And that is what the president is after. That’s the sole goal of his foreign policy here, of this second channel that broke off from the first and seems to be, at this point, more or less the one that matters to the White House.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Nick, how do you find out about all this testimony on Tuesday?

nicholas fandos

So Tuesday was another long day outside of the House Intelligence Committee SCIF. But it was a little unusual in that not long after the testimony began, Democrats began to come out —

archived recording (eric swalwell) I’m not going to comment on what he said inside there.

nicholas fandos

— and, without giving specifics, essentially say on the record —

archived recording (andy levin) In my 10 short months in Congress, this is the — my most disturbing day in Congress so far.

nicholas fandos

This is a pretty remarkable thing we’ve just heard.

archived recording (ted lieu) And his opening statement is devastating to Donald Trump.

nicholas fandos

This may be the most significant testimony yet.

archived recording (ted lieu) It was very damning for the president.

nicholas fandos

And they all walk out with copies of his 15-page opening statement in their hands, but none of them will give it up to the press. So you know, I basically spent hours running around, working the phones, trying to get my hands on this piece of paper. And only by the early afternoon was I able to get a copy and start reading it and making sense of it.

michael barbaro

And Nick, is a lot of what these Democrats are so excited about, outside this secure room where you’re waiting on Tuesday, is that now the money, the military aid, is back in the picture? It’s now showing up in these hearings after a week where it had not been present.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right. I mean, what they got with Bill Taylor today was somebody who had been there, had had a front seat to this whole story, come in and say, yeah, this thing in the middle, the military aid, the kind of — the worst possible thing in all of these allegations, that happened. That was true, and here’s why that matters. Democrats will tell you that any quid pro quo in this case is inappropriate. Even withholding a White House meeting is inappropriate and potentially impeachable from their point of view. But it’s the security aid, the withholding of a significant chunk of money that Republicans and Democrats both support, that they think is an obvious step for the United States to take for its own interests and to help its allies in Europe. That that would be withheld is, in political terms, kind of another magnitude of significance. And it’s the thing that Democrats think Republicans and, frankly, voters around the country are more likely to be convinced by. That hundreds of millions of dollars in hard military aid to fight a conflict against the Russians just resonates more with people. That’s a bigger kind of thing to be messing around with than a meeting at the White House, which most people don’t know why a meeting gets scheduled or doesn’t get scheduled. So by reinserting the military aid into the center of this, it reopens the possibility that this case could become more than a partisan exercise.

michael barbaro

But Nick, as you said, the whole impeachment inquiry began with a phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, in which military aid appeared to be withheld in exchange for these investigations that Trump wants. What’s different about what happened on Tuesday that makes it such a big deal?

nicholas fandos

So what we had before was an anonymous allegation from a whistle-blower whose information didn’t seem to be firsthand. And in any case, the public doesn’t know who that whistle-blower is. They can’t evaluate that person’s claims. What we had on Tuesday was the top American diplomat in Ukraine, the guy who was supposed to be managing the relationship between the two countries, coming forward and testifying on the record, before Congress, that he saw a quid pro quo, that he saw the aid being withheld to extract political gain for the president of the United States. And he offered an authoritative, detailed and vivid account of how that went down. And that goes a long way. It’s not the whole case, but it goes a long way in establishing for Democrats and for this investigation that what they suspected, what was initially alleged, did, in fact, occur.

michael barbaro

So at this point, what was first an anonymous allegation delivered by a whistle-blower was just very much confirmed by an ambassador under oath, like you just said. So what more evidence do people on the impeachment inquiry committees need, do you think, to vote to impeach the president?

nicholas fandos

So I think what they want is to continue moving towards these kind of inner concentric circles. So if they’ve talked to the ambassador now, next they want to hear from the White House budget office to hear what order exactly came down from President Trump to suspend the aid. What did that sound like? What did people in the office think? What debate happened there? They want to know what was happening in the National Security Council, where advisers and aides to the president were listening to a lot of these calls and interactions in real time, not to mention talking with him, and will have their own accounts as to what was going down. So basically, if Taylor has sketched in this important part of the picture, they’re looking for additional witnesses that are kind of even closer to the action to fill in kind of flourishes and details that will either back up or disprove what he had to say. Because ultimately, what this is really about is about President Trump. You’re not impeaching these other officials around him. The House would vote to impeach President Trump. And they need to be able to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt in the Senate. And so what they’re really after is as precise and vivid a picture as possible of what President Trump was doing and saying and meaning as he took these actions.

michael barbaro

Right. They want the closest thing possible to direct, irrefutable evidence that the president himself said, withhold this money until I get my investigation. And it sounds like on Tuesday, they got a lot closer to that, but perhaps not all the way.

nicholas fandos

That’s right, and that’s why the investigation will keep grinding on.

Charles Barone, the group’s chief policy officer, said that while he welcomed big new investments in education, including in teacher pay, he was disappointed that the primary contenders had not tackled specific problems such as weaknesses in how educators are trained to teach children to read.

“There is a political tension between spreading the money around and trying to make strategic investments in certain areas,” he said. “There’s a lot of meat and potatoes, but not a lot of spinach-eating getting proposed.”

Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived.

That vision aligned with many in the charter school movement, who see their schools as lifelines for families who cannot afford private school tuition or a home in a coveted school zone.

But in 2016, Ms. Warren, then in her first term as a senator from Massachusetts, spoke out against a ballot referendum that would have raised the cap on the number of charters that could open each year in her home state. She acknowledged that many Massachusetts charter schools were high-performing, but said that opening too many additional charters could reduce funding for traditional public schools.

Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers’ unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. “The focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,” said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren."

I think that that certainly began to feel like more of a possibility. The Trump administration has given publicly other reasons for withholding this aid. And in some respects, it makes sense that they would have withheld it when they were looking to cut down on the expensive foreign aid all over the country. So —

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

— I wouldn’t have been altogether surprised if that part of the story continued to shrink away. At the same time, so much of what the original whistle-blower — who has brought this case to the fore, who helped launch this impeachment inquiry indirectly — has alleged has borne out to date, that I don’t think we could fully rule out the idea that the aid had been held up as leverage for these investigations. And so it just remained a kind of open, tantalizing question, will this bear out or won’t it? And that’s where we pick things up this week.

michael barbaro

O.K., so get us up to speed about what actually happened on Tuesday.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday morning, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine right now, arrived on Capitol Hill for his own deposition with House impeachment investigators.

michael barbaro

And what we need to know about Bill Taylor besides that?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor is another one of these career national security officials who has served Democrats and Republicans. He’s been serving the country, he told investigators today, for 50 years, starting as a cadet at West Point, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem. During George W. Bush’s administration, he was an ambassador to Ukraine. And he had actually retired when the State Department contacted him early this year, after Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, was ousted by President Trump, and asked him if he’d be willing to come back to take control of the American mission in Ukraine and help to implement the president’s policies. And he began explaining to investigators today that he knew, in a sense, what he was getting into, and he had real pause as he looked toward taking this job. He sought assurances from the State Department, essentially, that he would be able to exercise policy as he saw fit and that he wasn’t going to be a victim of the same kind of political games that she was. With those assurances, he ultimately decided in May that he would sign up. And he flew over to Kiev and began his role as ambassador. What came next, he made pretty clear, is something like his worst nightmare.

[music]

nicholas fandos

And on Tuesday, he outlined that nightmare in a 15-page opening statement, which he read methodically over 40 minutes —

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

— to investigators gathered behind closed doors.

michael barbaro

And what does he say in this opening statement?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor begins a lot — like a lot of witnesses last week began. He describes two channels of foreign policy, an official channel and the kind of shadow or irregular channel, toward Ukraine. And he says basically, at first, these things are aligned. He told investigators, when I first arrived in Kiev in June and July, the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy served the same goal — a strong U.S.-Ukrainian partnership. But what he documents in copious notes and calls that he reconstructs and experiences that he has with other diplomats involved is a divergence of those two channels, a disintegration of the first one, essentially, in favor of the second. And he says, it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives.

michael barbaro

And what happened that led him to feel by August that there were two different sets of priorities here, that these things were no longer in line?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not long after Taylor arrives in Ukraine that it becomes increasingly clear to him that something funny is going on. At first, he hears from Ambassador Sondland that what the president really wants from the new Ukrainian leadership is a commitment to investigate his political opponents, the Bidens, and a conspiracy theory about Democratic and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and that to secure a visit to the White House, a visit that the Ukrainians badly want, will be contingent upon them publicly committing to conducting those investigations. As the summer goes on, he learns in July that, inexplicably and despite the guidance of the Defense Department and the State Department, the president has ordered the Office of Management and Budget to freeze the $400 million in security aid that is meant to be delivered to the Ukrainians. Taylor is completely alarmed by this. Remember, Taylor really knows the threat to Ukraine well, and he understands the power that this money has to help prop up its military. But what he doesn’t understand is why, at first, the money is being held up. And he describes, shortly after hearing that it’s going to be withheld, traveling to the northern border of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are coming into contact with mounting hostile Russian-led forces, and thinking to himself, “I know this aid is being withheld, and these guys don’t.” And this is the face of the threat. More Ukrainians are going to die if the United States assistance does not come through.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

And so he is really shaken by this and describes a series of meetings where he and others are trying to push to get it reinstated. And it’s around this time, Taylor testifies, he got on the phone with Sondland. And Sondland essentially said to him that everything, the White House meeting and the aid, were contingent upon the Ukrainians committing to these investigations. He said Sondland drew an analogy. He said, think of the president like a businessman. And when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that that person pay up before signing the check.” Now, Taylor is completely taken aback by this. In his view, the analogy doesn’t make any sense. Why would the Ukrainians owe President Trump anything?

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

The security systems had been allocated. And its delivery made sense not just for the Ukrainians, but for the United States’s strategic interest. So this is a kind of key seam that, to him, exposes that to President Trump and those who are enabling him in this effort, it’s not about America’s national security. It’s just about these investigations. And that is what the president is after. That’s the sole goal of his foreign policy here, of this second channel that broke off from the first and seems to be, at this point, more or less the one that matters to the White House.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Nick, how do you find out about all this testimony on Tuesday?

nicholas fandos

So Tuesday was another long day outside of the House Intelligence Committee SCIF. But it was a little unusual in that not long after the testimony began, Democrats began to come out —

archived recording (eric swalwell) I’m not going to comment on what he said inside there.

nicholas fandos

— and, without giving specifics, essentially say on the record —

nicholas fandos

This is a pretty remarkable thing we’ve just heard.

archived recording (ted lieu) And his opening statement is devastating to Donald Trump.

nicholas fandos

This may be the most significant testimony yet.

archived recording (ted lieu) It was very damning for the president.

nicholas fandos

And they all walk out with copies of his 15-page opening statement in their hands, but none of them will give it up to the press. So you know, I basically spent hours running around, working the phones, trying to get my hands on this piece of paper. And only by the early afternoon was I able to get a copy and start reading it and making sense of it.

michael barbaro

And Nick, is a lot of what these Democrats are so excited about, outside this secure room where you’re waiting on Tuesday, is that now the money, the military aid, is back in the picture? It’s now showing up in these hearings after a week where it had not been present.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right. I mean, what they got with Bill Taylor today was somebody who had been there, had had a front seat to this whole story, come in and say, yeah, this thing in the middle, the military aid, the kind of — the worst possible thing in all of these allegations, that happened. That was true, and here’s why that matters. Democrats will tell you that any quid pro quo in this case is inappropriate. Even withholding a White House meeting is inappropriate and potentially impeachable from their point of view. But it’s the security aid, the withholding of a significant chunk of money that Republicans and Democrats both support, that they think is an obvious step for the United States to take for its own interests and to help its allies in Europe. That that would be withheld is, in political terms, kind of another magnitude of significance. And it’s the thing that Democrats think Republicans and, frankly, voters around the country are more likely to be convinced by. That hundreds of millions of dollars in hard military aid to fight a conflict against the Russians just resonates more with people. That’s a bigger kind of thing to be messing around with than a meeting at the White House, which most people don’t know why a meeting gets scheduled or doesn’t get scheduled. So by reinserting the military aid into the center of this, it reopens the possibility that this case could become more than a partisan exercise.

michael barbaro

But Nick, as you said, the whole impeachment inquiry began with a phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, in which military aid appeared to be withheld in exchange for these investigations that Trump wants. What’s different about what happened on Tuesday that makes it such a big deal?

nicholas fandos

So what we had before was an anonymous allegation from a whistle-blower whose information didn’t seem to be firsthand. And in any case, the public doesn’t know who that whistle-blower is. They can’t evaluate that person’s claims. What we had on Tuesday was the top American diplomat in Ukraine, the guy who was supposed to be managing the relationship between the two countries, coming forward and testifying on the record, before Congress, that he saw a quid pro quo, that he saw the aid being withheld to extract political gain for the president of the United States. And he offered an authoritative, detailed and vivid account of how that went down. And that goes a long way. It’s not the whole case, but it goes a long way in establishing for Democrats and for this investigation that what they suspected, what was initially alleged, did, in fact, occur.

michael barbaro

So at this point, what was first an anonymous allegation delivered by a whistle-blower was just very much confirmed by an ambassador under oath, like you just said. So what more evidence do people on the impeachment inquiry committees need, do you think, to vote to impeach the president?

nicholas fandos

So I think what they want is to continue moving towards these kind of inner concentric circles. So if they’ve talked to the ambassador now, next they want to hear from the White House budget office to hear what order exactly came down from President Trump to suspend the aid. What did that sound like? What did people in the office think? What debate happened there? They want to know what was happening in the National Security Council, where advisers and aides to the president were listening to a lot of these calls and interactions in real time, not to mention talking with him, and will have their own accounts as to what was going down. So basically, if Taylor has sketched in this important part of the picture, they’re looking for additional witnesses that are kind of even closer to the action to fill in kind of flourishes and details that will either back up or disprove what he had to say. Because ultimately, what this is really about is about President Trump. You’re not impeaching these other officials around him. The House would vote to impeach President Trump. And they need to be able to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt in the Senate. And so what they’re really after is as precise and vivid a picture as possible of what President Trump was doing and saying and meaning as he took these actions.

michael barbaro

Right. They want the closest thing possible to direct, irrefutable evidence that the president himself said, withhold this money until I get my investigation. And it sounds like on Tuesday, they got a lot closer to that, but perhaps not all the way.

nicholas fandos

That’s right, and that’s why the investigation will keep grinding on.

Is Hillary Clinton trolling us?

Over the past two weeks, Mrs. Clinton has called President Trump a “corrupt human tornado.” She’s refused to appear on a panel with Kirstjen Nielsen, the former homeland security secretary best known for separating migrant children from their families. She’s picked a fight with Representative Tulsi Gabbard, suggesting that the Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate is a favorite of the Russians. And she’s tweeted a letter mocking Mr. Trump with language that makes it unprintable in this family newsletter.

Welcome to Hillary Unplugged.

For most of her public career, Mrs. Clinton has been constrained by the expectations of her position, be it first lady, senator or secretary of state. Now, after her stunning loss in 2016, it seems she finally feels liberated to speak her mind.

And she’s certainly stirring up a lot of drama while doing it. The two-time Democratic presidential candidate continues to loom large in the psyche of her party — both as heroine and villain.

Some Democrats celebrate seeing Mrs. Clinton giving zero, uh, cares. Others, like Ms. Gabbard, see her criticism as a different kind of badge of honor. Several people who have spoken to Ms. Gabbard say privately that her team loves the controversy, seeing Mrs. Clinton as a perfect establishment foil for their stuck-in-the-single-digits campaign."

“I thought I was doing something very good for our country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 leaders,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter before again promoting the resort’s amenities. “But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!”

Mr. Trump added, “Therefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020.”

Mr. Trump suggested as a possibility Camp David, the rustic, official presidential retreat that Mr. Mulvaney had denigrated as an option when he announced the choice of Doral. But Mr. Mulvaney said the president was candid in his disappointment.

The president’s reaction “out in the tweet was real,” Mr. Mulvaney said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The president isn’t one for holding back his feelings and his emotions about something. He was honestly surprised at the level of pushback.”

Mr. Trump’s unhappiness may also extend to Mr. Mulvaney, who at his Thursday news conference — whose intended subject was the summit hotel choice — essentially acknowledged that the president had a quid pro quo in mind in discussions with Ukrainian officials.

But advisers to Mr. Trump were stunned. The president has frequently expressed unhappiness with Mr. Mulvaney to others, and he recently reached out to Nick Ayers, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence, to see if he had interest in returning, according to two people close to the president. Mr. Ayers is unlikely to return to Washington, but the conversation speaks to Mr. Trump’s mindset at a time when he is being urged by some advisers to make a change, and several people close to the president said Mr. Mulvaney did not help himself in the past week."

As teachers have marched through downtown and picketed outside schools in recent days, they have often been greeted by supportive car honks and parents offering apple cider and doughnuts. But Ms. Lightfoot and her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel , whose tenure included an especially bitter teachers’ strike in 2012, have struggled to reconcile demands from the union with the bleak finances of the city and the school system.

“Beyond what we put on the table, there is simply no more money,” Ms. Lightfoot said, taking a noticeably harsher tone this week than in the first days of the strike. She added: “Enough is enough. There is no further excuse to keep our kids out of school.”

“She has her right to come in,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “I would expect all Democratic candidates for the presidency to support workers. That’s who we are as a party. But at the end of the day, what’s going to get it done is what happens at the bargaining table.”

Republicans were also skeptical of the visit.

“Teachers should be wary of any advice Elizabeth Warren may be relaying today in Chicago,” said Kevin Knoth, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee , in a statement that questioned the wisdom of Ms. Warren’s plan for spending billions of dollars more on education.

THE FACTS: Trump periodically quotes unidentified generals as saying things that he wants to hear and that are hard to imagine them actually having said. This is no exception. The U.S. doesn't go to war without sufficient ammunition.

At most, budget constraints may have restricted ammunition for certain training exercises at times and held back the development of new forms of firepower. It's not unusual for generals to want more people and equipment at their disposal than they have. But they don't run out of bullets.

Mr. Biden had also tweeted an apology on Tuesday for using the term.

“I was wrong to have said it and I apologize for having said it,” Mr. Biden said on Wednesday.

But he also criticized Mr. Trump for using the term “lynching,” with its legacy of racist murders of African-Americans, to describe the impeachment inquiry he currently faces. Mr. Trump, he argued, was using the term “as a dog whistle.”

“When has he ever taken, when has he ever said a negative thing about a white supremacist?” Mr. Biden said of the president. “Have you heard him say anything? I haven’t.”

Mr. Biden’s appearance in Scranton came the same day that a new CNN national poll showed him with a commanding lead in the Democratic primary, with the support of 34 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters, followed by Ms. Warren at 19 percent and Senator Bernie Sanders at 16 percent. It is Mr. Biden’s widest lead in the CNN survey since shortly after he announced his bid for president.

But there is no national primary, of course, and Mr. Biden’s advantage in the early-primary states Iowa and New Hampshire has ebbed or evaporated. The CNN survey is a sign that nationally he has retained strong support despite facing weeks of unproved attacks by Mr. Trump on him and his son Hunter over their activities in Ukraine, an issue driving the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.

Mr. Biden’s economic prescriptions, less sweeping than those of other leading Democrats seeking the nomination, include a $15 federal minimum wage, tripling funding for schools with at-risk students, free community college and a plan for students to pay down their college debt by committing to community service.

Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate is only 3.9 percent, though it is 5.2 percent in Lackawanna County, where Scranton is.

He has a climate-focused TV ad in which he says, “I believe that we need to have a plan that works for all of us.” The border crossings issue, he told CNN last week, is “the kind of stuff that gets us trapped.” And he’s a month into an attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for not explaining how she’d pay for an overhaul of health care.

For most of his political career, Mr. Buttigieg presented himself as more of a centrist technocrat than a liberal ideologue.

And Nick, what did we hear in this testimony about what the point of this shadow structure was? Why have it? What are they up to?

nicholas fandos

So a lot of this testimony revolved around a meeting that the Ukrainians wanted to have with President Trump at the White House that they believed would lend credibility to the new administration in that country. And the questions that came up again and again were, was there a quid pro quo that the Trump administration was trying to extract investigations from the Ukrainians into the president’s political rivals in exchange for that meeting? That they were holding out that meeting and saying, we’ll only give you this if we get what we want. But what’s interesting is what they weren’t testifying about. For the most part, there was very little discussion last week of the military aid that President Trump had ordered to be frozen this summer. This is almost $400 million in security funds that Congress allocated in a bipartisan fashion for Ukraine. And there have been allegations, first from the whistle-blower that initiated this case and throughout, that that aid may have been frozen as a leverage point as well, as another kind of quid pro quo to extract these politically advantageous investigations. But we weren’t hearing a whole lot about that as the week wore on.

michael barbaro

Right. There were two allegations of a quid pro quo. There was the White House visit in exchange for these investigations, and then there was this $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. And my sense is that the allegation that the military aid had been held up in this scheme was by far the more explosive of the two.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Remember, when House Democrats launched this impeachment inquiry a little bit more than a month ago, it was the prospect of $400 million in bipartisan approved military aid that had most alarmed lawmakers in both parties. It’s that military aid that got moderate Democrats, the ones from swing districts that President Trump won in 2016 who are kind of teetering on the edge as they face re-election, to come on board and say, yes, we do support an inquiry. They threw crucial support behind this investigation explicitly because it was tied to national security.

michael barbaro

Right. And what did you make of the fact that the money, which had been the source of so much focus, wasn’t really coming up? Did that at all cause you to wonder, as I will admit it did for me, if the military aid aspect of the story maybe just wasn’t there? If it hadn’t maybe been something that the president was holding over Ukraine to get these investigations he wanted into the Democrats?

nicholas fandos

I think that that certainly began to feel like more of a possibility. The Trump administration has given publicly other reasons for withholding this aid. And in some respects, it makes sense that they would have withheld it when they were looking to cut down on the expensive foreign aid all over the country. So —

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

— I wouldn’t have been altogether surprised if that part of the story continued to shrink away. At the same time, so much of what the original whistle-blower — who has brought this case to the fore, who helped launch this impeachment inquiry indirectly — has alleged has borne out to date, that I don’t think we could fully rule out the idea that the aid had been held up as leverage for these investigations. And so it just remained a kind of open, tantalizing question, will this bear out or won’t it? And that’s where we pick things up this week.

michael barbaro

O.K., so get us up to speed about what actually happened on Tuesday.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday morning, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine right now, arrived on Capitol Hill for his own deposition with House impeachment investigators.

michael barbaro

And what we need to know about Bill Taylor besides that?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor is another one of these career national security officials who has served Democrats and Republicans. He’s been serving the country, he told investigators today, for 50 years, starting as a cadet at West Point, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem. During George W. Bush’s administration, he was an ambassador to Ukraine. And he had actually retired when the State Department contacted him early this year, after Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, was ousted by President Trump, and asked him if he’d be willing to come back to take control of the American mission in Ukraine and help to implement the president’s policies. And he began explaining to investigators today that he knew, in a sense, what he was getting into, and he had real pause as he looked toward taking this job. He sought assurances from the State Department, essentially, that he would be able to exercise policy as he saw fit and that he wasn’t going to be a victim of the same kind of political games that she was. With those assurances, he ultimately decided in May that he would sign up. And he flew over to Kiev and began his role as ambassador. What came next, he made pretty clear, is something like his worst nightmare.

[music]

nicholas fandos

And on Tuesday, he outlined that nightmare in a 15-page opening statement, which he read methodically over 40 minutes —

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

— to investigators gathered behind closed doors.

michael barbaro

And what does he say in this opening statement?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor begins a lot — like a lot of witnesses last week began. He describes two channels of foreign policy, an official channel and the kind of shadow or irregular channel, toward Ukraine. And he says basically, at first, these things are aligned. He told investigators, when I first arrived in Kiev in June and July, the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy served the same goal — a strong U.S.-Ukrainian partnership. But what he documents in copious notes and calls that he reconstructs and experiences that he has with other diplomats involved is a divergence of those two channels, a disintegration of the first one, essentially, in favor of the second. And he says, it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives.

michael barbaro

And what happened that led him to feel by August that there were two different sets of priorities here, that these things were no longer in line?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not long after Taylor arrives in Ukraine that it becomes increasingly clear to him that something funny is going on. At first, he hears from Ambassador Sondland that what the president really wants from the new Ukrainian leadership is a commitment to investigate his political opponents, the Bidens, and a conspiracy theory about Democratic and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and that to secure a visit to the White House, a visit that the Ukrainians badly want, will be contingent upon them publicly committing to conducting those investigations. As the summer goes on, he learns in July that, inexplicably and despite the guidance of the Defense Department and the State Department, the president has ordered the Office of Management and Budget to freeze the $400 million in security aid that is meant to be delivered to the Ukrainians. Taylor is completely alarmed by this. Remember, Taylor really knows the threat to Ukraine well, and he understands the power that this money has to help prop up its military. But what he doesn’t understand is why, at first, the money is being held up. And he describes, shortly after hearing that it’s going to be withheld, traveling to the northern border of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are coming into contact with mounting hostile Russian-led forces, and thinking to himself, “I know this aid is being withheld, and these guys don’t.” And this is the face of the threat. More Ukrainians are going to die if the United States assistance does not come through.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

And so he is really shaken by this and describes a series of meetings where he and others are trying to push to get it reinstated. And it’s around this time, Taylor testifies, he got on the phone with Sondland. And Sondland essentially said to him that everything, the White House meeting and the aid, were contingent upon the Ukrainians committing to these investigations. He said Sondland drew an analogy. He said, think of the president like a businessman. And when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that that person pay up before signing the check.” Now, Taylor is completely taken aback by this. In his view, the analogy doesn’t make any sense. Why would the Ukrainians owe President Trump anything?

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

The security systems had been allocated. And its delivery made sense not just for the Ukrainians, but for the United States’s strategic interest. So this is a kind of key seam that, to him, exposes that to President Trump and those who are enabling him in this effort, it’s not about America’s national security. It’s just about these investigations. And that is what the president is after. That’s the sole goal of his foreign policy here, of this second channel that broke off from the first and seems to be, at this point, more or less the one that matters to the White House.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Nick, how do you find out about all this testimony on Tuesday?

nicholas fandos

So Tuesday was another long day outside of the House Intelligence Committee SCIF. But it was a little unusual in that not long after the testimony began, Democrats began to come out —

archived recording (eric swalwell) I’m not going to comment on what he said inside there.

nicholas fandos

— and, without giving specifics, essentially say on the record —

archived recording (andy levin) In my 10 short months in Congress, this is the — my most disturbing day in Congress so far.

nicholas fandos

This is a pretty remarkable thing we’ve just heard.

archived recording (ted lieu) And his opening statement is devastating to Donald Trump.

nicholas fandos

This may be the most significant testimony yet.

archived recording (ted lieu) It was very damning for the president.

nicholas fandos

And they all walk out with copies of his 15-page opening statement in their hands, but none of them will give it up to the press. So you know, I basically spent hours running around, working the phones, trying to get my hands on this piece of paper. And only by the early afternoon was I able to get a copy and start reading it and making sense of it.

michael barbaro

And Nick, is a lot of what these Democrats are so excited about, outside this secure room where you’re waiting on Tuesday, is that now the money, the military aid, is back in the picture? It’s now showing up in these hearings after a week where it had not been present.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right. I mean, what they got with Bill Taylor today was somebody who had been there, had had a front seat to this whole story, come in and say, yeah, this thing in the middle, the military aid, the kind of — the worst possible thing in all of these allegations, that happened. That was true, and here’s why that matters. Democrats will tell you that any quid pro quo in this case is inappropriate. Even withholding a White House meeting is inappropriate and potentially impeachable from their point of view. But it’s the security aid, the withholding of a significant chunk of money that Republicans and Democrats both support, that they think is an obvious step for the United States to take for its own interests and to help its allies in Europe. That that would be withheld is, in political terms, kind of another magnitude of significance. And it’s the thing that Democrats think Republicans and, frankly, voters around the country are more likely to be convinced by. That hundreds of millions of dollars in hard military aid to fight a conflict against the Russians just resonates more with people. That’s a bigger kind of thing to be messing around with than a meeting at the White House, which most people don’t know why a meeting gets scheduled or doesn’t get scheduled. So by reinserting the military aid into the center of this, it reopens the possibility that this case could become more than a partisan exercise.

michael barbaro

But Nick, as you said, the whole impeachment inquiry began with a phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, in which military aid appeared to be withheld in exchange for these investigations that Trump wants. What’s different about what happened on Tuesday that makes it such a big deal?

nicholas fandos

So what we had before was an anonymous allegation from a whistle-blower whose information didn’t seem to be firsthand. And in any case, the public doesn’t know who that whistle-blower is. They can’t evaluate that person’s claims. What we had on Tuesday was the top American diplomat in Ukraine, the guy who was supposed to be managing the relationship between the two countries, coming forward and testifying on the record, before Congress, that he saw a quid pro quo, that he saw the aid being withheld to extract political gain for the president of the United States. And he offered an authoritative, detailed and vivid account of how that went down. And that goes a long way. It’s not the whole case, but it goes a long way in establishing for Democrats and for this investigation that what they suspected, what was initially alleged, did, in fact, occur.

michael barbaro

So at this point, what was first an anonymous allegation delivered by a whistle-blower was just very much confirmed by an ambassador under oath, like you just said. So what more evidence do people on the impeachment inquiry committees need, do you think, to vote to impeach the president?

nicholas fandos

So I think what they want is to continue moving towards these kind of inner concentric circles. So if they’ve talked to the ambassador now, next they want to hear from the White House budget office to hear what order exactly came down from President Trump to suspend the aid. What did that sound like? What did people in the office think? What debate happened there? They want to know what was happening in the National Security Council, where advisers and aides to the president were listening to a lot of these calls and interactions in real time, not to mention talking with him, and will have their own accounts as to what was going down. So basically, if Taylor has sketched in this important part of the picture, they’re looking for additional witnesses that are kind of even closer to the action to fill in kind of flourishes and details that will either back up or disprove what he had to say. Because ultimately, what this is really about is about President Trump. You’re not impeaching these other officials around him. The House would vote to impeach President Trump. And they need to be able to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt in the Senate. And so what they’re really after is as precise and vivid a picture as possible of what President Trump was doing and saying and meaning as he took these actions.

michael barbaro

Right. They want the closest thing possible to direct, irrefutable evidence that the president himself said, withhold this money until I get my investigation. And it sounds like on Tuesday, they got a lot closer to that, but perhaps not all the way.

nicholas fandos

That’s right, and that’s why the investigation will keep grinding on.

[music]

michael barbaro

Nick, thank you very much.

nicholas fandos

Glad to be with you again. Happy to do it.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

On Tuesday, Turkey and Russia announced that both countries would take joint control over northeast Syria, a major victory for Russia that expands its influence at the expense of the U.S. and Kurdish forces. The Times reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin has long wanted Russia to play a bigger role in the Middle East.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Before the career diplomats who deal with Ukraine discovered a shadowy power structure around President Trump that was determined to undermine and derail them, a little-known Trump cabinet secretary said that the same thing happened to him. A conversation with former Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin. It’s Thursday, October 24. Do you go by Secretary —

david shulkin

Secretary.

michael barbaro

— or Doctor?

david shulkin

Secretary.

michael barbaro

Secretary?

david shulkin

Yeah.

michael barbaro

O.K. So I want to start with the email that you sent me, because I think it was interesting. You describe yourself as somebody who was fired essentially by a tweet from the president, and that that came after an ordeal that you went through that involved political appointees essentially undermining you. And you call the experience strangely, unusually relevant these days, with the issue of interference by outside political influences, and you specifically mentioned what happened to Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. And you said we should perhaps talk about it on “The Daily.” So here you are.

david shulkin

Well, at the time, of course, this all seemed very unique to me. But as I’ve now been out of the Trump administration for almost 18 months, I have noticed a similarity in the behaviors and the patterns.

archived recording 1 There’s a lot of talk about how the State Department seems to be sidelined in this administration — archived recording 2 — the senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy, George Kent, told House Committee lawmakers Tuesday he was sidelined from his job — archived recording 3 — that William Taylor told congressional investigators there were, quote, “two channels” for policymaking on Ukraine, quote, “one regular and one highly irregular.” archived recording 4 Certainly here investigators want to know more about how Yovanovitch ultimately became benched in this entire thing, how she became sidelined.

michael barbaro

So I want to get to that and why you think what happened to you is similar, but I want to start with your story — your experience with the Trump administration. How is it that you came to be considered for a cabinet position by President Trump?

david shulkin

Well, I was in the Obama administration. I was a presidential appointee. I was the undersecretary of health for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I had come from the private sector, where I’d been running hospitals, and if I was given the opportunity to help, I didn’t feel like I could say no. So I spent 18 months in the Obama administration, and I was watching very closely about who the Trump administration would choose for its leadership positions in the V.A. But as a political appointee of the Obama administration, I was preparing to leave like everyone else. I had prepared my resignation letter for January 20th, and every day I would hear that there was a new person being speculated on as the secretary of V.A. And as time went on, we found ourselves into January, just a few weeks right before the inauguration, without any idea of who that secretary would be.

archived recording We begin with a Fox News alert. We’re awaiting the start of that news conference with President-elect Donald Trump. His first —

david shulkin

I happen to have heard that the president-elect on January 11th was going to be giving a press conference. Then as I was watching the teaser on one of the cable networks, the reporter at the very end said the President-elect may be announcing the new Secretary of V.A.

archived recording (donald trump) Thank you very much. It’s very —

david shulkin

And I thought, if I had time, because I had a very busy day, I’d like to watch that —

michael barbaro

See who he chooses?

david shulkin

Yeah.

archived recording (donald trump) — for the veterans. And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we’ll do a news release in a little while. I’ll tell you about David. He’s fantastic.

david shulkin

And I watched the press briefing to find out that he announced me as secretary.

michael barbaro

So you learn that you will be secretary of the V.A. by watching the news, and the breaking news on television is literally breaking news to you?

david shulkin

Yes.

michael barbaro

O.K., so you start this job already with a feeling that this is going to be unorthodox. So I’m curious, how does this experience begin, and when do you start to detect what you described at the beginning of our conversation and that email that you sent us as something resembling interference?

david shulkin

Well, I started to understand that I should stop thinking about this new administration the way that the Obama administration ran. The way the White House worked, from my perspective when I was in the Obama administration, it was a very tightly run ship. In the new administration, there was not a tight approach to how you navigated through the White House and had access to the president. It was pretty loose. So I’m the only member of the cabinet at this point who had been in their job, essentially, and in the administration prior, so I knew what needed to happen. I had a plan. So this looseness in the White House was something that I actually found very refreshing, and I was able to use, I think, to the advantage of the department and to veterans, in that, while others were just learning about their agencies, I knew what we needed to do. So the first large part of the year after the inauguration was a time of great productivity, but I think there were a couple events that started to make me question and wonder whether there was a dual path of decision-making in the White House. One event happened to be nationally televised.

archived recording (donald trump) I want to thank you all for being here.

david shulkin

We were sitting in the Roosevelt Room with the president next to me, and he turned to me, and he said —

archived recording (donald trump) We’re having a meeting tonight at what we call, affectionately, the “Southern White House.” Seems to be the most convenient location. Everybody always wants to go to the Southern White House.

david shulkin

— so, will I see you in Florida this weekend at the meeting on veterans policy and veterans issues?

archived recording (donald trump) So are you going to be at that meeting? You heard about it, right? It’s going to be great. All about the V.A.

david shulkin

And that was the first time I’d heard about it.

michael barbaro

Even though you are the secretary of Veterans Affairs?

david shulkin

Yes. And so I looked at him, and I smiled, because I thought it was somewhat humorous, and I just shook my head no. And I remember that time, because my daughter, Jenny, sent me a email saying that I was now a meme. And I didn’t know what a meme was, so I had to Google being a meme. And I quickly learned what a meme was, and saw that there was this meme of me shaking my head no. I had no idea what he was talking about.

michael barbaro

So the meme was of a cabinet secretary being out of the loop?

david shulkin

Yes, yes. But there clearly were these two paths of information about veterans issues — the ones that came directly for me, and the ones that were coming from other people.

michael barbaro

And what did you learn about who was providing this alternate path of information? Who are these people?

david shulkin

I think that there was a group of appointees — political appointees — in the Department of Veterans Affairs that would, on a regular basis, go over to the White House and have meetings on their own. The Department of Veterans Affairs gets about 30 of these political appointees. They are often appointed because of their political allegiance. They come off the campaign, or they’re found to be supportive of the administration, and they get placed in the department in key roles. So we had about 30 of them.

michael barbaro

O.K., so what do you understand about why there would be a parallel system? Like, what would be necessary about that? Why would anyone construct a second path of information to the president?

david shulkin

Well —

michael barbaro

I mean, they’ve got you.

david shulkin

Well, part of this is speculation, since they weren’t willing to surface these issues and policy disagreements with me, but I believe that there were two issues. One was that they didn’t feel that I was moving fast enough and aggressive enough to fix the department. And I think that that is a reasonable point of view. I was balancing what I believed the pace that the organization could handle change and also what veterans wanted. But secondly, there was a basic disagreement over how fast and how far I was willing to take resources from the V.A. and shift them to the private sector.

michael barbaro

And what did the background figures you’re describing here, what did they want when it comes to privatization?

david shulkin

Our biggest disagreement sounds technical, but it turns out to be very important. They’re called access standards, and the access standards are the rules in which veterans can choose to go outside of the V.A. health care system and get their care.

michael barbaro

To a private doctor that’s not in the V.A.?

david shulkin

To a private doctor that’s not in the V.A. And philosophically, I was in agreement that every veteran should have a choice about where they get their care, but I wanted to do this in a way that would not destroy the current V.A. system. Because my belief is that the V.A. is doing things that the private sector is not doing well, and therefore we needed to keep this a strong system and actually enhance its capabilities. But those that argued for open access standards immediately, my concern was we would see such an immediate shift in resources before the V.A. could be fixed that it would ultimately lead to a complete privatization of the department. The way I described it, it was like turning on a faucet. Rather than turning it on full thrust all of a sudden, I wanted to turn it on slowly and give the V.A. system and the private sector time to adapt to this type of philosophical change. So I believe that that was the issue that I fought hardest on and ultimately ended up costing me my job.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. How does this other faction respond to your resistance to the speed and the scale of what they’re pushing for, which is a much broader privatization plan than I think it sounds like you’re comfortable with?

david shulkin

Well, the legislative proposal with the approach that I believe is the right one gets presented to the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, which is a half-Republican, half-Democratic committee. And the vote is taken in the Senate committee — 14 in favor of the approach that I want to take, and one person, one senator, opposing it.

michael barbaro

Good sign for you.

david shulkin

I thought so. But the White House sided strongly with the one senator who wanted the much more aggressive access standards. And ultimately, the bill that got passed was the version that the one senator wanted.

michael barbaro

I guess I’m trying to understand — when you say the White House supported a different vision in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, what does that mean, the White House? Aren’t you part at the White House? You’re the secretary of the V.A., so what does that even mean?

david shulkin

It was a very confusing situation, because normally, the secretary speaks for the administration, and I was directly speaking to the president and had the president’s support. So this is where I became aware that there was a dual decision-making process even in the White House itself. What clearly was happening behind the scenes was that there was back-channel information being given to the president, ultimately to the point that he must have decided, with that information, that I actually wasn’t following policy that he wanted to happen. But that was a surprise to me.

michael barbaro

And that back-channel information, as best you can tell, who was it coming from?

david shulkin

I have no idea.

michael barbaro

So it feels like you’re now in this kind of upside-down world, where you are supposed to be the most powerful person in the V.A., you are now fighting your own administration over legislation, and people around you are kind of eager to circumvent you and cut you out of the process. But they are leaving you in place. You are very much the undisputed secretary of the V.A. So how or when does that start to change?

david shulkin

I think that this situation, where there was clearly a battle for who was going to be making the policy, got to the point that this group of political appointees felt that they wanted to see somebody else running the department, and out of frustration, I think, started to resort to ways to try to decrease the authority and the effectiveness that I had. And that’s where I believe that they perfected the art of the leak. In Washington, an allegation, even without fact, has a way of taking a life on its own. So there was information leaked about my travel, and there was misinformation that a trip to Europe was a inappropriate trip, where, in fact, what was not reported was that this trip to Europe was the Five Eyes conference, which were the five allies that have met for 45 years, attended by every secretary of the V.A. previously. And the allegation being that my wife was paid for to be able to attend this trip on a shopping vacation or a European vacation. In fact, the United Kingdom, who was the host of this event in London, had officially invited my wife, who is a physician, who attended these meetings and lectures. And a travel arrangement like this was months in the planning, where everything, especially my wife’s travel, was vetted by the V.A. ethics attorneys, by other staff members in the V.A., by the White House, by the State Department. We did not accept any per diems or any other funds associated with this, but there was an allegation that this was done inappropriately, when, in fact, I just relied upon the V.A., who makes my travel arrangements to do this. Now, when a secretary travels, there are two itineraries that are produced. There is a public itinerary about the public appearances, and then there is an itinerary that is prepared for security about every stop and every place that the secretary will be. Those are confidential. Those were leaked to the press, as well.

michael barbaro

So it sounds like you’re seeing leaks, in this case, of secure documents that only your internal staff would have access to, given to the press to suggest that you are crossing lines — that, for example, you and your family are cashing in on your position as secretary of the V.A., and this is a very intentional sabotaging of your status.

david shulkin

Yes, that’s right. And while I’m a scientist, I’m a physician, so I don’t like to jump to conclusions unless I have facts. And so while many people were telling me that I was being sabotaged, that people were working against me, I chose not to make a conclusion until I had facts. And then one day, my deputy secretary brings to me a email that his staff member found left on the copy machine. It is from the senior political appointee to other political appointees that says, here is the plan. We are going to work to replace the secretary.

michael barbaro

Wow.

david shulkin

We are going to replace the deputy secretary, because he’s not politically aligned with us — a lifelong Republican, by the way. We are going to replace the chief of staff, and we’re going to replace the acting undersecretary. And we’re going to put in place people that are politically aligned with us.

Who leaves that memo on the copy machine?

david shulkin

It was careless.

michael barbaro

But it was also very explicit and candid.

david shulkin

And now, as a scientist, I had my evidence. I actually now could see exactly what was going on.

michael barbaro

So I just want to be clear. Prior to all this, you very well understand that there are people talking behind your back about policy, going to the president, telling him, this is what should be done, that might differ from you. But now it’s advanced to a different place, where these people aren’t just happy talking around your back, they are trying to stab you in the back. They’re trying to get rid of you.

david shulkin

That’s correct.

michael barbaro

Did it ever occur to you, because you are secretary of the V.A., just to fire a bunch of these people who seem to be very much working to undermine you, because you are their boss?

david shulkin

It’s exactly what I did. I tried to remove them.

michael barbaro

And what happened?

david shulkin

They were told by the White House that they would not be removed, and I was told to stand down by the White House, that I could not remove them.

michael barbaro

Wow.

david shulkin

That emboldened them, knowing that they were protected.

michael barbaro

So tell me the story of how this all kind of came to a head.

david shulkin

Well, there had been lots of speculation about whether I would resign, or whether the president would replace me. I was talking to the president on a regular basis, and I was talking very specifically to General Kelly, who was chief of staff. And on the day that I was fired, I had heard a rumor that maybe I would be fired that day, so I called General Kelly and I said, look, here’s what I’m hearing. And he said, I don’t know anything about it. Let me check into it and call you back. And he called me back promptly, as he often did, and he said, David, I checked into it. There’s no truth to it. I spoke to the president. You have his confidence. Keep on doing what you’re doing. And then about noon that day, the president called me, and we had a discussion about what was happening at V.A. And I was able to tell him that we were working very hard and about to deliver three new policy objectives for him, and he was inquisitive about those policy objectives — a normal conversation — and said, keep going on doing what you’re doing, and let’s talk more about it tomorrow. And about five hours later —

archived recording Breaking news from the White House tonight. President Trump fired his secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin. President has tweeted, “I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronnie L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs,” which means the current Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin has now resigned. Why —

david shulkin

And that’s really the only and last time that I heard from the president.

michael barbaro

Was in a tweet?

david shulkin

Yes.

michael barbaro

So in the end, it sounds like you see yourself as a Trump appointee, very committed to the mission of your department, who was systematically undermined by political appointees who were really determined to push through their agenda and what they saw as the president’s agenda kind of at all costs. And that you became an obstacle. And that does sound kind of familiar in this moment. What do you see as the parallels to what has just happened when it comes to Ukraine? I assume you have been following it just as closely as we have.

david shulkin

Well, I think being a public servant focused on the mission of improving services to Americans, and then feeling that misinformation is being presented to the president by people who have other agendas that shortens your ability to serve, I think, is something that doesn’t work for the overall benefit of government. The parallels that I see are that there are outside people who ultimately end up having a big impact on the way the government runs, and I do think that what we’re seeing with the way that the president tends to get information from select individuals, that that really has a big influence on the way that decisions are being made. And it’s important that a president get the right information so they can make the right decisions. And my concern is that we may put policies in place that have consequences for decades to come.

michael barbaro

And finally, secretary, why is this story important for you to be telling? Not a lot of former secretaries in this administration — former generals, former national security advisers — talk about these experiences.

david shulkin

Yeah, I think it’s a duty to share what one’s learned in government, with the result of trying to make this better. I am not trying to throw mud at anybody or to make criticisms of any particular political party. I am trying to be transparent about what happened in my experience so that we can learn from it and make a government that works better for all of us.

michael barbaro

I mean, your book is called, “It Shouldn’t Be This Hard to Serve Your Country.”

david shulkin

That’s right. I am very concerned about the future of public service, and I’m concerned about the future for our veterans. And to have people who are willing to come from the private sector, like myself, and help in government and serve to be put through this type of situation in this type of environment, I think, is going to end up being a big problem for people wanting to come in the future. And so when I say it shouldn’t be this hard to serve your country, the scenario of being systematically undermined I don’t think is a good thing for us in terms of the way that we should be running this country.

michael barbaro

I wonder, can you confidently recommend, if someone comes to you, to serve in a position in the cabinet right now?

david shulkin

My hope is that people will continue to raise their hand to want to serve, but anybody who were to choose to go into this administration needs to understand that it’s likely not to end well, and that people have to be clear about the principles that they have and their belief system and make sure that they stick to that.

michael barbaro

Secretary, thank you very much.

david shulkin

Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

In a dramatic act of protest, House Republicans stormed into the secure offices where impeachment investigators have been hearing testimony behind closed doors and temporarily disrupted the proceedings. The Republicans, all allies of President Trump, demanded that the impeachment testimony be held in public. But because none of the Republicans are members of the committees conducting the hearings, they were eventually removed from the secure offices. And —

In a surprise move on Wednesday, President Trump said he would end the economic sanctions he imposed against Turkey for its deadly invasion of Syria just a week after creating them, saying that he trusted Turkey to abide by a ceasefire.

archived recording (donald trump) So the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we’re not happy with.

michael barbaro

But in a sign of bipartisan fury over Trump’s approach, Democratic and Republican senators challenged the president’s special envoy to Syria, James Jeffrey, about the original decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which allowed Turkey to kill hundreds of Kurds and for ISIS fighters to escape from prisons.

archived recording (bob menendez) And you know, Ambassador Jeffrey, I have the greatest respect for you. But one can try to put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig. One can ultimately call capitulation a victory, but it’s still capitulation. And one can ultimately have a retreat and say it’s strategic, but it’s still a retreat. And that’s, I feel, exactly what’s happened here.

He did so at the expense of longstanding foreign policy, a critical international alliance and the stability of the global order — and he used hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to do it.

The nation has known the basic outlines of this story for weeks, thanks to the bravery of a C.I.A. whistle-blower and others. But in 15 pages, Mr. Taylor laid out with a stunning degree of detail the extent of Mr. Trump’s effort to extort Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son over supposed corruption.

You know it’s bad for the president when the only response the White House can muster is to sidestep the testimony and complain instead about “a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.”

Would that be the same Constitution that Mr. Trump referred to, in part, as “phony” just this week ? Also, “radical unelected bureaucrat” is a curious way to describe Mr. Taylor, who currently serves as Mr. Trump’s acting envoy to Ukraine and is a retired career civil servant and Vietnam War veteran who has served under both Republican and Democratic presidents."

Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have become unexpected figures in the events at the heart of the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, having played a role in helping Mr. Giuliani’s efforts on behalf of President Trump to dig up information in Ukraine that could damage former Vice President Joseph R.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Before the career diplomats who deal with Ukraine discovered a shadowy power structure around President Trump that was determined to undermine and derail them, a little-known Trump cabinet secretary said that the same thing happened to him. A conversation with former Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin. It’s Thursday, October 24. Do you go by Secretary —

david shulkin

Secretary.

michael barbaro

— or Doctor?

david shulkin

Secretary.

michael barbaro

Secretary?

david shulkin

Yeah.

michael barbaro

O.K. So I want to start with the email that you sent me, because I think it was interesting. You describe yourself as somebody who was fired essentially by a tweet from the president, and that that came after an ordeal that you went through that involved political appointees essentially undermining you. And you call the experience strangely, unusually relevant these days, with the issue of interference by outside political influences, and you specifically mentioned what happened to Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. And you said we should perhaps talk about it on “The Daily.” So here you are.

david shulkin

Well, at the time, of course, this all seemed very unique to me. But as I’ve now been out of the Trump administration for almost 18 months, I have noticed a similarity in the behaviors and the patterns.

archived recording 1 There’s a lot of talk about how the State Department seems to be sidelined in this administration — archived recording 2 — the senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy, George Kent, told House Committee lawmakers Tuesday he was sidelined from his job — archived recording 3 — that William Taylor told congressional investigators there were, quote, “two channels” for policymaking on Ukraine, quote, “one regular and one highly irregular.” archived recording 4 Certainly here investigators want to know more about how Yovanovitch ultimately became benched in this entire thing, how she became sidelined.

michael barbaro

So I want to get to that and why you think what happened to you is similar, but I want to start with your story — your experience with the Trump administration. How is it that you came to be considered for a cabinet position by President Trump?

david shulkin

Well, I was in the Obama administration. I was a presidential appointee. I was the undersecretary of health for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I had come from the private sector, where I’d been running hospitals, and if I was given the opportunity to help, I didn’t feel like I could say no. So I spent 18 months in the Obama administration, and I was watching very closely about who the Trump administration would choose for its leadership positions in the V.A. But as a political appointee of the Obama administration, I was preparing to leave like everyone else. I had prepared my resignation letter for January 20th, and every day I would hear that there was a new person being speculated on as the secretary of V.A. And as time went on, we found ourselves into January, just a few weeks right before the inauguration, without any idea of who that secretary would be.

archived recording We begin with a Fox News alert. We’re awaiting the start of that news conference with President-elect Donald Trump. His first —

david shulkin

I happen to have heard that the president-elect on January 11th was going to be giving a press conference. Then as I was watching the teaser on one of the cable networks, the reporter at the very end said the President-elect may be announcing the new Secretary of V.A.

archived recording (donald trump) Thank you very much. It’s very —

david shulkin

And I thought, if I had time, because I had a very busy day, I’d like to watch that —

michael barbaro

See who he chooses?

david shulkin

Yeah.

archived recording (donald trump) — for the veterans. And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we’ll do a news release in a little while. I’ll tell you about David. He’s fantastic.

david shulkin

And I watched the press briefing to find out that he announced me as secretary.

michael barbaro

So you learn that you will be secretary of the V.A. by watching the news, and the breaking news on television is literally breaking news to you?

david shulkin

Yes.

michael barbaro

O.K., so you start this job already with a feeling that this is going to be unorthodox. So I’m curious, how does this experience begin, and when do you start to detect what you described at the beginning of our conversation and that email that you sent us as something resembling interference?

david shulkin

Well, I started to understand that I should stop thinking about this new administration the way that the Obama administration ran. The way the White House worked, from my perspective when I was in the Obama administration, it was a very tightly run ship. In the new administration, there was not a tight approach to how you navigated through the White House and had access to the president. It was pretty loose. So I’m the only member of the cabinet at this point who had been in their job, essentially, and in the administration prior, so I knew what needed to happen. I had a plan. So this looseness in the White House was something that I actually found very refreshing, and I was able to use, I think, to the advantage of the department and to veterans, in that, while others were just learning about their agencies, I knew what we needed to do. So the first large part of the year after the inauguration was a time of great productivity, but I think there were a couple events that started to make me question and wonder whether there was a dual path of decision-making in the White House. One event happened to be nationally televised.

archived recording (donald trump) I want to thank you all for being here.

david shulkin

We were sitting in the Roosevelt Room with the president next to me, and he turned to me, and he said —

archived recording (donald trump) We’re having a meeting tonight at what we call, affectionately, the “Southern White House.” Seems to be the most convenient location. Everybody always wants to go to the Southern White House.

david shulkin

— so, will I see you in Florida this weekend at the meeting on veterans policy and veterans issues?

archived recording (donald trump) So are you going to be at that meeting? You heard about it, right? It’s going to be great. All about the V.A.

david shulkin

And that was the first time I’d heard about it.

michael barbaro

Even though you are the secretary of Veterans Affairs?

david shulkin

Yes. And so I looked at him, and I smiled, because I thought it was somewhat humorous, and I just shook my head no. And I remember that time, because my daughter, Jenny, sent me a email saying that I was now a meme. And I didn’t know what a meme was, so I had to Google being a meme. And I quickly learned what a meme was, and saw that there was this meme of me shaking my head no. I had no idea what he was talking about.

michael barbaro

So the meme was of a cabinet secretary being out of the loop?

david shulkin

Yes, yes. But there clearly were these two paths of information about veterans issues — the ones that came directly for me, and the ones that were coming from other people.

michael barbaro

And what did you learn about who was providing this alternate path of information? Who are these people?

david shulkin

I think that there was a group of appointees — political appointees — in the Department of Veterans Affairs that would, on a regular basis, go over to the White House and have meetings on their own. The Department of Veterans Affairs gets about 30 of these political appointees. They are often appointed because of their political allegiance. They come off the campaign, or they’re found to be supportive of the administration, and they get placed in the department in key roles. So we had about 30 of them.

michael barbaro

O.K., so what do you understand about why there would be a parallel system? Like, what would be necessary about that? Why would anyone construct a second path of information to the president?

david shulkin

Well —

michael barbaro

I mean, they’ve got you.

david shulkin

Well, part of this is speculation, since they weren’t willing to surface these issues and policy disagreements with me, but I believe that there were two issues. One was that they didn’t feel that I was moving fast enough and aggressive enough to fix the department. And I think that that is a reasonable point of view. I was balancing what I believed the pace that the organization could handle change and also what veterans wanted. But secondly, there was a basic disagreement over how fast and how far I was willing to take resources from the V.A. and shift them to the private sector.

michael barbaro

And what did the background figures you’re describing here, what did they want when it comes to privatization?

david shulkin

Our biggest disagreement sounds technical, but it turns out to be very important. They’re called access standards, and the access standards are the rules in which veterans can choose to go outside of the V.A. health care system and get their care.

michael barbaro

To a private doctor that’s not in the V.A.?

david shulkin

To a private doctor that’s not in the V.A. And philosophically, I was in agreement that every veteran should have a choice about where they get their care, but I wanted to do this in a way that would not destroy the current V.A. system. Because my belief is that the V.A. is doing things that the private sector is not doing well, and therefore we needed to keep this a strong system and actually enhance its capabilities. But those that argued for open access standards immediately, my concern was we would see such an immediate shift in resources before the V.A. could be fixed that it would ultimately lead to a complete privatization of the department. The way I described it, it was like turning on a faucet. Rather than turning it on full thrust all of a sudden, I wanted to turn it on slowly and give the V.A. system and the private sector time to adapt to this type of philosophical change. So I believe that that was the issue that I fought hardest on and ultimately ended up costing me my job.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. How does this other faction respond to your resistance to the speed and the scale of what they’re pushing for, which is a much broader privatization plan than I think it sounds like you’re comfortable with?

david shulkin

Well, the legislative proposal with the approach that I believe is the right one gets presented to the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, which is a half-Republican, half-Democratic committee. And the vote is taken in the Senate committee — 14 in favor of the approach that I want to take, and one person, one senator, opposing it.

michael barbaro

Good sign for you.

david shulkin

I thought so. But the White House sided strongly with the one senator who wanted the much more aggressive access standards. And ultimately, the bill that got passed was the version that the one senator wanted.

michael barbaro

I guess I’m trying to understand — when you say the White House supported a different vision in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, what does that mean, the White House? Aren’t you part at the White House? You’re the secretary of the V.A., so what does that even mean?

david shulkin

It was a very confusing situation, because normally, the secretary speaks for the administration, and I was directly speaking to the president and had the president’s support. So this is where I became aware that there was a dual decision-making process even in the White House itself. What clearly was happening behind the scenes was that there was back-channel information being given to the president, ultimately to the point that he must have decided, with that information, that I actually wasn’t following policy that he wanted to happen. But that was a surprise to me.

michael barbaro

And that back-channel information, as best you can tell, who was it coming from?

david shulkin

I have no idea.

michael barbaro

So it feels like you’re now in this kind of upside-down world, where you are supposed to be the most powerful person in the V.A., you are now fighting your own administration over legislation, and people around you are kind of eager to circumvent you and cut you out of the process. But they are leaving you in place. You are very much the undisputed secretary of the V.A. So how or when does that start to change?

david shulkin

I think that this situation, where there was clearly a battle for who was going to be making the policy, got to the point that this group of political appointees felt that they wanted to see somebody else running the department, and out of frustration, I think, started to resort to ways to try to decrease the authority and the effectiveness that I had. And that’s where I believe that they perfected the art of the leak. In Washington, an allegation, even without fact, has a way of taking a life on its own. So there was information leaked about my travel, and there was misinformation that a trip to Europe was a inappropriate trip, where, in fact, what was not reported was that this trip to Europe was the Five Eyes conference, which were the five allies that have met for 45 years, attended by every secretary of the V.A. previously. And the allegation being that my wife was paid for to be able to attend this trip on a shopping vacation or a European vacation. In fact, the United Kingdom, who was the host of this event in London, had officially invited my wife, who is a physician, who attended these meetings and lectures. And a travel arrangement like this was months in the planning, where everything, especially my wife’s travel, was vetted by the V.A. ethics attorneys, by other staff members in the V.A., by the White House, by the State Department. We did not accept any per diems or any other funds associated with this, but there was an allegation that this was done inappropriately, when, in fact, I just relied upon the V.A., who makes my travel arrangements to do this. Now, when a secretary travels, there are two itineraries that are produced. There is a public itinerary about the public appearances, and then there is an itinerary that is prepared for security about every stop and every place that the secretary will be. Those are confidential. Those were leaked to the press, as well.

michael barbaro

So it sounds like you’re seeing leaks, in this case, of secure documents that only your internal staff would have access to, given to the press to suggest that you are crossing lines — that, for example, you and your family are cashing in on your position as secretary of the V.A., and this is a very intentional sabotaging of your status.

david shulkin

Yes, that’s right. And while I’m a scientist, I’m a physician, so I don’t like to jump to conclusions unless I have facts. And so while many people were telling me that I was being sabotaged, that people were working against me, I chose not to make a conclusion until I had facts. And then one day, my deputy secretary brings to me a email that his staff member found left on the copy machine. It is from the senior political appointee to other political appointees that says, here is the plan. We are going to work to replace the secretary.

michael barbaro

Wow.

david shulkin

We are going to replace the deputy secretary, because he’s not politically aligned with us — a lifelong Republican, by the way. We are going to replace the chief of staff, and we’re going to replace the acting undersecretary. And we’re going to put in place people that are politically aligned with us.

michael barbaro

Who leaves that memo on the copy machine?

david shulkin

It was careless.

michael barbaro

But it was also very explicit and candid.

david shulkin

And now, as a scientist, I had my evidence. I actually now could see exactly what was going on.

michael barbaro

So I just want to be clear. Prior to all this, you very well understand that there are people talking behind your back about policy, going to the president, telling him, this is what should be done, that might differ from you. But now it’s advanced to a different place, where these people aren’t just happy talking around your back, they are trying to stab you in the back. They’re trying to get rid of you.

david shulkin

That’s correct.

michael barbaro

Did it ever occur to you, because you are secretary of the V.A., just to fire a bunch of these people who seem to be very much working to undermine you, because you are their boss?

david shulkin

It’s exactly what I did. I tried to remove them.

michael barbaro

And what happened?

david shulkin

They were told by the White House that they would not be removed, and I was told to stand down by the White House, that I could not remove them.

michael barbaro

Wow.

david shulkin

That emboldened them, knowing that they were protected.

michael barbaro

So tell me the story of how this all kind of came to a head.

david shulkin

Well, there had been lots of speculation about whether I would resign, or whether the president would replace me. I was talking to the president on a regular basis, and I was talking very specifically to General Kelly, who was chief of staff. And on the day that I was fired, I had heard a rumor that maybe I would be fired that day, so I called General Kelly and I said, look, here’s what I’m hearing. And he said, I don’t know anything about it. Let me check into it and call you back. And he called me back promptly, as he often did, and he said, David, I checked into it. There’s no truth to it. I spoke to the president. You have his confidence. Keep on doing what you’re doing. And then about noon that day, the president called me, and we had a discussion about what was happening at V.A. And I was able to tell him that we were working very hard and about to deliver three new policy objectives for him, and he was inquisitive about those policy objectives — a normal conversation — and said, keep going on doing what you’re doing, and let’s talk more about it tomorrow. And about five hours later —

archived recording Breaking news from the White House tonight. President Trump fired his secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin. President has tweeted, “I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronnie L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs,” which means the current Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin has now resigned. Why —

david shulkin

And that’s really the only and last time that I heard from the president.

michael barbaro

Was in a tweet?

david shulkin

Yes.

michael barbaro

So in the end, it sounds like you see yourself as a Trump appointee, very committed to the mission of your department, who was systematically undermined by political appointees who were really determined to push through their agenda and what they saw as the president’s agenda kind of at all costs. And that you became an obstacle. And that does sound kind of familiar in this moment. What do you see as the parallels to what has just happened when it comes to Ukraine? I assume you have been following it just as closely as we have.

david shulkin

Well, I think being a public servant focused on the mission of improving services to Americans, and then feeling that misinformation is being presented to the president by people who have other agendas that shortens your ability to serve, I think, is something that doesn’t work for the overall benefit of government. The parallels that I see are that there are outside people who ultimately end up having a big impact on the way the government runs, and I do think that what we’re seeing with the way that the president tends to get information from select individuals, that that really has a big influence on the way that decisions are being made. And it’s important that a president get the right information so they can make the right decisions. And my concern is that we may put policies in place that have consequences for decades to come.

michael barbaro

And finally, secretary, why is this story important for you to be telling? Not a lot of former secretaries in this administration — former generals, former national security advisers — talk about these experiences.

david shulkin

Yeah, I think it’s a duty to share what one’s learned in government, with the result of trying to make this better. I am not trying to throw mud at anybody or to make criticisms of any particular political party. I am trying to be transparent about what happened in my experience so that we can learn from it and make a government that works better for all of us.

michael barbaro

I mean, your book is called, “It Shouldn’t Be This Hard to Serve Your Country.”

david shulkin

That’s right. I am very concerned about the future of public service, and I’m concerned about the future for our veterans. And to have people who are willing to come from the private sector, like myself, and help in government and serve to be put through this type of situation in this type of environment, I think, is going to end up being a big problem for people wanting to come in the future. And so when I say it shouldn’t be this hard to serve your country, the scenario of being systematically undermined I don’t think is a good thing for us in terms of the way that we should be running this country.

michael barbaro

I wonder, can you confidently recommend, if someone comes to you, to serve in a position in the cabinet right now?

david shulkin

My hope is that people will continue to raise their hand to want to serve, but anybody who were to choose to go into this administration needs to understand that it’s likely not to end well, and that people have to be clear about the principles that they have and their belief system and make sure that they stick to that.

michael barbaro

Secretary, thank you very much.

david shulkin

Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

In a dramatic act of protest, House Republicans stormed into the secure offices where impeachment investigators have been hearing testimony behind closed doors and temporarily disrupted the proceedings. The Republicans, all allies of President Trump, demanded that the impeachment testimony be held in public. But because none of the Republicans are members of the committees conducting the hearings, they were eventually removed from the secure offices. And —

nicholas fandos

[LAUGHS]

[music]

michael barbaro

Nick Fandos covers Congress for The Times. Nick, where did we leave off with you last week?

nicholas fandos

So remember, last week we heard testimony from a string of American diplomats, both career diplomats and political appointees working for Donald Trump. And what they describe day after day in testimony was, essentially, the traditional American foreign policy apparatus getting sidelined or pushed aside by President Trump, his personal lawyer, and a cadre of political appointees who were close around him and were setting the agenda for the country’s policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Right. And the names that kept coming up again and again were Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland?

nicholas fandos

That’s right. And by Thursday, we heard from Sondland himself, who you’ll remember is the ambassador to the European Union. He’s a former Trump political donor. Sondland, after witness after witness this week had placed him at the center of this shadow foreign policy, if you will, came in and essentially said, hey, I know there’s all this attention on me, but I was merely following the directions of President Trump.

michael barbaro

And Nick, what did we hear in this testimony about what the point of this shadow structure was? Why have it? What are they up to?

nicholas fandos

So a lot of this testimony revolved around a meeting that the Ukrainians wanted to have with President Trump at the White House that they believed would lend credibility to the new administration in that country. And the questions that came up again and again were, was there a quid pro quo that the Trump administration was trying to extract investigations from the Ukrainians into the president’s political rivals in exchange for that meeting? That they were holding out that meeting and saying, we’ll only give you this if we get what we want. But what’s interesting is what they weren’t testifying about. For the most part, there was very little discussion last week of the military aid that President Trump had ordered to be frozen this summer. This is almost $400 million in security funds that Congress allocated in a bipartisan fashion for Ukraine. And there have been allegations, first from the whistle-blower that initiated this case and throughout, that that aid may have been frozen as a leverage point as well, as another kind of quid pro quo to extract these politically advantageous investigations. But we weren’t hearing a whole lot about that as the week wore on.

michael barbaro

Right. There were two allegations of a quid pro quo. There was the White House visit in exchange for these investigations, and then there was this $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. And my sense is that the allegation that the military aid had been held up in this scheme was by far the more explosive of the two.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Remember, when House Democrats launched this impeachment inquiry a little bit more than a month ago, it was the prospect of $400 million in bipartisan approved military aid that had most alarmed lawmakers in both parties. It’s that military aid that got moderate Democrats, the ones from swing districts that President Trump won in 2016 who are kind of teetering on the edge as they face re-election, to come on board and say, yes, we do support an inquiry. They threw crucial support behind this investigation explicitly because it was tied to national security.

michael barbaro

Right. And what did you make of the fact that the money, which had been the source of so much focus, wasn’t really coming up? Did that at all cause you to wonder, as I will admit it did for me, if the military aid aspect of the story maybe just wasn’t there? If it hadn’t maybe been something that the president was holding over Ukraine to get these investigations he wanted into the Democrats?

nicholas fandos

I think that that certainly began to feel like more of a possibility. The Trump administration has given publicly other reasons for withholding this aid. And in some respects, it makes sense that they would have withheld it when they were looking to cut down on the expensive foreign aid all over the country. So —

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

— I wouldn’t have been altogether surprised if that part of the story continued to shrink away. At the same time, so much of what the original whistle-blower — who has brought this case to the fore, who helped launch this impeachment inquiry indirectly — has alleged has borne out to date, that I don’t think we could fully rule out the idea that the aid had been held up as leverage for these investigations. And so it just remained a kind of open, tantalizing question, will this bear out or won’t it? And that’s where we pick things up this week.

michael barbaro

O.K., so get us up to speed about what actually happened on Tuesday.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday morning, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine right now, arrived on Capitol Hill for his own deposition with House impeachment investigators.

michael barbaro

And what we need to know about Bill Taylor besides that?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor is another one of these career national security officials who has served Democrats and Republicans. He’s been serving the country, he told investigators today, for 50 years, starting as a cadet at West Point, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem. During George W. Bush’s administration, he was an ambassador to Ukraine. And he had actually retired when the State Department contacted him early this year, after Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, was ousted by President Trump, and asked him if he’d be willing to come back to take control of the American mission in Ukraine and help to implement the president’s policies. And he began explaining to investigators today that he knew, in a sense, what he was getting into, and he had real pause as he looked toward taking this job. He sought assurances from the State Department, essentially, that he would be able to exercise policy as he saw fit and that he wasn’t going to be a victim of the same kind of political games that she was. With those assurances, he ultimately decided in May that he would sign up. And he flew over to Kiev and began his role as ambassador. What came next, he made pretty clear, is something like his worst nightmare.

[music]

nicholas fandos

And on Tuesday, he outlined that nightmare in a 15-page opening statement, which he read methodically over 40 minutes —

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

— to investigators gathered behind closed doors.

michael barbaro

And what does he say in this opening statement?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor begins a lot — like a lot of witnesses last week began. He describes two channels of foreign policy, an official channel and the kind of shadow or irregular channel, toward Ukraine. And he says basically, at first, these things are aligned. He told investigators, when I first arrived in Kiev in June and July, the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy served the same goal — a strong U.S.-Ukrainian partnership. But what he documents in copious notes and calls that he reconstructs and experiences that he has with other diplomats involved is a divergence of those two channels, a disintegration of the first one, essentially, in favor of the second. And he says, it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives.

michael barbaro

And what happened that led him to feel by August that there were two different sets of priorities here, that these things were no longer in line?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not long after Taylor arrives in Ukraine that it becomes increasingly clear to him that something funny is going on. At first, he hears from Ambassador Sondland that what the president really wants from the new Ukrainian leadership is a commitment to investigate his political opponents, the Bidens, and a conspiracy theory about Democratic and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and that to secure a visit to the White House, a visit that the Ukrainians badly want, will be contingent upon them publicly committing to conducting those investigations. As the summer goes on, he learns in July that, inexplicably and despite the guidance of the Defense Department and the State Department, the president has ordered the Office of Management and Budget to freeze the $400 million in security aid that is meant to be delivered to the Ukrainians. Taylor is completely alarmed by this. Remember, Taylor really knows the threat to Ukraine well, and he understands the power that this money has to help prop up its military. But what he doesn’t understand is why, at first, the money is being held up. And he describes, shortly after hearing that it’s going to be withheld, traveling to the northern border of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are coming into contact with mounting hostile Russian-led forces, and thinking to himself, “I know this aid is being withheld, and these guys don’t.” And this is the face of the threat. More Ukrainians are going to die if the United States assistance does not come through.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

And so he is really shaken by this and describes a series of meetings where he and others are trying to push to get it reinstated. And it’s around this time, Taylor testifies, he got on the phone with Sondland. And Sondland essentially said to him that everything, the White House meeting and the aid, were contingent upon the Ukrainians committing to these investigations. He said Sondland drew an analogy. He said, think of the president like a businessman. And when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that that person pay up before signing the check.” Now, Taylor is completely taken aback by this. In his view, the analogy doesn’t make any sense. Why would the Ukrainians owe President Trump anything?

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

The security systems had been allocated. And its delivery made sense not just for the Ukrainians, but for the United States’s strategic interest. So this is a kind of key seam that, to him, exposes that to President Trump and those who are enabling him in this effort, it’s not about America’s national security. It’s just about these investigations. And that is what the president is after. That’s the sole goal of his foreign policy here, of this second channel that broke off from the first and seems to be, at this point, more or less the one that matters to the White House.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Nick, how do you find out about all this testimony on Tuesday?

nicholas fandos

So Tuesday was another long day outside of the House Intelligence Committee SCIF. But it was a little unusual in that not long after the testimony began, Democrats began to come out —

archived recording (eric swalwell) I’m not going to comment on what he said inside there.

nicholas fandos

— and, without giving specifics, essentially say on the record —

archived recording (andy levin) In my 10 short months in Congress, this is the — my most disturbing day in Congress so far.

nicholas fandos

This is a pretty remarkable thing we’ve just heard.

archived recording (ted lieu) And his opening statement is devastating to Donald Trump.

nicholas fandos

This may be the most significant testimony yet.

archived recording (ted lieu) It was very damning for the president.

nicholas fandos

And they all walk out with copies of his 15-page opening statement in their hands, but none of them will give it up to the press. So you know, I basically spent hours running around, working the phones, trying to get my hands on this piece of paper. And only by the early afternoon was I able to get a copy and start reading it and making sense of it.

michael barbaro

And Nick, is a lot of what these Democrats are so excited about, outside this secure room where you’re waiting on Tuesday, is that now the money, the military aid, is back in the picture? It’s now showing up in these hearings after a week where it had not been present.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right. I mean, what they got with Bill Taylor today was somebody who had been there, had had a front seat to this whole story, come in and say, yeah, this thing in the middle, the military aid, the kind of — the worst possible thing in all of these allegations, that happened. That was true, and here’s why that matters. Democrats will tell you that any quid pro quo in this case is inappropriate. Even withholding a White House meeting is inappropriate and potentially impeachable from their point of view. But it’s the security aid, the withholding of a significant chunk of money that Republicans and Democrats both support, that they think is an obvious step for the United States to take for its own interests and to help its allies in Europe. That that would be withheld is, in political terms, kind of another magnitude of significance. And it’s the thing that Democrats think Republicans and, frankly, voters around the country are more likely to be convinced by. That hundreds of millions of dollars in hard military aid to fight a conflict against the Russians just resonates more with people. That’s a bigger kind of thing to be messing around with than a meeting at the White House, which most people don’t know why a meeting gets scheduled or doesn’t get scheduled. So by reinserting the military aid into the center of this, it reopens the possibility that this case could become more than a partisan exercise.

michael barbaro

But Nick, as you said, the whole impeachment inquiry began with a phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, in which military aid appeared to be withheld in exchange for these investigations that Trump wants. What’s different about what happened on Tuesday that makes it such a big deal?

nicholas fandos

So what we had before was an anonymous allegation from a whistle-blower whose information didn’t seem to be firsthand. And in any case, the public doesn’t know who that whistle-blower is. They can’t evaluate that person’s claims. What we had on Tuesday was the top American diplomat in Ukraine, the guy who was supposed to be managing the relationship between the two countries, coming forward and testifying on the record, before Congress, that he saw a quid pro quo, that he saw the aid being withheld to extract political gain for the president of the United States. And he offered an authoritative, detailed and vivid account of how that went down. And that goes a long way. It’s not the whole case, but it goes a long way in establishing for Democrats and for this investigation that what they suspected, what was initially alleged, did, in fact, occur.

michael barbaro

So at this point, what was first an anonymous allegation delivered by a whistle-blower was just very much confirmed by an ambassador under oath, like you just said. So what more evidence do people on the impeachment inquiry committees need, do you think, to vote to impeach the president?

nicholas fandos

So I think what they want is to continue moving towards these kind of inner concentric circles. So if they’ve talked to the ambassador now, next they want to hear from the White House budget office to hear what order exactly came down from President Trump to suspend the aid. What did that sound like? What did people in the office think? What debate happened there? They want to know what was happening in the National Security Council, where advisers and aides to the president were listening to a lot of these calls and interactions in real time, not to mention talking with him, and will have their own accounts as to what was going down. So basically, if Taylor has sketched in this important part of the picture, they’re looking for additional witnesses that are kind of even closer to the action to fill in kind of flourishes and details that will either back up or disprove what he had to say. Because ultimately, what this is really about is about President Trump. You’re not impeaching these other officials around him. The House would vote to impeach President Trump. And they need to be able to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt in the Senate. And so what they’re really after is as precise and vivid a picture as possible of what President Trump was doing and saying and meaning as he took these actions.

michael barbaro

Right. They want the closest thing possible to direct, irrefutable evidence that the president himself said, withhold this money until I get my investigation. And it sounds like on Tuesday, they got a lot closer to that, but perhaps not all the way.

nicholas fandos

That’s right, and that’s why the investigation will keep grinding on.

He’s been serving the country, he told investigators today, for 50 years, starting as a cadet at West Point, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem. During George W. Bush’s administration, he was an ambassador to Ukraine. And he had actually retired when the State Department contacted him early this year, after Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, was ousted by President Trump, and asked him if he’d be willing to come back to take control of the American mission in Ukraine and help to implement the president’s policies. And he began explaining to investigators today that he knew, in a sense, what he was getting into, and he had real pause as he looked toward taking this job. He sought assurances from the State Department, essentially, that he would be able to exercise policy as he saw fit and that he wasn’t going to be a victim of the same kind of political games that she was. With those assurances, he ultimately decided in May that he would sign up. And he flew over to Kiev and began his role as ambassador. What came next, he made pretty clear, is something like his worst nightmare.

nicholas fandos

And on Tuesday, he outlined that nightmare in a 15-page opening statement, which he read methodically over 40 minutes —

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

— to investigators gathered behind closed doors.

michael barbaro

And what does he say in this opening statement?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor begins a lot — like a lot of witnesses last week began. He describes two channels of foreign policy, an official channel and the kind of shadow or irregular channel, toward Ukraine. And he says basically, at first, these things are aligned. He told investigators, when I first arrived in Kiev in June and July, the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy served the same goal — a strong U.S.-Ukrainian partnership. But what he documents in copious notes and calls that he reconstructs and experiences that he has with other diplomats involved is a divergence of those two channels, a disintegration of the first one, essentially, in favor of the second. And he says, it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives.

michael barbaro

And what happened that led him to feel by August that there were two different sets of priorities here, that these things were no longer in line?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not long after Taylor arrives in Ukraine that it becomes increasingly clear to him that something funny is going on. At first, he hears from Ambassador Sondland that what the president really wants from the new Ukrainian leadership is a commitment to investigate his political opponents, the Bidens, and a conspiracy theory about Democratic and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and that to secure a visit to the White House, a visit that the Ukrainians badly want, will be contingent upon them publicly committing to conducting those investigations. As the summer goes on, he learns in July that, inexplicably and despite the guidance of the Defense Department and the State Department, the president has ordered the Office of Management and Budget to freeze the $400 million in security aid that is meant to be delivered to the Ukrainians. Taylor is completely alarmed by this. Remember, Taylor really knows the threat to Ukraine well, and he understands the power that this money has to help prop up its military. But what he doesn’t understand is why, at first, the money is being held up. And he describes, shortly after hearing that it’s going to be withheld, traveling to the northern border of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are coming into contact with mounting hostile Russian-led forces, and thinking to himself, “I know this aid is being withheld, and these guys don’t.” And this is the face of the threat. More Ukrainians are going to die if the United States assistance does not come through.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

And so he is really shaken by this and describes a series of meetings where he and others are trying to push to get it reinstated. And it’s around this time, Taylor testifies, he got on the phone with Sondland. And Sondland essentially said to him that everything, the White House meeting and the aid, were contingent upon the Ukrainians committing to these investigations. He said Sondland drew an analogy. He said, think of the president like a businessman. And when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that that person pay up before signing the check.” Now, Taylor is completely taken aback by this. In his view, the analogy doesn’t make any sense. Why would the Ukrainians owe President Trump anything?

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

The security systems had been allocated. And its delivery made sense not just for the Ukrainians, but for the United States’s strategic interest. So this is a kind of key seam that, to him, exposes that to President Trump and those who are enabling him in this effort, it’s not about America’s national security. It’s just about these investigations. And that is what the president is after. That’s the sole goal of his foreign policy here, of this second channel that broke off from the first and seems to be, at this point, more or less the one that matters to the White House.

We’ll be right back. So Nick, how do you find out about all this testimony on Tuesday?

nicholas fandos

So Tuesday was another long day outside of the House Intelligence Committee SCIF. But it was a little unusual in that not long after the testimony began, Democrats began to come out —

archived recording (eric swalwell) I’m not going to comment on what he said inside there.

nicholas fandos

— and, without giving specifics, essentially say on the record —

archived recording (andy levin) In my 10 short months in Congress, this is the — my most disturbing day in Congress so far.

nicholas fandos

This is a pretty remarkable thing we’ve just heard.

archived recording (ted lieu) And his opening statement is devastating to Donald Trump.

nicholas fandos

This may be the most significant testimony yet.

archived recording (ted lieu) It was very damning for the president.

nicholas fandos

And they all walk out with copies of his 15-page opening statement in their hands, but none of them will give it up to the press. So you know, I basically spent hours running around, working the phones, trying to get my hands on this piece of paper. And only by the early afternoon was I able to get a copy and start reading it and making sense of it.

michael barbaro

And Nick, is a lot of what these Democrats are so excited about, outside this secure room where you’re waiting on Tuesday, is that now the money, the military aid, is back in the picture? It’s now showing up in these hearings after a week where it had not been present.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right. I mean, what they got with Bill Taylor today was somebody who had been there, had had a front seat to this whole story, come in and say, yeah, this thing in the middle, the military aid, the kind of — the worst possible thing in all of these allegations, that happened. That was true, and here’s why that matters. Democrats will tell you that any quid pro quo in this case is inappropriate. Even withholding a White House meeting is inappropriate and potentially impeachable from their point of view. But it’s the security aid, the withholding of a significant chunk of money that Republicans and Democrats both support, that they think is an obvious step for the United States to take for its own interests and to help its allies in Europe. That that would be withheld is, in political terms, kind of another magnitude of significance. And it’s the thing that Democrats think Republicans and, frankly, voters around the country are more likely to be convinced by. That hundreds of millions of dollars in hard military aid to fight a conflict against the Russians just resonates more with people. That’s a bigger kind of thing to be messing around with than a meeting at the White House, which most people don’t know why a meeting gets scheduled or doesn’t get scheduled. So by reinserting the military aid into the center of this, it reopens the possibility that this case could become more than a partisan exercise.

michael barbaro

But Nick, as you said, the whole impeachment inquiry began with a phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, in which military aid appeared to be withheld in exchange for these investigations that Trump wants. What’s different about what happened on Tuesday that makes it such a big deal?

nicholas fandos

So what we had before was an anonymous allegation from a whistle-blower whose information didn’t seem to be firsthand. And in any case, the public doesn’t know who that whistle-blower is. They can’t evaluate that person’s claims. What we had on Tuesday was the top American diplomat in Ukraine, the guy who was supposed to be managing the relationship between the two countries, coming forward and testifying on the record, before Congress, that he saw a quid pro quo, that he saw the aid being withheld to extract political gain for the president of the United States. And he offered an authoritative, detailed and vivid account of how that went down. And that goes a long way. It’s not the whole case, but it goes a long way in establishing for Democrats and for this investigation that what they suspected, what was initially alleged, did, in fact, occur.

michael barbaro

So at this point, what was first an anonymous allegation delivered by a whistle-blower was just very much confirmed by an ambassador under oath, like you just said. So what more evidence do people on the impeachment inquiry committees need, do you think, to vote to impeach the president?

nicholas fandos

So I think what they want is to continue moving towards these kind of inner concentric circles. So if they’ve talked to the ambassador now, next they want to hear from the White House budget office to hear what order exactly came down from President Trump to suspend the aid. What did that sound like? What did people in the office think? What debate happened there? They want to know what was happening in the National Security Council, where advisers and aides to the president were listening to a lot of these calls and interactions in real time, not to mention talking with him, and will have their own accounts as to what was going down. So basically, if Taylor has sketched in this important part of the picture, they’re looking for additional witnesses that are kind of even closer to the action to fill in kind of flourishes and details that will either back up or disprove what he had to say. Because ultimately, what this is really about is about President Trump. You’re not impeaching these other officials around him. The House would vote to impeach President Trump. And they need to be able to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt in the Senate. And so what they’re really after is as precise and vivid a picture as possible of what President Trump was doing and saying and meaning as he took these actions.

michael barbaro

Right. They want the closest thing possible to direct, irrefutable evidence that the president himself said, withhold this money until I get my investigation. And it sounds like on Tuesday, they got a lot closer to that, but perhaps not all the way.

nicholas fandos

That’s right, and that’s why the investigation will keep grinding on.

He likened the explanations from the White House and its surrogates to the way someone solves the game “Clue,” with its menagerie of possible culprits, weapons and crime scenes.

The show, which is airing on a half dozen stations in Virginia and Florida and streams on the website WarRoom.org, is a remarkably blunt attempt by former Trump aides to criticize and influence the work of current Trump administration officials. Even the show’s name is something of an affront to the White House — and to Mr. Trump himself. He has told aides that he does not want to create a war room, as crisis response operations are often nicknamed, because he is concerned that people would see it as an acknowledgment that he views the impeachment inquiry as legitimate.

Though many in the White House may be tempted to dismiss the show as a bootleg operation run by people cut off from Mr. Trump’s inner circle, Mr. Miller said in an interview that the president ultimately cares about one thing when it comes to managing a crisis of this magnitude: “Are there people defending me or not?”

Mr. Miller added that with the exception of a handful of Trump loyalists, “There is a serious lack of Trump allies jumping out there and defending the president.” Too few Republicans, he said, are questioning the process of the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, which he said was being run in a clandestine fashion from “Schiff’s secret Capitol basement bunker.” It was a reference to the secure hearing room in the Capitol where Representative Adam Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, is presiding over witness interviews.

The idea for the new program came to Mr. Bannon after he appeared last week on the radio show of John Fredericks, a conservative whose daily broadcast airs across Virginia. He was floored by the backlash he got when he stated what he said he assumed was accepted as fact among Republicans and Democrats alike: Mr. Trump is likely to be impeached."

“Let us in! Let us in!” shouted dozens of House Republicans, as they pushed past the doors of the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, a basement room in the Capitol where a Defense Department official had arrived Wednesday morning to testify in the inquiry.

Once inside, nearly 30 conservatives yelled, tweeted and ordered pizzas.

Chicago is a heavily Democratic city with a long history of backing labor unions. As teachers have marched through downtown and picketed outside schools in recent days, they have often been greeted by supportive car honks and parents offering apple cider and doughnuts. But Ms. Lightfoot and her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel , whose tenure included an especially bitter teachers’ strike in 2012, have struggled to reconcile demands from the union with the bleak finances of the city and the school system.

“Beyond what we put on the table, there is simply no more money,” Ms. Lightfoot said, taking a noticeably harsher tone this week than in the first days of the strike. She added: “Enough is enough. There is no further excuse to keep our kids out of school.”

Ms. Lightfoot suggested that she was unsurprised by Ms. Warren’s arrival, but did not expect it to change much for the city.

“She has her right to come in,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “I would expect all Democratic candidates for the presidency to support workers. That’s who we are as a party. But at the end of the day, what’s going to get it done is what happens at the bargaining table.”

Republicans were also skeptical of the visit.

“Teachers should be wary of any advice Elizabeth Warren may be relaying today in Chicago,” said Kevin Knoth, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee , in a statement that questioned the wisdom of Ms. Warren’s plan for spending billions of dollars more on education.

Mr. Biden had also tweeted an apology on Tuesday for using the term.

“I was wrong to have said it and I apologize for having said it,” Mr. Biden said on Wednesday.

But he also criticized Mr. Trump for using the term “lynching,” with its legacy of racist murders of African-Americans, to describe the impeachment inquiry he currently faces. Mr. Trump, he argued, was using the term “as a dog whistle.”

“When has he ever taken, when has he ever said a negative thing about a white supremacist?” Mr. Biden said of the president. “Have you heard him say anything? I haven’t.”

Mr. Biden’s appearance in Scranton came the same day that a new CNN national poll showed him with a commanding lead in the Democratic primary, with the support of 34 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters, followed by Ms. Warren at 19 percent and Senator Bernie Sanders at 16 percent. It is Mr. Biden’s widest lead in the CNN survey since shortly after he announced his bid for president.

But there is no national primary, of course, and Mr. Biden’s advantage in the early-primary states Iowa and New Hampshire has ebbed or evaporated. The CNN survey is a sign that nationally he has retained strong support despite facing weeks of unproved attacks by Mr. Trump on him and his son Hunter over their activities in Ukraine, an issue driving the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.

Mr. Biden’s economic prescriptions, less sweeping than those of other leading Democrats seeking the nomination, include a $15 federal minimum wage, tripling funding for schools with at-risk students, free community college and a plan for students to pay down their college debt by committing to community service.

Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate is only 3.9 percent, though it is 5.2 percent in Lackawanna County, where Scranton is. But a manufacturing downturn may be underway statewide, with 8,100 jobs lost this year so far, an issue that could cut into the president’s 2016 promises to restore industry in the Rust Belt."

A month later he dismissed criticisms of raising middle class taxes to pay for expanded health care, calling it “a distinction without a difference.”

By October, however, Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., had moved toward the center on all three issues . He has a climate-focused TV ad in which he says, “I believe that we need to have a plan that works for all of us.” The border crossings issue, he told CNN last week, is “the kind of stuff that gets us trapped.” And he’s a month into an attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for not explaining how she’d pay for an overhaul of health care.

For most of his political career, Mr. Buttigieg presented himself as more of a centrist technocrat than a liberal ideologue. But striving for attention in a crowded field, he spent the early part of the 2020 Democratic primary touting an array of aspirational progressive ideas, delivering speeches that could have been ripped from an Aaron Sorkin script.

Now a serious candidate with a policy staff stocked with Washington insiders and a war chest boasting millions from big donors, Mr. Buttigieg has gradually reinvented himself as more of a moderate.

Mr. Trump has tried to spin what he did as a good thing. “As the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!” he tweeted on Oct. 3.

Except that, as members of his own administration continue to clarify, this wasn’t a broad effort to root out corruption. It was a targeted campaign to pressure a foreign government to interfere with an American election on Mr. Trump’s behalf — apparently by holding hostage nearly $400 million in military aid.

He and many of his defenders have clung to the idea that there was no “quid pro quo,” a position rebutted on Tuesday by the testimony of William Taylor, the top American diplomat i n Ukraine.

Faced with this jaw-dropping account from the president’s own envoy, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, dismissed it as part of “a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.”

On Wednesday the president went further. He called Mr. Taylor “Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor” in one tweet and declared in another: “The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!”"

david shulkin

Secretary.

michael barbaro

Secretary?

david shulkin

Yeah.

michael barbaro

O.K. So I want to start with the email that you sent me, because I think it was interesting. You describe yourself as somebody who was fired essentially by a tweet from the president, and that that came after an ordeal that you went through that involved political appointees essentially undermining you. And you call the experience strangely, unusually relevant these days, with the issue of interference by outside political influences, and you specifically mentioned what happened to Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. And you said we should perhaps talk about it on “The Daily.” So here you are.

david shulkin

Well, at the time, of course, this all seemed very unique to me. But as I’ve now been out of the Trump administration for almost 18 months, I have noticed a similarity in the behaviors and the patterns.

archived recording 1 There’s a lot of talk about how the State Department seems to be sidelined in this administration — archived recording 2 — the senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy, George Kent, told House Committee lawmakers Tuesday he was sidelined from his job — archived recording 3 — that William Taylor told congressional investigators there were, quote, “two channels” for policymaking on Ukraine, quote, “one regular and one highly irregular.” archived recording 4 Certainly here investigators want to know more about how Yovanovitch ultimately became benched in this entire thing, how she became sidelined.

michael barbaro

So I want to get to that and why you think what happened to you is similar, but I want to start with your story — your experience with the Trump administration. How is it that you came to be considered for a cabinet position by President Trump?

david shulkin

Well, I was in the Obama administration. I was a presidential appointee. I was the undersecretary of health for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I had come from the private sector, where I’d been running hospitals, and if I was given the opportunity to help, I didn’t feel like I could say no. So I spent 18 months in the Obama administration, and I was watching very closely about who the Trump administration would choose for its leadership positions in the V.A. But as a political appointee of the Obama administration, I was preparing to leave like everyone else. I had prepared my resignation letter for January 20th, and every day I would hear that there was a new person being speculated on as the secretary of V.A. And as time went on, we found ourselves into January, just a few weeks right before the inauguration, without any idea of who that secretary would be.

archived recording We begin with a Fox News alert. We’re awaiting the start of that news conference with President-elect Donald Trump. His first —

david shulkin

I happen to have heard that the president-elect on January 11th was going to be giving a press conference. Then as I was watching the teaser on one of the cable networks, the reporter at the very end said the President-elect may be announcing the new Secretary of V.A.

archived recording (donald trump) Thank you very much. It’s very —

david shulkin

And I thought, if I had time, because I had a very busy day, I’d like to watch that —

michael barbaro

See who he chooses?

david shulkin

Yeah.

archived recording (donald trump) — for the veterans. And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we’ll do a news release in a little while. I’ll tell you about David. He’s fantastic.

david shulkin

And I watched the press briefing to find out that he announced me as secretary.

michael barbaro

So you learn that you will be secretary of the V.A. by watching the news, and the breaking news on television is literally breaking news to you?

david shulkin

Yes.

michael barbaro

O.K., so you start this job already with a feeling that this is going to be unorthodox. So I’m curious, how does this experience begin, and when do you start to detect what you described at the beginning of our conversation and that email that you sent us as something resembling interference?

david shulkin

Well, I started to understand that I should stop thinking about this new administration the way that the Obama administration ran. The way the White House worked, from my perspective when I was in the Obama administration, it was a very tightly run ship. In the new administration, there was not a tight approach to how you navigated through the White House and had access to the president. It was pretty loose. So I’m the only member of the cabinet at this point who had been in their job, essentially, and in the administration prior, so I knew what needed to happen. I had a plan. So this looseness in the White House was something that I actually found very refreshing, and I was able to use, I think, to the advantage of the department and to veterans, in that, while others were just learning about their agencies, I knew what we needed to do. So the first large part of the year after the inauguration was a time of great productivity, but I think there were a couple events that started to make me question and wonder whether there was a dual path of decision-making in the White House. One event happened to be nationally televised.

archived recording (donald trump) I want to thank you all for being here.

david shulkin

We were sitting in the Roosevelt Room with the president next to me, and he turned to me, and he said —

archived recording (donald trump) We’re having a meeting tonight at what we call, affectionately, the “Southern White House.” Seems to be the most convenient location. Everybody always wants to go to the Southern White House.

david shulkin

— so, will I see you in Florida this weekend at the meeting on veterans policy and veterans issues?

archived recording (donald trump) So are you going to be at that meeting? You heard about it, right? It’s going to be great. All about the V.A.

david shulkin

And that was the first time I’d heard about it.

michael barbaro

Even though you are the secretary of Veterans Affairs?

david shulkin

Yes. And so I looked at him, and I smiled, because I thought it was somewhat humorous, and I just shook my head no. And I remember that time, because my daughter, Jenny, sent me a email saying that I was now a meme. And I didn’t know what a meme was, so I had to Google being a meme. And I quickly learned what a meme was, and saw that there was this meme of me shaking my head no. I had no idea what he was talking about.

michael barbaro

So the meme was of a cabinet secretary being out of the loop?

david shulkin

Yes, yes. But there clearly were these two paths of information about veterans issues — the ones that came directly for me, and the ones that were coming from other people.

michael barbaro

And what did you learn about who was providing this alternate path of information? Who are these people?

david shulkin

I think that there was a group of appointees — political appointees — in the Department of Veterans Affairs that would, on a regular basis, go over to the White House and have meetings on their own. The Department of Veterans Affairs gets about 30 of these political appointees. They are often appointed because of their political allegiance. They come off the campaign, or they’re found to be supportive of the administration, and they get placed in the department in key roles. So we had about 30 of them.

michael barbaro

O.K., so what do you understand about why there would be a parallel system? Like, what would be necessary about that? Why would anyone construct a second path of information to the president?

david shulkin

Well —

michael barbaro

I mean, they’ve got you.

david shulkin

Well, part of this is speculation, since they weren’t willing to surface these issues and policy disagreements with me, but I believe that there were two issues. One was that they didn’t feel that I was moving fast enough and aggressive enough to fix the department. And I think that that is a reasonable point of view. I was balancing what I believed the pace that the organization could handle change and also what veterans wanted. But secondly, there was a basic disagreement over how fast and how far I was willing to take resources from the V.A. and shift them to the private sector.

michael barbaro

And what did the background figures you’re describing here, what did they want when it comes to privatization?

david shulkin

Our biggest disagreement sounds technical, but it turns out to be very important. They’re called access standards, and the access standards are the rules in which veterans can choose to go outside of the V.A. health care system and get their care.

michael barbaro

To a private doctor that’s not in the V.A.?

david shulkin

To a private doctor that’s not in the V.A. And philosophically, I was in agreement that every veteran should have a choice about where they get their care, but I wanted to do this in a way that would not destroy the current V.A. system. Because my belief is that the V.A. is doing things that the private sector is not doing well, and therefore we needed to keep this a strong system and actually enhance its capabilities. But those that argued for open access standards immediately, my concern was we would see such an immediate shift in resources before the V.A. could be fixed that it would ultimately lead to a complete privatization of the department. The way I described it, it was like turning on a faucet. Rather than turning it on full thrust all of a sudden, I wanted to turn it on slowly and give the V.A. system and the private sector time to adapt to this type of philosophical change. So I believe that that was the issue that I fought hardest on and ultimately ended up costing me my job.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. How does this other faction respond to your resistance to the speed and the scale of what they’re pushing for, which is a much broader privatization plan than I think it sounds like you’re comfortable with?

david shulkin

Well, the legislative proposal with the approach that I believe is the right one gets presented to the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, which is a half-Republican, half-Democratic committee. And the vote is taken in the Senate committee — 14 in favor of the approach that I want to take, and one person, one senator, opposing it.

michael barbaro

Good sign for you.

david shulkin

I thought so. But the White House sided strongly with the one senator who wanted the much more aggressive access standards. And ultimately, the bill that got passed was the version that the one senator wanted.

michael barbaro

I guess I’m trying to understand — when you say the White House supported a different vision in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, what does that mean, the White House? Aren’t you part at the White House? You’re the secretary of the V.A., so what does that even mean?

david shulkin

It was a very confusing situation, because normally, the secretary speaks for the administration, and I was directly speaking to the president and had the president’s support. So this is where I became aware that there was a dual decision-making process even in the White House itself. What clearly was happening behind the scenes was that there was back-channel information being given to the president, ultimately to the point that he must have decided, with that information, that I actually wasn’t following policy that he wanted to happen. But that was a surprise to me.

michael barbaro

And that back-channel information, as best you can tell, who was it coming from?

david shulkin

I have no idea.

michael barbaro

So it feels like you’re now in this kind of upside-down world, where you are supposed to be the most powerful person in the V.A., you are now fighting your own administration over legislation, and people around you are kind of eager to circumvent you and cut you out of the process. But they are leaving you in place. You are very much the undisputed secretary of the V.A. So how or when does that start to change?

david shulkin

I think that this situation, where there was clearly a battle for who was going to be making the policy, got to the point that this group of political appointees felt that they wanted to see somebody else running the department, and out of frustration, I think, started to resort to ways to try to decrease the authority and the effectiveness that I had. And that’s where I believe that they perfected the art of the leak. In Washington, an allegation, even without fact, has a way of taking a life on its own. So there was information leaked about my travel, and there was misinformation that a trip to Europe was a inappropriate trip, where, in fact, what was not reported was that this trip to Europe was the Five Eyes conference, which were the five allies that have met for 45 years, attended by every secretary of the V.A. previously. And the allegation being that my wife was paid for to be able to attend this trip on a shopping vacation or a European vacation. In fact, the United Kingdom, who was the host of this event in London, had officially invited my wife, who is a physician, who attended these meetings and lectures. And a travel arrangement like this was months in the planning, where everything, especially my wife’s travel, was vetted by the V.A. ethics attorneys, by other staff members in the V.A., by the White House, by the State Department. We did not accept any per diems or any other funds associated with this, but there was an allegation that this was done inappropriately, when, in fact, I just relied upon the V.A., who makes my travel arrangements to do this. Now, when a secretary travels, there are two itineraries that are produced. There is a public itinerary about the public appearances, and then there is an itinerary that is prepared for security about every stop and every place that the secretary will be. Those are confidential. Those were leaked to the press, as well.

michael barbaro

So it sounds like you’re seeing leaks, in this case, of secure documents that only your internal staff would have access to, given to the press to suggest that you are crossing lines — that, for example, you and your family are cashing in on your position as secretary of the V.A., and this is a very intentional sabotaging of your status.

david shulkin

Yes, that’s right. And while I’m a scientist, I’m a physician, so I don’t like to jump to conclusions unless I have facts. And so while many people were telling me that I was being sabotaged, that people were working against me, I chose not to make a conclusion until I had facts. And then one day, my deputy secretary brings to me a email that his staff member found left on the copy machine. It is from the senior political appointee to other political appointees that says, here is the plan. We are going to work to replace the secretary.

michael barbaro

Wow.

david shulkin

We are going to replace the deputy secretary, because he’s not politically aligned with us — a lifelong Republican, by the way. We are going to replace the chief of staff, and we’re going to replace the acting undersecretary. And we’re going to put in place people that are politically aligned with us.

michael barbaro

Who leaves that memo on the copy machine?

david shulkin

It was careless.

michael barbaro

But it was also very explicit and candid.

david shulkin

And now, as a scientist, I had my evidence. I actually now could see exactly what was going on.

michael barbaro

So I just want to be clear. Prior to all this, you very well understand that there are people talking behind your back about policy, going to the president, telling him, this is what should be done, that might differ from you. But now it’s advanced to a different place, where these people aren’t just happy talking around your back, they are trying to stab you in the back. They’re trying to get rid of you.

david shulkin

That’s correct.

michael barbaro

Did it ever occur to you, because you are secretary of the V.A., just to fire a bunch of these people who seem to be very much working to undermine you, because you are their boss?

david shulkin

It’s exactly what I did. I tried to remove them.

michael barbaro

And what happened?

david shulkin

They were told by the White House that they would not be removed, and I was told to stand down by the White House, that I could not remove them.

michael barbaro

Wow.

david shulkin

That emboldened them, knowing that they were protected.

michael barbaro

So tell me the story of how this all kind of came to a head.

david shulkin

Well, there had been lots of speculation about whether I would resign, or whether the president would replace me. I was talking to the president on a regular basis, and I was talking very specifically to General Kelly, who was chief of staff. And on the day that I was fired, I had heard a rumor that maybe I would be fired that day, so I called General Kelly and I said, look, here’s what I’m hearing. And he said, I don’t know anything about it. Let me check into it and call you back. And he called me back promptly, as he often did, and he said, David, I checked into it. There’s no truth to it. I spoke to the president. You have his confidence. Keep on doing what you’re doing. And then about noon that day, the president called me, and we had a discussion about what was happening at V.A. And I was able to tell him that we were working very hard and about to deliver three new policy objectives for him, and he was inquisitive about those policy objectives — a normal conversation — and said, keep going on doing what you’re doing, and let’s talk more about it tomorrow. And about five hours later —

archived recording Breaking news from the White House tonight. President Trump fired his secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin. President has tweeted, “I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronnie L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs,” which means the current Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin has now resigned. Why —

david shulkin

And that’s really the only and last time that I heard from the president.

michael barbaro

Was in a tweet?

david shulkin

Yes.

michael barbaro

So in the end, it sounds like you see yourself as a Trump appointee, very committed to the mission of your department, who was systematically undermined by political appointees who were really determined to push through their agenda and what they saw as the president’s agenda kind of at all costs. And that you became an obstacle. And that does sound kind of familiar in this moment. What do you see as the parallels to what has just happened when it comes to Ukraine? I assume you have been following it just as closely as we have.

david shulkin

Well, I think being a public servant focused on the mission of improving services to Americans, and then feeling that misinformation is being presented to the president by people who have other agendas that shortens your ability to serve, I think, is something that doesn’t work for the overall benefit of government. The parallels that I see are that there are outside people who ultimately end up having a big impact on the way the government runs, and I do think that what we’re seeing with the way that the president tends to get information from select individuals, that that really has a big influence on the way that decisions are being made. And it’s important that a president get the right information so they can make the right decisions. And my concern is that we may put policies in place that have consequences for decades to come.

michael barbaro

And finally, secretary, why is this story important for you to be telling? Not a lot of former secretaries in this administration — former generals, former national security advisers — talk about these experiences.

david shulkin

Yeah, I think it’s a duty to share what one’s learned in government, with the result of trying to make this better. I am not trying to throw mud at anybody or to make criticisms of any particular political party. I am trying to be transparent about what happened in my experience so that we can learn from it and make a government that works better for all of us.

michael barbaro

I mean, your book is called, “It Shouldn’t Be This Hard to Serve Your Country.”

david shulkin

That’s right. I am very concerned about the future of public service, and I’m concerned about the future for our veterans. And to have people who are willing to come from the private sector, like myself, and help in government and serve to be put through this type of situation in this type of environment, I think, is going to end up being a big problem for people wanting to come in the future. And so when I say it shouldn’t be this hard to serve your country, the scenario of being systematically undermined I don’t think is a good thing for us in terms of the way that we should be running this country.

michael barbaro

I wonder, can you confidently recommend, if someone comes to you, to serve in a position in the cabinet right now?

david shulkin

My hope is that people will continue to raise their hand to want to serve, but anybody who were to choose to go into this administration needs to understand that it’s likely not to end well, and that people have to be clear about the principles that they have and their belief system and make sure that they stick to that.

michael barbaro

Secretary, thank you very much.

david shulkin

Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

michael barbaro

In a dramatic act of protest, House Republicans stormed into the secure offices where impeachment investigators have been hearing testimony behind closed doors and temporarily disrupted the proceedings. The Republicans, all allies of President Trump, demanded that the impeachment testimony be held in public. But because none of the Republicans are members of the committees conducting the hearings, they were eventually removed from the secure offices. And —

In a surprise move on Wednesday, President Trump said he would end the economic sanctions he imposed against Turkey for its deadly invasion of Syria just a week after creating them, saying that he trusted Turkey to abide by a ceasefire.

archived recording (donald trump) So the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we’re not happy with.

michael barbaro

But in a sign of bipartisan fury over Trump’s approach, Democratic and Republican senators challenged the president’s special envoy to Syria, James Jeffrey, about the original decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which allowed Turkey to kill hundreds of Kurds and for ISIS fighters to escape from prisons.

archived recording (bob menendez) And you know, Ambassador Jeffrey, I have the greatest respect for you. But one can try to put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig. One can ultimately call capitulation a victory, but it’s still capitulation. And one can ultimately have a retreat and say it’s strategic, but it’s still a retreat. And that’s, I feel, exactly what’s happened here.

He did so at the expense of longstanding foreign policy, a critical international alliance and the stability of the global order — and he used hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to do it.

The nation has known the basic outlines of this story for weeks, thanks to the bravery of a C.I.A. whistle-blower and others. But in 15 pages, Mr. Taylor laid out with a stunning degree of detail the extent of Mr. Trump’s effort to extort Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son over supposed corruption.

You know it’s bad for the president when the only response the White House can muster is to sidestep the testimony and complain instead about “a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.”

Would that be the same Constitution that Mr. Trump referred to, in part, as “phony” just this week ? Also, “radical unelected bureaucrat” is a curious way to describe Mr. Taylor, who currently serves as Mr. Trump’s acting envoy to Ukraine and is a retired career civil servant and Vietnam War veteran who has served under both Republican and Democratic presidents."

Taylor Jr., th e top American diplomat in Ukraine, who testified in excruciating detail about a quid pro quo in which Mr. Trump and his allies held up security aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden.

Privately, White House officials concede they are losing the messaging battle with Democrats, whose inquiry has produced a series of devastating revelations about allegations that the president and his allies conducted a campaign to pressure Ukraine for his own political gain.

People close to Mr. Trump said that the coming weeks will be marked by an increased assault on the integrity of the inquiry itself as the White House tries to avoid litigating the facts of what took place between Ukrainian officials and Mr. Trump’s loyalists, including Rudolph W.

White House aides are planning to add communications aides dedicated to impeachment, a move that Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, has pushed for. Among those under consideration to help lead the new team is Tony Sayegh, who recently left the Treasury Department where he was the top spokesman.

Stephen K. Bannon, who was pushed out as the White House chief strategist in August 2017, has also created an unofficial war room in the basement of his Capitol Hill townhouse to wage over the radio a messaging war on the Democratic impeachment effort.

Mr. Graham said that Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s acting chief of staff, has assured him that the White House is “working on getting a messaging team together” and said he hoped it would be as effective as the one that Bill Clinton’s White House assembled during Mr. Clinton’s impeachment in the late 1990s."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Before the career diplomats who deal with Ukraine discovered a shadowy power structure around President Trump that was determined to undermine and derail them, a little-known Trump cabinet secretary said that the same thing happened to him. A conversation with former Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin. It’s Thursday, October 24. Do you go by Secretary —

david shulkin

Secretary.

michael barbaro

— or Doctor?

david shulkin

Secretary.

michael barbaro

Secretary?

david shulkin

Yeah.

michael barbaro

O.K. So I want to start with the email that you sent me, because I think it was interesting. You describe yourself as somebody who was fired essentially by a tweet from the president, and that that came after an ordeal that you went through that involved political appointees essentially undermining you. And you call the experience strangely, unusually relevant these days, with the issue of interference by outside political influences, and you specifically mentioned what happened to Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. And you said we should perhaps talk about it on “The Daily.” So here you are.

david shulkin

Well, at the time, of course, this all seemed very unique to me. But as I’ve now been out of the Trump administration for almost 18 months, I have noticed a similarity in the behaviors and the patterns.

archived recording 1 There’s a lot of talk about how the State Department seems to be sidelined in this administration — archived recording 2 — the senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy, George Kent, told House Committee lawmakers Tuesday he was sidelined from his job — archived recording 3 — that William Taylor told congressional investigators there were, quote, “two channels” for policymaking on Ukraine, quote, “one regular and one highly irregular.” archived recording 4 Certainly here investigators want to know more about how Yovanovitch ultimately became benched in this entire thing, how she became sidelined.

michael barbaro

So I want to get to that and why you think what happened to you is similar, but I want to start with your story — your experience with the Trump administration. How is it that you came to be considered for a cabinet position by President Trump?

david shulkin

Well, I was in the Obama administration. I was a presidential appointee. I was the undersecretary of health for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I had come from the private sector, where I’d been running hospitals, and if I was given the opportunity to help, I didn’t feel like I could say no. So I spent 18 months in the Obama administration, and I was watching very closely about who the Trump administration would choose for its leadership positions in the V.A. But as a political appointee of the Obama administration, I was preparing to leave like everyone else. I had prepared my resignation letter for January 20th, and every day I would hear that there was a new person being speculated on as the secretary of V.A. And as time went on, we found ourselves into January, just a few weeks right before the inauguration, without any idea of who that secretary would be.

archived recording We begin with a Fox News alert. We’re awaiting the start of that news conference with President-elect Donald Trump. His first —

david shulkin

I happen to have heard that the president-elect on January 11th was going to be giving a press conference. Then as I was watching the teaser on one of the cable networks, the reporter at the very end said the President-elect may be announcing the new Secretary of V.A.

archived recording (donald trump) Thank you very much. It’s very —

david shulkin

And I thought, if I had time, because I had a very busy day, I’d like to watch that —

michael barbaro

See who he chooses?

david shulkin

Yeah.

archived recording (donald trump) — for the veterans. And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we’ll do a news release in a little while. I’ll tell you about David. He’s fantastic.

david shulkin

And I watched the press briefing to find out that he announced me as secretary.

michael barbaro

So you learn that you will be secretary of the V.A. by watching the news, and the breaking news on television is literally breaking news to you?

david shulkin

Yes.

michael barbaro

O.K., so you start this job already with a feeling that this is going to be unorthodox. So I’m curious, how does this experience begin, and when do you start to detect what you described at the beginning of our conversation and that email that you sent us as something resembling interference?

david shulkin

Well, I started to understand that I should stop thinking about this new administration the way that the Obama administration ran. The way the White House worked, from my perspective when I was in the Obama administration, it was a very tightly run ship. In the new administration, there was not a tight approach to how you navigated through the White House and had access to the president. It was pretty loose. So I’m the only member of the cabinet at this point who had been in their job, essentially, and in the administration prior, so I knew what needed to happen. I had a plan. So this looseness in the White House was something that I actually found very refreshing, and I was able to use, I think, to the advantage of the department and to veterans, in that, while others were just learning about their agencies, I knew what we needed to do. So the first large part of the year after the inauguration was a time of great productivity, but I think there were a couple events that started to make me question and wonder whether there was a dual path of decision-making in the White House. One event happened to be nationally televised.

archived recording (donald trump) I want to thank you all for being here.

david shulkin

We were sitting in the Roosevelt Room with the president next to me, and he turned to me, and he said —

archived recording (donald trump) We’re having a meeting tonight at what we call, affectionately, the “Southern White House.” Seems to be the most convenient location. Everybody always wants to go to the Southern White House.

david shulkin

— so, will I see you in Florida this weekend at the meeting on veterans policy and veterans issues?

archived recording (donald trump) So are you going to be at that meeting? You heard about it, right? It’s going to be great. All about the V.A.

david shulkin

And that was the first time I’d heard about it.

michael barbaro

Even though you are the secretary of Veterans Affairs?

david shulkin

Yes. And so I looked at him, and I smiled, because I thought it was somewhat humorous, and I just shook my head no. And I remember that time, because my daughter, Jenny, sent me a email saying that I was now a meme. And I didn’t know what a meme was, so I had to Google being a meme. And I quickly learned what a meme was, and saw that there was this meme of me shaking my head no. I had no idea what he was talking about.

michael barbaro

So the meme was of a cabinet secretary being out of the loop?

david shulkin

Yes, yes. But there clearly were these two paths of information about veterans issues — the ones that came directly for me, and the ones that were coming from other people.

michael barbaro

And what did you learn about who was providing this alternate path of information? Who are these people?

david shulkin

I think that there was a group of appointees — political appointees — in the Department of Veterans Affairs that would, on a regular basis, go over to the White House and have meetings on their own. The Department of Veterans Affairs gets about 30 of these political appointees. They are often appointed because of their political allegiance. They come off the campaign, or they’re found to be supportive of the administration, and they get placed in the department in key roles. So we had about 30 of them.

michael barbaro

O.K., so what do you understand about why there would be a parallel system? Like, what would be necessary about that? Why would anyone construct a second path of information to the president?

david shulkin

Well —

michael barbaro

I mean, they’ve got you.

david shulkin

Well, part of this is speculation, since they weren’t willing to surface these issues and policy disagreements with me, but I believe that there were two issues. One was that they didn’t feel that I was moving fast enough and aggressive enough to fix the department. And I think that that is a reasonable point of view. I was balancing what I believed the pace that the organization could handle change and also what veterans wanted. But secondly, there was a basic disagreement over how fast and how far I was willing to take resources from the V.A. and shift them to the private sector.

michael barbaro

And what did the background figures you’re describing here, what did they want when it comes to privatization?

david shulkin

Our biggest disagreement sounds technical, but it turns out to be very important. They’re called access standards, and the access standards are the rules in which veterans can choose to go outside of the V.A. health care system and get their care.

michael barbaro

To a private doctor that’s not in the V.A.?

david shulkin

To a private doctor that’s not in the V.A. And philosophically, I was in agreement that every veteran should have a choice about where they get their care, but I wanted to do this in a way that would not destroy the current V.A. system. Because my belief is that the V.A. is doing things that the private sector is not doing well, and therefore we needed to keep this a strong system and actually enhance its capabilities. But those that argued for open access standards immediately, my concern was we would see such an immediate shift in resources before the V.A. could be fixed that it would ultimately lead to a complete privatization of the department. The way I described it, it was like turning on a faucet. Rather than turning it on full thrust all of a sudden, I wanted to turn it on slowly and give the V.A. system and the private sector time to adapt to this type of philosophical change. So I believe that that was the issue that I fought hardest on and ultimately ended up costing me my job.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. How does this other faction respond to your resistance to the speed and the scale of what they’re pushing for, which is a much broader privatization plan than I think it sounds like you’re comfortable with?

david shulkin

Well, the legislative proposal with the approach that I believe is the right one gets presented to the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, which is a half-Republican, half-Democratic committee. And the vote is taken in the Senate committee — 14 in favor of the approach that I want to take, and one person, one senator, opposing it.

michael barbaro

Good sign for you.

david shulkin

I thought so. But the White House sided strongly with the one senator who wanted the much more aggressive access standards. And ultimately, the bill that got passed was the version that the one senator wanted.

michael barbaro

I guess I’m trying to understand — when you say the White House supported a different vision in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, what does that mean, the White House? Aren’t you part at the White House? You’re the secretary of the V.A., so what does that even mean?

david shulkin

It was a very confusing situation, because normally, the secretary speaks for the administration, and I was directly speaking to the president and had the president’s support. So this is where I became aware that there was a dual decision-making process even in the White House itself. What clearly was happening behind the scenes was that there was back-channel information being given to the president, ultimately to the point that he must have decided, with that information, that I actually wasn’t following policy that he wanted to happen. But that was a surprise to me.

michael barbaro

And that back-channel information, as best you can tell, who was it coming from?

david shulkin

I have no idea.

michael barbaro

So it feels like you’re now in this kind of upside-down world, where you are supposed to be the most powerful person in the V.A., you are now fighting your own administration over legislation, and people around you are kind of eager to circumvent you and cut you out of the process. But they are leaving you in place. You are very much the undisputed secretary of the V.A. So how or when does that start to change?

david shulkin

I think that this situation, where there was clearly a battle for who was going to be making the policy, got to the point that this group of political appointees felt that they wanted to see somebody else running the department, and out of frustration, I think, started to resort to ways to try to decrease the authority and the effectiveness that I had. And that’s where I believe that they perfected the art of the leak. In Washington, an allegation, even without fact, has a way of taking a life on its own. So there was information leaked about my travel, and there was misinformation that a trip to Europe was a inappropriate trip, where, in fact, what was not reported was that this trip to Europe was the Five Eyes conference, which were the five allies that have met for 45 years, attended by every secretary of the V.A. previously. And the allegation being that my wife was paid for to be able to attend this trip on a shopping vacation or a European vacation. In fact, the United Kingdom, who was the host of this event in London, had officially invited my wife, who is a physician, who attended these meetings and lectures. And a travel arrangement like this was months in the planning, where everything, especially my wife’s travel, was vetted by the V.A. ethics attorneys, by other staff members in the V.A., by the White House, by the State Department. We did not accept any per diems or any other funds associated with this, but there was an allegation that this was done inappropriately, when, in fact, I just relied upon the V.A., who makes my travel arrangements to do this. Now, when a secretary travels, there are two itineraries that are produced. There is a public itinerary about the public appearances, and then there is an itinerary that is prepared for security about every stop and every place that the secretary will be. Those are confidential. Those were leaked to the press, as well.

michael barbaro

So it sounds like you’re seeing leaks, in this case, of secure documents that only your internal staff would have access to, given to the press to suggest that you are crossing lines — that, for example, you and your family are cashing in on your position as secretary of the V.A., and this is a very intentional sabotaging of your status.

david shulkin

Yes, that’s right. And while I’m a scientist, I’m a physician, so I don’t like to jump to conclusions unless I have facts. And so while many people were telling me that I was being sabotaged, that people were working against me, I chose not to make a conclusion until I had facts. And then one day, my deputy secretary brings to me a email that his staff member found left on the copy machine. It is from the senior political appointee to other political appointees that says, here is the plan. We are going to work to replace the secretary.

michael barbaro

Wow.

david shulkin

We are going to replace the deputy secretary, because he’s not politically aligned with us — a lifelong Republican, by the way. We are going to replace the chief of staff, and we’re going to replace the acting undersecretary. And we’re going to put in place people that are politically aligned with us.

michael barbaro

Who leaves that memo on the copy machine?

david shulkin

It was careless.

michael barbaro

But it was also very explicit and candid.

david shulkin

And now, as a scientist, I had my evidence. I actually now could see exactly what was going on.

michael barbaro

So I just want to be clear. Prior to all this, you very well understand that there are people talking behind your back about policy, going to the president, telling him, this is what should be done, that might differ from you. But now it’s advanced to a different place, where these people aren’t just happy talking around your back, they are trying to stab you in the back. They’re trying to get rid of you.

david shulkin

That’s correct.

michael barbaro

Did it ever occur to you, because you are secretary of the V.A., just to fire a bunch of these people who seem to be very much working to undermine you, because you are their boss?

david shulkin

It’s exactly what I did. I tried to remove them.

michael barbaro

And what happened?

david shulkin

They were told by the White House that they would not be removed, and I was told to stand down by the White House, that I could not remove them.

michael barbaro

Wow.

david shulkin

That emboldened them, knowing that they were protected.

michael barbaro

So tell me the story of how this all kind of came to a head.

david shulkin

Well, there had been lots of speculation about whether I would resign, or whether the president would replace me. I was talking to the president on a regular basis, and I was talking very specifically to General Kelly, who was chief of staff. And on the day that I was fired, I had heard a rumor that maybe I would be fired that day, so I called General Kelly and I said, look, here’s what I’m hearing. And he said, I don’t know anything about it. Let me check into it and call you back. And he called me back promptly, as he often did, and he said, David, I checked into it. There’s no truth to it. I spoke to the president. You have his confidence. Keep on doing what you’re doing. And then about noon that day, the president called me, and we had a discussion about what was happening at V.A. And I was able to tell him that we were working very hard and about to deliver three new policy objectives for him, and he was inquisitive about those policy objectives — a normal conversation — and said, keep going on doing what you’re doing, and let’s talk more about it tomorrow. And about five hours later —

archived recording Breaking news from the White House tonight. President Trump fired his secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin. President has tweeted, “I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronnie L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs,” which means the current Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin has now resigned. Why —

david shulkin

And that’s really the only and last time that I heard from the president.

michael barbaro

Was in a tweet?

david shulkin

Yes.

michael barbaro

So in the end, it sounds like you see yourself as a Trump appointee, very committed to the mission of your department, who was systematically undermined by political appointees who were really determined to push through their agenda and what they saw as the president’s agenda kind of at all costs. And that you became an obstacle. And that does sound kind of familiar in this moment. What do you see as the parallels to what has just happened when it comes to Ukraine? I assume you have been following it just as closely as we have.

david shulkin

Well, I think being a public servant focused on the mission of improving services to Americans, and then feeling that misinformation is being presented to the president by people who have other agendas that shortens your ability to serve, I think, is something that doesn’t work for the overall benefit of government. The parallels that I see are that there are outside people who ultimately end up having a big impact on the way the government runs, and I do think that what we’re seeing with the way that the president tends to get information from select individuals, that that really has a big influence on the way that decisions are being made. And it’s important that a president get the right information so they can make the right decisions. And my concern is that we may put policies in place that have consequences for decades to come.

michael barbaro

And finally, secretary, why is this story important for you to be telling? Not a lot of former secretaries in this administration — former generals, former national security advisers — talk about these experiences.

david shulkin

Yeah, I think it’s a duty to share what one’s learned in government, with the result of trying to make this better. I am not trying to throw mud at anybody or to make criticisms of any particular political party. I am trying to be transparent about what happened in my experience so that we can learn from it and make a government that works better for all of us.

michael barbaro

I mean, your book is called, “It Shouldn’t Be This Hard to Serve Your Country.”

david shulkin

That’s right. I am very concerned about the future of public service, and I’m concerned about the future for our veterans. And to have people who are willing to come from the private sector, like myself, and help in government and serve to be put through this type of situation in this type of environment, I think, is going to end up being a big problem for people wanting to come in the future. And so when I say it shouldn’t be this hard to serve your country, the scenario of being systematically undermined I don’t think is a good thing for us in terms of the way that we should be running this country.

michael barbaro

I wonder, can you confidently recommend, if someone comes to you, to serve in a position in the cabinet right now?

david shulkin

My hope is that people will continue to raise their hand to want to serve, but anybody who were to choose to go into this administration needs to understand that it’s likely not to end well, and that people have to be clear about the principles that they have and their belief system and make sure that they stick to that.

michael barbaro

Secretary, thank you very much.

david shulkin

Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

michael barbaro

In a dramatic act of protest, House Republicans stormed into the secure offices where impeachment investigators have been hearing testimony behind closed doors and temporarily disrupted the proceedings. The Republicans, all allies of President Trump, demanded that the impeachment testimony be held in public. But because none of the Republicans are members of the committees conducting the hearings, they were eventually removed from the secure offices. And —

But in a sign of bipartisan fury over Trump’s approach, Democratic and Republican senators challenged the president’s special envoy to Syria, James Jeffrey, about the original decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which allowed Turkey to kill hundreds of Kurds and for ISIS fighters to escape from prisons.

archived recording (bob menendez) And you know, Ambassador Jeffrey, I have the greatest respect for you. But one can try to put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig.

And that’s, I feel, exactly what’s happened here.

[LAUGHS]

[music]

michael barbaro

Nick Fandos covers Congress for The Times. Nick, where did we leave off with you last week?

nicholas fandos

So remember, last week we heard testimony from a string of American diplomats, both career diplomats and political appointees working for Donald Trump. And what they describe day after day in testimony was, essentially, the traditional American foreign policy apparatus getting sidelined or pushed aside by President Trump, his personal lawyer, and a cadre of political appointees who were close around him and were setting the agenda for the country’s policy toward Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Right. And the names that kept coming up again and again were Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland?

nicholas fandos

That’s right. And by Thursday, we heard from Sondland himself, who you’ll remember is the ambassador to the European Union. He’s a former Trump political donor. Sondland, after witness after witness this week had placed him at the center of this shadow foreign policy, if you will, came in and essentially said, hey, I know there’s all this attention on me, but I was merely following the directions of President Trump.

michael barbaro

And Nick, what did we hear in this testimony about what the point of this shadow structure was? Why have it? What are they up to?

nicholas fandos

So a lot of this testimony revolved around a meeting that the Ukrainians wanted to have with President Trump at the White House that they believed would lend credibility to the new administration in that country. And the questions that came up again and again were, was there a quid pro quo that the Trump administration was trying to extract investigations from the Ukrainians into the president’s political rivals in exchange for that meeting? That they were holding out that meeting and saying, we’ll only give you this if we get what we want. But what’s interesting is what they weren’t testifying about. For the most part, there was very little discussion last week of the military aid that President Trump had ordered to be frozen this summer. This is almost $400 million in security funds that Congress allocated in a bipartisan fashion for Ukraine. And there have been allegations, first from the whistle-blower that initiated this case and throughout, that that aid may have been frozen as a leverage point as well, as another kind of quid pro quo to extract these politically advantageous investigations. But we weren’t hearing a whole lot about that as the week wore on.

michael barbaro

Right. There were two allegations of a quid pro quo. There was the White House visit in exchange for these investigations, and then there was this $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. And my sense is that the allegation that the military aid had been held up in this scheme was by far the more explosive of the two.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. Remember, when House Democrats launched this impeachment inquiry a little bit more than a month ago, it was the prospect of $400 million in bipartisan approved military aid that had most alarmed lawmakers in both parties. It’s that military aid that got moderate Democrats, the ones from swing districts that President Trump won in 2016 who are kind of teetering on the edge as they face re-election, to come on board and say, yes, we do support an inquiry. They threw crucial support behind this investigation explicitly because it was tied to national security.

michael barbaro

Right. And what did you make of the fact that the money, which had been the source of so much focus, wasn’t really coming up? Did that at all cause you to wonder, as I will admit it did for me, if the military aid aspect of the story maybe just wasn’t there? If it hadn’t maybe been something that the president was holding over Ukraine to get these investigations he wanted into the Democrats?

nicholas fandos

I think that that certainly began to feel like more of a possibility. The Trump administration has given publicly other reasons for withholding this aid. And in some respects, it makes sense that they would have withheld it when they were looking to cut down on the expensive foreign aid all over the country. So —

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

— I wouldn’t have been altogether surprised if that part of the story continued to shrink away. At the same time, so much of what the original whistle-blower — who has brought this case to the fore, who helped launch this impeachment inquiry indirectly — has alleged has borne out to date, that I don’t think we could fully rule out the idea that the aid had been held up as leverage for these investigations. And so it just remained a kind of open, tantalizing question, will this bear out or won’t it? And that’s where we pick things up this week.

michael barbaro

O.K., so get us up to speed about what actually happened on Tuesday.

nicholas fandos

So on Tuesday morning, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine right now, arrived on Capitol Hill for his own deposition with House impeachment investigators.

michael barbaro

And what we need to know about Bill Taylor besides that?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor is another one of these career national security officials who has served Democrats and Republicans. He’s been serving the country, he told investigators today, for 50 years, starting as a cadet at West Point, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem. During George W. Bush’s administration, he was an ambassador to Ukraine. And he had actually retired when the State Department contacted him early this year, after Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, was ousted by President Trump, and asked him if he’d be willing to come back to take control of the American mission in Ukraine and help to implement the president’s policies. And he began explaining to investigators today that he knew, in a sense, what he was getting into, and he had real pause as he looked toward taking this job. He sought assurances from the State Department, essentially, that he would be able to exercise policy as he saw fit and that he wasn’t going to be a victim of the same kind of political games that she was. With those assurances, he ultimately decided in May that he would sign up. And he flew over to Kiev and began his role as ambassador. What came next, he made pretty clear, is something like his worst nightmare.

nicholas fandos

And on Tuesday, he outlined that nightmare in a 15-page opening statement, which he read methodically over 40 minutes —

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

— to investigators gathered behind closed doors.

michael barbaro

And what does he say in this opening statement?

nicholas fandos

So Taylor begins a lot — like a lot of witnesses last week began. He describes two channels of foreign policy, an official channel and the kind of shadow or irregular channel, toward Ukraine. And he says basically, at first, these things are aligned. He told investigators, when I first arrived in Kiev in June and July, the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy served the same goal — a strong U.S.-Ukrainian partnership. But what he documents in copious notes and calls that he reconstructs and experiences that he has with other diplomats involved is a divergence of those two channels, a disintegration of the first one, essentially, in favor of the second. And he says, it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives.

michael barbaro

And what happened that led him to feel by August that there were two different sets of priorities here, that these things were no longer in line?

nicholas fandos

So it’s not long after Taylor arrives in Ukraine that it becomes increasingly clear to him that something funny is going on. At first, he hears from Ambassador Sondland that what the president really wants from the new Ukrainian leadership is a commitment to investigate his political opponents, the Bidens, and a conspiracy theory about Democratic and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and that to secure a visit to the White House, a visit that the Ukrainians badly want, will be contingent upon them publicly committing to conducting those investigations. As the summer goes on, he learns in July that, inexplicably and despite the guidance of the Defense Department and the State Department, the president has ordered the Office of Management and Budget to freeze the $400 million in security aid that is meant to be delivered to the Ukrainians. Taylor is completely alarmed by this. Remember, Taylor really knows the threat to Ukraine well, and he understands the power that this money has to help prop up its military. But what he doesn’t understand is why, at first, the money is being held up. And he describes, shortly after hearing that it’s going to be withheld, traveling to the northern border of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are coming into contact with mounting hostile Russian-led forces, and thinking to himself, “I know this aid is being withheld, and these guys don’t.” And this is the face of the threat. More Ukrainians are going to die if the United States assistance does not come through.

michael barbaro

Wow.

nicholas fandos

And so he is really shaken by this and describes a series of meetings where he and others are trying to push to get it reinstated. And it’s around this time, Taylor testifies, he got on the phone with Sondland. And Sondland essentially said to him that everything, the White House meeting and the aid, were contingent upon the Ukrainians committing to these investigations. He said Sondland drew an analogy. He said, think of the president like a businessman. And when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that that person pay up before signing the check.” Now, Taylor is completely taken aback by this. In his view, the analogy doesn’t make any sense. Why would the Ukrainians owe President Trump anything?

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

The security systems had been allocated. And its delivery made sense not just for the Ukrainians, but for the United States’s strategic interest. So this is a kind of key seam that, to him, exposes that to President Trump and those who are enabling him in this effort, it’s not about America’s national security. It’s just about these investigations. And that is what the president is after. That’s the sole goal of his foreign policy here, of this second channel that broke off from the first and seems to be, at this point, more or less the one that matters to the White House.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Nick, how do you find out about all this testimony on Tuesday?

nicholas fandos

So Tuesday was another long day outside of the House Intelligence Committee SCIF. But it was a little unusual in that not long after the testimony began, Democrats began to come out —

archived recording (eric swalwell) I’m not going to comment on what he said inside there.

nicholas fandos

— and, without giving specifics, essentially say on the record —

nicholas fandos

This is a pretty remarkable thing we’ve just heard.

archived recording (ted lieu) And his opening statement is devastating to Donald Trump.

nicholas fandos

This may be the most significant testimony yet.

archived recording (ted lieu) It was very damning for the president.

nicholas fandos

And they all walk out with copies of his 15-page opening statement in their hands, but none of them will give it up to the press. So you know, I basically spent hours running around, working the phones, trying to get my hands on this piece of paper. And only by the early afternoon was I able to get a copy and start reading it and making sense of it.

michael barbaro

And Nick, is a lot of what these Democrats are so excited about, outside this secure room where you’re waiting on Tuesday, is that now the money, the military aid, is back in the picture? It’s now showing up in these hearings after a week where it had not been present.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right. I mean, what they got with Bill Taylor today was somebody who had been there, had had a front seat to this whole story, come in and say, yeah, this thing in the middle, the military aid, the kind of — the worst possible thing in all of these allegations, that happened. That was true, and here’s why that matters. Democrats will tell you that any quid pro quo in this case is inappropriate. Even withholding a White House meeting is inappropriate and potentially impeachable from their point of view. But it’s the security aid, the withholding of a significant chunk of money that Republicans and Democrats both support, that they think is an obvious step for the United States to take for its own interests and to help its allies in Europe. That that would be withheld is, in political terms, kind of another magnitude of significance. And it’s the thing that Democrats think Republicans and, frankly, voters around the country are more likely to be convinced by. That hundreds of millions of dollars in hard military aid to fight a conflict against the Russians just resonates more with people. That’s a bigger kind of thing to be messing around with than a meeting at the White House, which most people don’t know why a meeting gets scheduled or doesn’t get scheduled. So by reinserting the military aid into the center of this, it reopens the possibility that this case could become more than a partisan exercise.

michael barbaro

But Nick, as you said, the whole impeachment inquiry began with a phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, in which military aid appeared to be withheld in exchange for these investigations that Trump wants. What’s different about what happened on Tuesday that makes it such a big deal?

nicholas fandos

So what we had before was an anonymous allegation from a whistle-blower whose information didn’t seem to be firsthand. And in any case, the public doesn’t know who that whistle-blower is. They can’t evaluate that person’s claims. What we had on Tuesday was the top American diplomat in Ukraine, the guy who was supposed to be managing the relationship between the two countries, coming forward and testifying on the record, before Congress, that he saw a quid pro quo, that he saw the aid being withheld to extract political gain for the president of the United States. And he offered an authoritative, detailed and vivid account of how that went down. And that goes a long way. It’s not the whole case, but it goes a long way in establishing for Democrats and for this investigation that what they suspected, what was initially alleged, did, in fact, occur.

michael barbaro

So at this point, what was first an anonymous allegation delivered by a whistle-blower was just very much confirmed by an ambassador under oath, like you just said. So what more evidence do people on the impeachment inquiry committees need, do you think, to vote to impeach the president?

nicholas fandos

So I think what they want is to continue moving towards these kind of inner concentric circles. So if they’ve talked to the ambassador now, next they want to hear from the White House budget office to hear what order exactly came down from President Trump to suspend the aid. What did that sound like? What did people in the office think? What debate happened there? They want to know what was happening in the National Security Council, where advisers and aides to the president were listening to a lot of these calls and interactions in real time, not to mention talking with him, and will have their own accounts as to what was going down. So basically, if Taylor has sketched in this important part of the picture, they’re looking for additional witnesses that are kind of even closer to the action to fill in kind of flourishes and details that will either back up or disprove what he had to say. Because ultimately, what this is really about is about President Trump. You’re not impeaching these other officials around him. The House would vote to impeach President Trump. And they need to be able to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt in the Senate. And so what they’re really after is as precise and vivid a picture as possible of what President Trump was doing and saying and meaning as he took these actions.

michael barbaro

Right. They want the closest thing possible to direct, irrefutable evidence that the president himself said, withhold this money until I get my investigation. And it sounds like on Tuesday, they got a lot closer to that, but perhaps not all the way.

nicholas fandos

That’s right, and that’s why the investigation will keep grinding on.

He likened the explanations from the White House and its surrogates to the way someone solves the game “Clue,” with its menagerie of possible culprits, weapons and crime scenes.

The show, which is airing on a half dozen stations in Virginia and Florida and streams on the website WarRoom.org, is a remarkably blunt attempt by former Trump aides to criticize and influence the work of current Trump administration officials. Even the show’s name is something of an affront to the White House — and to Mr. Trump himself. He has told aides that he does not want to create a war room, as crisis response operations are often nicknamed, because he is concerned that people would see it as an acknowledgment that he views the impeachment inquiry as legitimate.

Though many in the White House may be tempted to dismiss the show as a bootleg operation run by people cut off from Mr. Trump’s inner circle, Mr. Miller said in an interview that the president ultimately cares about one thing when it comes to managing a crisis of this magnitude: “Are there people defending me or not?”

Mr. Miller added that with the exception of a handful of Trump loyalists, “There is a serious lack of Trump allies jumping out there and defending the president.” Too few Republicans, he said, are questioning the process of the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, which he said was being run in a clandestine fashion from “Schiff’s secret Capitol basement bunker.” It was a reference to the secure hearing room in the Capitol where Representative Adam Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, is presiding over witness interviews.

The idea for the new program came to Mr. Bannon after he appeared last week on the radio show of John Fredericks, a conservative whose daily broadcast airs across Virginia. He was floored by the backlash he got when he stated what he said he assumed was accepted as fact among Republicans and Democrats alike: Mr. Trump is likely to be impeached."

Biden Jr.’s campaign effectively dropped its longstanding opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs on Thursday, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to try and lift him in the Democratic primary.

The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals.

Mr. Biden had explicitly denounced support from a super PAC in his 2020 run and had previously said he would not have blessed one if he had run in 2016. As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort.

But on Thursday, Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, softened that stance, blaming the barrage of ads and attacks from President Trump and his allies and accusing them of interfering in the Democratic primary."

But a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday had Ms. Warren as the front-runner, seven points ahead of Mr. Biden.

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont finished a strong third in both national polls, suggesting that his standing in the race has not been diminished by his heart attack earlier this month — and that he may have been buoyed by endorsements from Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.

Mr. Trump has tried to spin what he did as a good thing. “As the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!” he tweeted on Oct. 3.

Except that, as members of his own administration continue to clarify, this wasn’t a broad effort to root out corruption. It was a targeted campaign to pressure a foreign government to interfere with an American election on Mr. Trump’s behalf — apparently by holding hostage nearly $400 million in military aid.

He and many of his defenders have clung to the idea that there was no “quid pro quo,” a position rebutted on Tuesday by the testimony of William Taylor, the top American diplomat i n Ukraine.

Faced with this jaw-dropping account from the president’s own envoy, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, dismissed it as part of “a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.”

On Wednesday the president went further. He called Mr. Taylor “Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor” in one tweet and declared in another: “The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!”"

A raft of congressional Republicans — including (say it with me) Senator Lindsey Graham — learned that our top diplomat in Ukraine had confirmed the Trump administration’s aid-for-dirt caper, yet still insists the impeachment proceedings are a sham. The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, acknowledged this same quid pro quo in a news conference, only to proclaim later that none of us understands English. Any public servant who dares say that two plus two just might equal four is immediately accused by Trump of radicalism, treason, witch hunting.

Compare that with President Barack Obama’s relationship with those who inconvenienced him. When James Comey, then the head of the F.B.I., made the fateful decision to announce that he’d reopened his inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s emails just days before the 2016 election, Obama could not have been especially pleased. By imperiling Clinton’s chances, Comey was imperiling Obama’s own legacy too. Yet Obama still behaved warmly toward him, according to James Stewart in his new book, “Deep State.” Why? Because “Democrats,” as Jonathan Chait explained in his review of that book, “still believed in institutions and norms.”

This idea — that Democrats still believe in norms, customs, the rather crucial notion of checks and balances, in government itself — may be the crux of the multiverse problem. Look at someone like Joe Biden, whose essential pitch (in addition to experience, incremental change, working-class-guyness) is that he can work with the men and women on the other side of the aisle.

But this suggests that compromise is an option. It doesn’t appear that the other side is much interested. You have Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, holding a Supreme Court appointment hostage for nearly a year, blocking almost all legislative debate and passing a bill to protect the 2020 elections from foreign interference only under extreme duress; the world’s “greatest deliberative body” is now a speedway for the Trump agenda. When they were in charge, you had House Republicans informally observing the Hastert rule— named for the former speaker Dennis Hastert, who was carted off to prison for paying hush money to a former student he’d sexually abused — which says bills can come to the floor only if a majority of the Republicans support them. It virtually ensures minoritarian rule."

Democrats may also decide to call a string of other diplomats and administration officials, including William B. Taylor Jr., th e top American diplomat in Ukraine, who testified in excruciating detail about a quid pro quo in which Mr. Trump and his allies held up security aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden.

Privately, White House officials concede they are losing the messaging battle with Democrats, whose inquiry has produced a series of devastating revelations about allegations that the president and his allies conducted a campaign to pressure Ukraine for his own political gain.

People close to Mr. Trump said that the coming weeks will be marked by an increased assault on the integrity of the inquiry itself as the White House tries to avoid litigating the facts of what took place between Ukrainian officials and Mr. Trump’s loyalists, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer.

White House aides are planning to add communications aides dedicated to impeachment, a move that Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, has pushed for. Among those under consideration to help lead the new team is Tony Sayegh, who recently left the Treasury Department where he was the top spokesman. White House aides have also discussed bringing on in some capacity Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida and a favorite of Mr. Trump’s, a person familiar with the conversations said.

Stephen K. Bannon, who was pushed out as the White House chief strategist in August 2017, has also created an unofficial war room in the basement of his Capitol Hill townhouse to wage over the radio a messaging war on the Democratic impeachment effort.

Mr. Graham said that Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s acting chief of staff, has assured him that the White House is “working on getting a messaging team together” and said he hoped it would be as effective as the one that Bill Clinton’s White House assembled during Mr. Clinton’s impeachment in the late 1990s."

The declaration came in a 75-page opinion by Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington. She ruled that the House Judiciary Committee was entitled to view secret grand jury evidence gathered by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.

Typically, Congress has no right to view such evidence. But in 1974, the courts permitted lawmakers to see such materials as they weighed whether to impeach President Richard M. Nixon. The House is now immersed in the same process focused on Mr. Trump, Judge Howell ruled, and that easily outweighs any need to keep the information secret from lawmakers.

And in a rebuke to the Trump administration, she wrote that the White House strategy to stonewall the House had actually strengthened lawmakers’ case. She cited Mr. Trump’s vow to fight “all” congressional subpoenas and an extraordinary directive by his White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, that executive branch officials should not provide testimony or documents to impeachment investigators."

The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals.

Mr. Biden had explicitly denounced support from a super PAC in his 2020 run and had previously said he would not have blessed one if he had run in 2016. As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort.

Mr. Schultz, the Biden campaign manager, said in an interview on Friday that Mr. Biden was facing a financial situation unlike any other Democrat: He is taking incoming fire from both the White House and primary opponents on a daily basis, and needs to play both offense and defense within the limits of $2,800 maximum donations .

Mr. Biden’s allies are not only concerned about his fund-raising: There’s also the spending . Mr. Biden raised $15.7 million in the third quarter, but he spent $2 million more than that. Among his biggest expenses was more than $920,000 on chartered jets.

Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and a prolific fund-raiser, said that donors were “furious” about the jet spending and called the campaign’s overall money situation “very alarming.” Mr. McAuliffe’s wife recently invited donors to attend a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden at their home in early November.

Mr. Schultz, when asked about the chartered travel, said that “whatever maximizes Joe Biden and voter interaction, the greater chance we have to win.” T he campaign said Mr. Biden had flown commercial but declined to indicate when his last such flight was.

But There’s a Problem.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/us/politics/giuliani-hunter-biden-romania.html,"WASHINGTON — Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, signaled this month that he planned to open a new front in his attacks against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — work done by Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden for a wealthy Romanian business executive facing corruption charges.

But there’s a problem with that strategy: Mr. Giuliani participated in an effort that would have helped the same executive, and was in fact recruited to do so by Louis J. Freeh, a former F.B.I. director who had been brought onto the matter by Hunter Biden.

In effect, Mr. Giuliani and Hunter Biden were on the same team, if not at the same time. And their work to help the business executive, along with that of Mr. Freeh, stood in contrast to efforts by the United States, including Vice President Biden while he was in office, to encourage anti-corruption efforts in Romania.

The dynamic in Romania underscores how Mr. Giuliani has done a brisk international business with clients who sometimes seem to be seeking to capitalize on his connections to Mr. Trump even as he has accused Hunter Biden of seeking to capitalize on his father’s name while doing business in other countries. And the disclosure of the connection between his role in Romania and Mr. Biden’s comes at a time when Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, is under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York for possible violations of foreign lobbying laws."

Other senior White House officials could follow suit.

In a terse letter sent Saturday to Mr. Kupperman’s lawyers, Democrats said the House did not recognize the White House’s legal claims as legitimate. They ordered Mr. Kupperman to testify on Monday or risk adding to evidence that Mr. Trump is obstructing Congress and should be held in contempt.

Mr. Trump continued on Saturday to rail against the inquiry, dismissing it on Twitter as “just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it.” He also claimed that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader who initiated the impeachment inquiry in September, was neglecting her San Francisco district, which he described as a hellscape of environmental and sanitary violations.

Mr. Reeker’s testimony on Saturday was the latest by roughly a dozen witnesses, many of whom were ordered by the administration not to cooperate but confronted with subpoenas complied anyway.

Mr. Reeker took charge of the State Department’s activities in Europe and Eurasia this March, dividing his time between Washington and Europe. A 27-year veteran of the foreign service, he had been posted around the world, including in Iraq, Germany, Italy, Hungary and Macedonia. Friends described him as a consummate diplomat, who, as one put it, “never says any word more or any word less than he should.”

Mr. Reeker testified that it was immediately clear to him that President Trump had been relying on two other officials to carry out his policy toward Ukraine: Gordon D. Sondland, a Republican fund-raiser who had been named ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine. Mr. Sondland was one of seven ambassadors who reported to Mr. Reeker.

Mr. Reeker also testified that he understood that Ms. Yovanovitch, the ambassador in Kiev and a longtime colleague, was under attack by Mr. Giuliani and his allies. Among their accusations, the ambassador’s critics claimed that she was disloyal to the president — charges that Mr. Reeker considered completely spurious."

It’s that he’s surrounded by occluders and toadies, nihilist tricksters spun directly from the looms of the Marx Brothers’ imagination. (“Who you gonna believe? Me or your own eyes?”)

A raft of congressional Republicans — including (say it with me) Senator Lindsey Graham — learned that our top diplomat in Ukraine had confirmed the Trump administration’s aid-for-dirt caper, yet still insists the impeachment proceedings are a sham. The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, acknowledged this same quid pro quo in a news conference, only to proclaim later that none of us understands English. Any public servant who dares say that two plus two just might equal four is immediately accused by Trump of radicalism, treason, witch hunting.

Compare that with President Barack Obama’s relationship with those who inconvenienced him. When James Comey, then the head of the F.B.I., made the fateful decision to announce that he’d reopened his inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s emails just days before the 2016 election, Obama could not have been especially pleased. By imperiling Clinton’s chances, Comey was imperiling Obama’s own legacy too. Yet Obama still behaved warmly toward him, according to James Stewart in his new book, “Deep State.” Why? Because “Democrats,” as Jonathan Chait explained in his review of that book, “still believed in institutions and norms.”

This idea — that Democrats still believe in norms, customs, the rather crucial notion of checks and balances, in government itself — may be the crux of the multiverse problem. Look at someone like Joe Biden, whose essential pitch (in addition to experience, incremental change, working-class-guyness) is that he can work with the men and women on the other side of the aisle.

But this suggests that compromise is an option. It doesn’t appear that the other side is much interested. You have Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, holding a Supreme Court appointment hostage for nearly a year, blocking almost all legislative debate and passing a bill to protect the 2020 elections from foreign interference only under extreme duress; the world’s “greatest deliberative body” is now a speedway for the Trump agenda. When they were in charge, you had House Republicans informally observing the Hastert rule— named for the former speaker Dennis Hastert, who was carted off to prison for paying hush money to a former student he’d sexually abused — which says bills can come to the floor only if a majority of the Republicans support them. It virtually ensures minoritarian rule."

She went on to become a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF, spending time in Angola, India and Kosovo. She campaigned for Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts during his 2004 presidential run and was among the chorus of celebrities to speak out against President George W. Bush. She has talked openly about her anxiety disorder, revealed on her podcast that she had two abortions in her 20s and might say she’s not above using her celebrity for the good of a cause — once leaking a “sex tape” of herself that was actually a video about the bloodshed in Syria.

“There could be a new cause tonight,” joked her husband of a decade, the talent agent David Bugliari.

She says that’s exactly right — she is “multi-issue focused,” particularly right now, when there’s “so much to fight for.”

But it was #MeToo that galvanized her. Lying in bed late one night, about a week after the revelations about Harvey Weinstein hit, she was encouraged by a friend — the transgender activist Charlotte Clymer — to send a tweet: “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.”

“I closed my computer, went to sleep, and woke up to 35,000 replies,” Ms. Milano said .

The rest of the story we now know: The hashtag went viral. Terms like “reckoning” were used by the media to describe the cultural ricochet. Tarana Burke, the activist who founded the MeToo movement in 2006, and Ms. Milano soon met — the actress did not know about Ms. Burke’s work at the time of her tweet — and were named, alongside other influencers, Time’s person of the year (dubbed “The Silence Breakers”).

Bush. “I cannot see how any responsible investigation would not seek Bolton’s appearance.”

But he added that the White House would presumably “go to the mat” to fight any effort to interview Mr. Bolton. “If the White House were to fight the House impeachment on executive privilege grounds, Bolton would be the hill on which to die,” Mr. Yoo said. “The Trump White House could claim not just that the impeachment investigation is illegitimate, which is its current line of defense, but that it is defending the right of future presidents to have an effective White House and to conduct a successful foreign policy.”

A Yale-trained lawyer, Mr. Bolton brought years of experience when Mr. Trump made him his third national security adviser in March 2018. Mr. Bolton served in both the Justice Department, where he headed the civil division under President Ronald Reagan, and the State Department, where he was an assistant secretary of state under the first President George Bush and an under secretary of state and ambassador to the United Nations under the second Mr. Bush.

While Mr. Trump appreciated his firebrand style of politics on Fox News, Mr. Bolton saw his job as keeping Mr. Trump from making unwise deals with outlier states like North Korea or Iran, leading to friction. Mr. Bolton struggled with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for control of foreign policy and left just a day before Mr. Trump agreed to restore the frozen aid to Ukraine under pressure from Congress.

With his trademark bushy mustache and unapologetic conservative views, Mr. Bolton, 70, has built a following on the right, even flirting in the past with running for president himself. His political action committee has donated more than $1.5 million to candidates since 2014 and spent another $6 million to promote his policy views related to national security.

Since leaving Mr. Trump’s team last month, Mr. Bolton has already identified five Republican senators and congressmen for whom he plans to raise $50,000 each and, as reported by Bloomberg, sent out the solicitation email on Thursday that seemed to provide conflicting clues. He has also rejoined the Rhone Group, a private equity firm where he worked before the White House, and was spotted in South Korea in recent days talking with investors.

But There’s a Problem.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/us/politics/giuliani-hunter-biden-romania.html,"WASHINGTON — Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, signaled this month that he planned to open a new front in his attacks against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — work done by Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden for a wealthy Romanian business executive facing corruption charges.

But there’s a problem with that strategy: Mr. Giuliani participated in an effort that would have helped the same executive, and was in fact recruited to do so by Louis J. Freeh, a former F.B.I. director who had been brought onto the matter by Hunter Biden.

In effect, Mr. Giuliani and Hunter Biden were on the same team, if not at the same time. And their work to help the business executive, along with that of Mr. Freeh, stood in contrast to efforts by the United States, including Vice President Biden while he was in office, to encourage anti-corruption efforts in Romania.

The dynamic in Romania underscores how Mr. Giuliani has done a brisk international business with clients who sometimes seem to be seeking to capitalize on his connections to Mr. Trump even as he has accused Hunter Biden of seeking to capitalize on his father’s name while doing business in other countries. And the disclosure of the connection between his role in Romania and Mr. Biden’s comes at a time when Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, is under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York for possible violations of foreign lobbying laws."

Other senior White House officials could follow suit.

In a terse letter sent Saturday to Mr. Kupperman’s lawyers, Democrats said the House did not recognize the White House’s legal claims as legitimate. They ordered Mr. Kupperman to testify on Monday or risk adding to evidence that Mr. Trump is obstructing Congress and should be held in contempt.

Mr. Trump continued on Saturday to rail against the inquiry, dismissing it on Twitter as “just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it.” He also claimed that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader who initiated the impeachment inquiry in September, was neglecting her San Francisco district, which he described as a hellscape of environmental and sanitary violations.

Mr. Reeker’s testimony on Saturday was the latest by roughly a dozen witnesses, many of whom were ordered by the administration not to cooperate but confronted with subpoenas complied anyway.

Mr. Reeker took charge of the State Department’s activities in Europe and Eurasia this March, dividing his time between Washington and Europe. A 27-year veteran of the foreign service, he had been posted around the world, including in Iraq, Germany, Italy, Hungary and Macedonia. Friends described him as a consummate diplomat, who, as one put it, “never says any word more or any word less than he should.”

Mr. Reeker testified that it was immediately clear to him that President Trump had been relying on two other officials to carry out his policy toward Ukraine: Gordon D. Sondland, a Republican fund-raiser who had been named ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine. Mr. Sondland was one of seven ambassadors who reported to Mr. Reeker.

Mr. Reeker also testified that he understood that Ms. Yovanovitch, the ambassador in Kiev and a longtime colleague, was under attack by Mr. Giuliani and his allies. Among their accusations, the ambassador’s critics claimed that she was disloyal to the president — charges that Mr. Reeker considered completely spurious."

Bush. “I cannot see how any responsible investigation would not seek Bolton’s appearance.”

But he added that the White House would presumably “go to the mat” to fight any effort to interview Mr. Bolton. “If the White House were to fight the House impeachment on executive privilege grounds, Bolton would be the hill on which to die,” Mr. Yoo said. “The Trump White House could claim not just that the impeachment investigation is illegitimate, which is its current line of defense, but that it is defending the right of future presidents to have an effective White House and to conduct a successful foreign policy.”

A Yale-trained lawyer, Mr. Bolton brought years of experience when Mr. Trump made him his third national security adviser in March 2018. Mr. Bolton served in both the Justice Department, where he headed the civil division under President Ronald Reagan, and the State Department, where he was an assistant secretary of state under the first President George Bush and an under secretary of state and ambassador to the United Nations under the second Mr. Bush.

While Mr. Trump appreciated his firebrand style of politics on Fox News, Mr. Bolton saw his job as keeping Mr. Trump from making unwise deals with outlier states like North Korea or Iran, leading to friction. Mr. Bolton struggled with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for control of foreign policy and left just a day before Mr. Trump agreed to restore the frozen aid to Ukraine under pressure from Congress.

With his trademark bushy mustache and unapologetic conservative views, Mr. Bolton, 70, has built a following on the right, even flirting in the past with running for president himself. His political action committee has donated more than $1.5 million to candidates since 2014 and spent another $6 million to promote his policy views related to national security.

Since leaving Mr. Trump’s team last month, Mr. Bolton has already identified five Republican senators and congressmen for whom he plans to raise $50,000 each and, as reported by Bloomberg, sent out the solicitation email on Thursday that seemed to provide conflicting clues. He has also rejoined the Rhone Group, a private equity firm where he worked before the White House, and was spotted in South Korea in recent days talking with investors. And he is reportedly thinking about writing a book."

My children are not going to sit in on cabinet meetings,” Mr. Biden said.

“It’s just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you’re doing is for them,” Mr. Biden said. “And the idea that you’re going to have his children, his son-in-law, et cetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.”

The president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, should not be negotiating Middle East peace, Mr. Biden said. “What credentials does he bring to that?”

With little more than three months until the first caucus, in Iowa, most national public polls show Mr. Biden leading his top opponents, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, although one poll recently placed Ms. Warren at the head of the pack.

Asked whether he was worried that his opponents were exciting young voters by offering dramatic change, Mr. Biden said that while he wants young people engaged , older voters — a demographic in which Mr. Biden has considerable support — will ultimately control the outcome of the nomination ra ce.

“Overwhelmingly, people over the age of 50 vote in these primaries,” Mr. Biden said. He also took aim at his rivals for what he called far-reaching assertions."

For now, Democrats have not yet exhausted testimony from officials who appear willing to cooperate and have at least peripheral knowledge of the case.

Other officials from the State and Defense Departments involved in Ukraine policy are set to appear, as well.

Democrats believe a reconstructed transcript released by the White House of a July phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine also significantly bolsters their case. In the call, Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and unproven theories about Democratic collusion with Ukraine during the 2016 election.

“We have a tremendous table of evidence before us that fills in all of the principal, material questions that were raised by the whistle-blower,” said Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, referring to an anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower whose complaint about Mr. Trump’s actions toward Ukraine helped prompt the impeachment inquiry."

Bernie Sanders put it in starker terms, saying the United States should demand more from Israel.

But whatever the language, one thing was clear: Democratic attitudes toward Israel are shifting in the highest echelons of the party.

Several Democratic presidential hopefuls spoke at a national conference hosted by J Street, a liberal lobbying group that describes itself as “pro-Israel and pro-peace.” Thousands of progressive Jewish activists gathered at the two-day conference, as candidates answered questions about what they would do to end the Israeli occupation in the West Bank as well as restart negotiations between Palestinians and the Israeli government. Such negotiations have long been at a standstill.

But the questions went beyond what is known as the two-state solution, which would grant Palestinians statehood — an idea that many see as far-fetched or impossible under the Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu administrations."

Meanwhile, in a parallel effort that appears designed to undermine the integrity of the Mueller report, Attorney General Bill Barr recently traveled to Italy (at least twice) and Britain to gather information as part of his review of the origins of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

But there is yet another, perhaps more unnerving effect of these efforts by Trump affiliates like Rudy Giuliani to generate dirt on the Biden family and to taint the findings of the Mueller investigation: It is providing immense tinder for the pyre of propaganda that the Russian intelligence services may ignite for the 2020 election.

Wittingly or unwittingly, the president and his allies are helping to propagate another disinformation campaign — one that will most likely aid Russia, yet again, in its efforts to intervene corruptly in the American electoral process.

This state of affairs was laid bare in the explosive congressional testimony last week of William Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, who described the operation of two diplomatic channels there — one normal and proper, Mr. Taylor said, the second “highly irregular.” The second channel, led by Rudy Giuliani and some State Department officials, involved holding arms shipments to Ukraine hostage to demands that the Ukrainian president “go to a microphone” and announce investigations into the Biden family and Ukraine’s role in the 2016 presidential election."

But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men.

Candidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders — former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will qualify.

With the Iowa caucuses three months away, it’s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership — not to mention the affected candidates.

“I’ve had lots of crazy things said to me, like, ‘Is America ready for another black president?’” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in an interview. “And I’m confident it’s never been asked of a white candidate, ‘Is America ready for another white president?’”"

A Ukrainian Refugee Who Rose to the White House,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/politics/alexander-vindman-impeachment.html,"It was one of the more memorable turns in an inquiry that has been full of them. Colonel Vindman, who is fluent in Ukrainian, was the first White House official to testify who listened in on a July 25 call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. With his long résumé and military credentials, he immediately became a problem for Republicans.

Mr. Trump assailed him on Twitter, though not by name, branding him a “Never Trumper” without evidence. Conservative pundits and allies of the president questioned the colonel’s loyalty, insinuating he might be a spy for the country of his birth. But House Republicans, perhaps fearing a backlash, took pains to defend Colonel Vindman’s honor — even as they insisted he was wrong about Mr. Trump.

“He’s a veteran, a combat veteran and he needs our respect and appreciation,” said Representative Tim Burchett, a freshman Republican from Tennessee who participated in Tuesday’s closed-door hearing, echoing the statements of leadership. “But he also needs to be questioned.”

Inside the secure room, known as a SCIF, the atmosphere grew tense, as Republicans questioned Colonel Vindman about his private conversations in what Democrats viewed as an effort to discern the identity of the whistle-blower who prompted the inquiry. The colonel pushed back, participants said, making clear he was unwilling to share such information, especially when it involved members of the intelligence community.

But beyond the substance and the drama, Colonel Vindman offered a compelling immigrants’ tale and a glimpse into the story of twin brothers who have lived a singular American experience, one that was featured in a Ken Burns documentary when they were children. From their days as little boys in matching short pants and blue caps, toddling around the Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn — known as Little Odessa for its population of refugees from the former Soviet Union — and into adulthood, they have followed strikingly similar paths."

Referring to his sexual orientation and his marriage to another man, he told me, “It’s safe to say that it led to there being more interest and attention early on.” He stood out among the dozens of Democratic aspirants, each desperate to do precisely that.

But there’s a big difference between winning over enough Americans to land in his current position — he placed second, behind Elizabeth Warren, in one survey of Iowa voters last week — and having an appeal broad enough to nab the party’s nomination, let alone the White House. Is being gay an insurmountable obstacle on the path to those prizes?

Anyone who answers with an unequivocal yes or no is just guessing.

The question is now being asked more urgently than before, as the primary contests draw closer and many Democrats simultaneously assess the risks of the two front-runners, Warren and Joe Biden, and survey the field anew, wondering if anyone in the tier of candidates just below them might be a better opponent for Donald Trump. Their gazes invariably fall on Buttigieg, but their apprehensions include whether America could really elect a gay president."

It’s hard to find good news regarding our politics. Yet seeing Sherrod Brown’s name in this article is heartening. It’s not that the Democrats don’t have good-to-great candidates. They do. But each is flawed enough to risk giving this country another four years with President Trump.

Senator Brown, from Ohio, is uniquely positioned — smart, compassionate, Midwestern, union-friendly, reasonable about supporting a public option as opposed to “Medicare for all” — to ensure a win. What can we do to entice him to jump in now?

Several Democratic presidential hopefuls spoke at a national conference hosted by J Street, a liberal lobbying group that describes itself as “pro-Israel and pro-peace.” Thousands of progressive Jewish activists gathered at the two-day conference, as candidates answered questions about what they would do to end the Israeli occupation in the West Bank as well as restart negotiations between Palestinians and the Israeli government. Such negotiations have long been at a standstill.

Mr. Trump assailed him on Twitter, though not by name, branding him a “Never Trumper” without evidence. Conservative pundits and allies of the president questioned the colonel’s loyalty, insinuating he might be a spy for the country of his birth.

Meanwhile, in a parallel effort that appears designed to undermine the integrity of the Mueller report, Attorney General Bill Barr recently traveled to Italy (at least twice) and Britain to gather information as part of his review of the origins of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

But there is yet another, perhaps more unnerving effect of these efforts by Trump affiliates like Rudy Giuliani to generate dirt on the Biden family and to taint the findings of the Mueller investigation: It is providing immense tinder for the pyre of propaganda that the Russian intelligence services may ignite for the 2020 election.

Wittingly or unwittingly, the president and his allies are helping to propagate another disinformation campaign — one that will most likely aid Russia, yet again, in its efforts to intervene corruptly in the American electoral process.

This state of affairs was laid bare in the explosive congressional testimony last week of William Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, who described the operation of two diplomatic channels there — one normal and proper, Mr. Taylor said, the second “highly irregular.” The second channel, led by Rudy Giuliani and some State Department officials, involved holding arms shipments to Ukraine hostage to demands that the Ukrainian president “go to a microphone” and announce investigations into the Biden family and Ukraine’s role in the 2016 presidential election."

Mr. Obama did not take a seat at the table as he watched a live feed of the raid from a crewless drone overhead. Instead, he was seated off to the side, next to Brig. Gen. Marshall B. Webb , assistant commanding general of Joint Special Operations Command, who was overseeing the communications for the operation.

Also seated around the table: Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. , without a tie; Denis McDonough , who was deputy national security adviser at the time, and also tieless; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , with a hand covering her mouth in a gesture of apparent awe at what she was witnessing (at the time she said she was covering her mouth to cough, but later said it was a gasp); and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , with a tie but no jacket. Seven other national security officials, including Tom Donilon , the national security adviser (sans tie), filled the space behind the chairs to standing-room-only capacity.

The tension in the photograph is the scene of the nation’s top national security officials so absorbed in action taking place halfway across the globe that no one in the room seems aware of the presence of a photographer documenting the moment, or where they were positioned in relation to the president.

Mr. Trump, in contrast, is seated at the head of the table in the Situation Room’s main conference room, positioned at the center of the action with a smaller circle of aides fanning out around him.

On one side of Mr. Trump is Vice President Mike Pence. On the other is Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper . The other officials are: Robert C. O’Brien , the national security adviser; Gen. Mark A. Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Brig. Gen. Marcus Evans , deputy director for special operations on the Joint Staff, whose face is obscured.

Mr. Obama’s understated position in the photograph makes him look like a White House staffer, not the man who ordered the raid the night before. Mr. Trump looks like a chief executive posing for a photograph in which his role is central to the story itself.

Six months into his presidential campaign , Mr. Biden is still delivering uneven performances on the debate stage and on the campaign trail in ways that can undermine his message. He takes circuitous routes to the ends of sentences, if he finishes them at all. He sometimes says the opposite of what he means (“I would eliminate the capital gains tax — I would raise the capital gains tax” he said in this month’s debate). He has mixed up countries, cities and dates, embarked on off-message asides and sometimes he simply cuts himself off .

That choppy speaking style puts Mr. Biden at a disadvantage as his front-runner status erodes and he confronts growing pressure to expand his appeal with voters and donors. He faces intensifying competition for moderate support, a formidable liberal foe in Elizabeth Warren, attacks on his family by Mr. Trump and Republicans, and a troubling cash crunch.

At a time when he most needs to convey confidence and forcefulness, some Democrats say, he is instead getting in his own way.

“He does not do well speaking where he isn’t giving a speech,” said Chris Henning, the Democratic chair in Greene County, Iowa, who caucused for Mr. Biden when he ran for president in 2008. “He’s not good in debates and he comes across like he’s stumbling around, trying to figure out what he’s going to say.”"

But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men.

Candidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders — former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will qualify.

With the Iowa caucuses three months away, it’s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership — not to mention the affected candidates.

The moves are the most serious reboot from any Democratic campaign that was once in the top tier, but they may not be enough to ensure a turnaround for Ms. Harris. Even as she commits to campaigning aggressively in Iowa, she is keeping up a busy national fund-raising schedule to avoid falling further behind financially; in July, August and September, Ms. Harris spent nearly $1.25 for every dollar she raised.

The restructuring came on the same day that a new poll, from USA Today/Suffolk, showed Ms. Harris dropping to 3 percent, down three percentage points since August.

He’d be the first to acknowledge that. In fact he did acknowledge it when we spoke last June about the state of L.G.B.T.Q. rights in America. Referring to his sexual orientation and his marriage to another man, he told me, “It’s safe to say that it led to there being more interest and attention early on.” He stood out among the dozens of Democratic aspirants, each desperate to do precisely that.

But there’s a big difference between winning over enough Americans to land in his current position — he placed second, behind Elizabeth Warren, in one survey of Iowa voters last week — and having an appeal broad enough to nab the party’s nomination, let alone the White House. Is being gay an insurmountable obstacle on the path to those prizes?

Anyone who answers with an unequivocal yes or no is just guessing.

The question is now being asked more urgently than before, as the primary contests draw closer and many Democrats simultaneously assess the risks of the two front-runners, Warren and Joe Biden, and survey the field anew, wondering if anyone in the tier of candidates just below them might be a better opponent for Donald Trump.

Re “Anxious Democrats Ask, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’” (news article, Oct. 23):

It’s hard to find good news regarding our politics. Yet seeing Sherrod Brown’s name in this article is heartening. It’s not that the Democrats don’t have good-to-great candidates. They do. But each is flawed enough to risk giving this country another four years with President Trump.

Senator Brown, from Ohio, is uniquely positioned — smart, compassionate, Midwestern, union-friendly, reasonable about supporting a public option as opposed to “Medicare for all” — to ensure a win. What can we do to entice him to jump in now?

There is still plenty of time for former Vice President Al Gore to run for president. He has integrity, experience and great name recognition, and he was ahead of most in recognizing the urgency of addressing man-made climate change. Perhaps most important, he is the only candidate who has won a presidential election — though five Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices took away his victory.

When will the Democratic National Committee listen to its base? Instead of celebrating the most diverse and progressive group ever, big donors and top Democratic Party leaders keep searching. The polls show that all three leading candidates — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden — can beat President Trump, so that’s not their real worry."

A Ukrainian Refugee Who Rose to the White House - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/politics/who-is-alexander-vindman.html,"It was one of the more memorable turns in an inquiry that has been full of them. Colonel Vindman, who is fluent in Ukrainian, was the first White House official to testify who listened in on a July 25 call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. With his long résumé and military credentials, he immediately became a problem for Republicans.

Mr. Trump assailed him on Twitter, though not by name, branding him a “Never Trumper” without evidence. Conservative pundits and allies of the president questioned the colonel’s loyalty, insinuating he might be a spy for the country of his birth. But House Republicans, perhaps fearing a backlash, took pains to defend Colonel Vindman’s honor — even as they insisted he was wrong about Mr. Trump.

“He’s a veteran, a combat veteran and he needs our respect and appreciation,” said Representative Tim Burchett, a freshman Republican from Tennessee who participated in Tuesday’s closed-door hearing, echoing the statements of leadership. “But he also needs to be questioned.”

Inside the secure room, known as a SCIF, the atmosphere grew tense, as Republicans questioned Colonel Vindman about his private conversations in what Democrats viewed as an effort to discern the identity of the whistle-blower who prompted the inquiry. The colonel pushed back, participants said, making clear he was unwilling to share such information, especially when it involved members of the intelligence community.

But beyond the substance and the drama, Colonel Vindman offered a compelling immigrants’ tale and a glimpse into the story of twin brothers who have lived a singular American experience, one that was featured in a Ken Burns documentary when they were children. From their days as little boys in matching short pants and blue caps, toddling around the Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn — known as Little Odessa for its population of refugees from the former Soviet Union — and into adulthood, they have followed strikingly similar paths."

Mr. Obama did not take a seat at the table as he watched a live feed of the raid from a crewless drone overhead. Instead, he was seated off to the side, next to Brig. Gen. Marshall B. Webb , assistant commanding general of Joint Special Operations Command, who was overseeing the communications for the operation.

Also seated around the table: Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. , without a tie; Denis McDonough , who was deputy national security adviser at the time, and also tieless; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , with a hand covering her mouth in a gesture of apparent awe at what she was witnessing (at the time she said she was covering her mouth to cough, but later said it was a gasp); and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , with a tie but no jacket. Seven other national security officials, including Tom Donilon , the national security adviser (sans tie), filled the space behind the chairs to standing-room-only capacity.

The tension in the photograph is the scene of the nation’s top national security officials so absorbed in action taking place halfway across the globe that no one in the room seems aware of the presence of a photographer documenting the moment, or where they were positioned in relation to the president.

Mr. Trump, in contrast, is seated at the head of the table in the Situation Room’s main conference room, positioned at the center of the action with a smaller circle of aides fanning out around him.

On one side of Mr. Trump is Vice President Mike Pence. On the other is Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper . The other officials are: Robert C. O’Brien , the national security adviser; Gen. Mark A. Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Brig. Gen. Marcus Evans , deputy director for special operations on the Joint Staff, whose face is obscured.

Mr. Obama’s understated position in the photograph makes him look like a White House staffer, not the man who ordered the raid the night before. Mr. Trump looks like a chief executive posing for a photograph in which his role is central to the story itself.

Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, after the envoy pressed Ukrainian officials to help the Trump administration by investigating the Biden family. The colonel said he acted out of a “sense of duty,” and emphasized his military service in his remarks. “I am a patriot,” he said, “and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics.”

As he spoke, House leaders were preparing for what was expected to be significant new private testimony from current and former White House officials in the coming days. On Wednesday, they will hear from two Ukraine experts who advised Kurt D. Volker, the former United States special envoy to the country. On Thursday, Timothy Morrison, the National Security Council’s Russia and Europe director, is scheduled to testify. And on Friday, investigators have called Robert Blair, a top national security adviser to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff.

There is no recording of the July 25 call by the American side. The White House uses note-takers listening in on the call as well as voice recognition software to create a rough transcript that is a close approximation of the call. But names and technical terms are frequently missed by the software, according to people familiar with the matter.

After the call, Colonel Vindman was given a hard copy of the rough transcript to make updates and corrections, according to a person familiar with the matter. Colonel Vindman went through the transcript, made changes and gave his written edits to his boss, Mr. Morrison, according to the person.

But after the call, Colonel Vindman went with his brother, a lawyer on the National Security Council staff, to see John A. Eisenberg, the council’s legal adviser, to raise his concerns about the conversation.

Colonel Vindman declined to detail to investigators his discussions with Mr. Eisenberg, citing attorney-client privilege, according to two of the people familiar with the testimony.

One explanation for why Colonel Vindman’s changes were not made could be that the transcript had been quickly placed into a highly secure computer system, the N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment, or NICE system, making it more difficult to alter."
