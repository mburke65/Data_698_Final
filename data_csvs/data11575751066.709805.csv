Goldman met Representative Adam B. Schiff in a classic Washington way: They struck up a conversation in the green room at MSNBC.

The men, both Democrats, had plenty to talk about. Both former federal prosecutors, Mr. Schiff had a deep interest in Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, while Mr. Goldman had investigated Russian organized crime. He told Mr. Schiff to call him if he could be of use. When Democrats won the House and Mr. Schiff became chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he did, inviting Mr. Goldman to join his staff as the chief investigator.

Now Mr. Goldman is the lead author of a report, a draft of which committee members were able to review in private starting Monday evening, that forms the backbone of Democrats’ case for impeaching Mr. Trump. He is one of two unelected officials — the other is Stephen R. Castor, his Republican counterpart, who compiled the dissenting views — who have taken a crucial and unusually public job in the debate over the future of Mr. Trump’s presidency, and the nation.

The pair achieved a measure of Washington stardom over two weeks last month as they grilled witnesses during nationally televised public hearings. The House Judiciary Committee this week begins public hearings to consider articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, meaning Mr. Goldman will probably take the spotlight again to present the Democrats’ case that the president abused his power by trying to enlist Ukraine to dig up damaging information on his political rivals, and it will fall to Mr. Castor to counter it."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The House Intelligence Committee has released its impeachment report to the Judiciary Committee, signaling the end of one phase of impeachment and the beginning of another. Julie Davis on why those two phases will look so different. It’s Wednesday, December 4. Julie, tell me about these two phases of the House impeachment inquiry.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the House Intelligence Committee has just finished its report and completed its work, and now the House Judiciary Committee has its job to do. And these are two very different committees. The House Intelligence Committee is a very buttoned-up, frequently less partisan place. They deal in matters of intelligence. They oversee the intelligence community. They deal in state secrets, and because of that —

archived recording (mike rogers) Committee has been extensively briefed on these efforts over a regular basis as a part of our ongoing oversight responsibility.

julie hirschfeld davis

— it attracts the workhorse members who are into dealing with long reports, really meaty, substantive issues, oftentimes behind closed doors, not in front of the news cameras.

archived recording (mike rogers) Ranking member and I believe it is important to hold an open hearing today, and we don’t do a tremendous amount of those.

julie hirschfeld davis

Dilatory tactics, parliamentary stunts — that sort of thing just doesn’t happen that often in the Intelligence Committee, because that’s just not what they’re about.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) The Judiciary Committee will come to order, and without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.

julie hirschfeld davis

The Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is kind of known for that. And the Judiciary Committee oversees the federal courts and the Justice Department, but it also has jurisdiction over cultural hot button issues.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) We welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on “Planned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s Largest Abortion Provider.”

julie hirschfeld davis

It has jurisdiction over questions of abortion rights, over gun rights —

archived recording (lucy mcbath) I ask my colleagues on this committee, both Republicans and Democrats, to stand up with me in supporting this legislation. We have to save lives.

julie hirschfeld davis

— some of the things that typically draw the most fervent responses from both parties. And so it attracts members who want to engage in that level of really partisan debate — people who really seek out the spotlight, who want to engage in culture war type of subjects that come before the Judiciary Committee, they sort of excel in these very highly partisan public debates. These debates that happen in the Judiciary Committee are typically much more raucous, much more freewheeling, and it’s a much more partisan place.

michael barbaro

So crude summary here. The Intelligence Committee is dominated by rule-oriented leaders, the workhorses. The Judiciary Committee is more dominated by cultural warriors, the show horses.

julie hirschfeld davis

That’s right. And to be clear, there is some overlap between the two committees. There are people who serve on both committees. And it’s not like everyone on the Judiciary Committee is guns blazing, culture warrior, and everyone on the Intelligence Committee is a dry consumer of long intelligence reports.

michael barbaro

[CHUCKLES]

julie hirschfeld davis

But that is the profile of these two committees, and those tend to be the sorts of people who seek out seats on the Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, so there is kind of a cultural difference there.

michael barbaro

So explain how these different roles of these two committees are actually playing out in this impeachment inquiry. Let’s start with the Intelligence Committee, since its work has just been completed. How has its broader role, its rules and its mission reflected in the work of the impeachment inquiry over the past few weeks?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Intelligence Committee is used to working in secret, working in a setting where you’re controlling the flow of information. Because by definition, they’re dealing with intelligence matters, and that can’t be debated freely on the House floor in the halls. And its procedures also reflect that. There is less opportunity for the minority party to shut down the proceedings, because if they were allowed to do that, that could be dangerous. I mean, that has actual implications, potentially, for national security. So the very rules of the committee they’re used to operating under are just tighter by definition. And you saw Adam Schiff, the chairman of the committee, really using that to his advantage when it came to controlling the witness list, having a say in who Republicans would be able to call as public witnesses.

michael barbaro

Right.

julie hirschfeld davis

So Republicans, for instance, wanted to call Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, which — Democrats knew that that would be a red herring. And so they did not sign off on calling Hunter Biden. They did allow Republicans to call some witnesses. We saw them call Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, who was a former National Security Council official. So they didn’t shut them down altogether, but again, the committee operates in this way where the rights of the minority are proscribed such that they can’t just do anything they want whenever they want.

michael barbaro

And what about the witnesses who the Democrats wanted to call? How did they use the Intelligence Committee’s rules to their advantage?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, they were very careful to design a process where the lawyers for each side would be doing, or could be doing, the bulk of the questioning. So that was a concerted move on the part of Adam Schiff, the chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) We’ll now move to the 45-minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes.

julie hirschfeld davis

— to have long, substantive rounds of, essentially, evidence gathering, taking the testimony and laying it out in a public way, rather than having lawmakers take turns and have it be a free-for-all of people trying to get their five minutes of soundbites in. And then when Republicans did try to upend things —

archived recording (devin nunes) I know, Ms. Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. I’ll yield to you, Ms. Stefanik. archived recording (elise stefanik) Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend.

julie hirschfeld davis

— Schiff really shut them down. There was a moment, a couple of hearings in, where Elise Stefanik, Republican congresswoman from New York, who Republicans wanted to spotlight, particularly because that day, they were hearing from a female witness, the former Ukraine ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. And they knew they were going to be accused of berating her and hammering at her, and she’s a woman and sort of mansplaining her. And so they really wanted Stefanik to have the spotlight.

archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. archived recording (elise stefanik) What is the interruption for this time? It is our time — archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized. Mr. Nunes, you are minority counsel — archived recording (devin nunes) I just recognized — archived recording (adam schiff) Under the House Resolution 660, you are not allowed to yield time except to minority counsel. archived recording (elise stefanik) The ranking member yielded time to another member of Congress. archived recording (adam schiff) No.

julie hirschfeld davis

They tried to yield time to her, and Schiff just shut it down.

archived recording (devin nunes) You’re gagging the young lady from New York? archived recording (elise stefanik) That is accurate. Ambassador Yovanovitch, I want to thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) Gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized.

michael barbaro

Right, and the rules would protect this sort of thing, theoretically, so that a member of the minority party on the Intelligence Committee wouldn’t, say, bring up the location of American C.I.A. agents overseas.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And granted, these issues that were coming up in the impeachment hearings were not strictly intelligence matters. There wasn’t necessarily a risk that anyone was going to go blabbing about black sites, but the rules that they were using were designed for those sorts of things. And so we saw Chairman Schiff take pretty good advantage of that.

michael barbaro

Right. Not that a bookish member of the Intelligence Committee would ever do such a thing, but just in case.

julie hirschfeld davis

Just in case.

michael barbaro

So the Republicans kind of get sidelined in this process because of these rules and the way the committee enforces them. What was the outcome for the Democrats who were overseeing this?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the outcome was very much as they had hoped it would be. They really were able to use the process to get what they needed out of the witnesses that they called.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting? The answer is yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

They laid out this narrative —

archived recording (adam schiff) It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.

julie hirschfeld davis

— accusing the president of having abused his power.

archived recording (eric swalwell) Can we also agree that it’s just wrong? archived recording (william taylor) Yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

And narratives from people who were there at key moments.

archived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call?

julie hirschfeld davis

Hearing his phone call with the president of Ukraine.

archived recording (alexander vindman) I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel. I had concerns, and it was my duty to report.

julie hirschfeld davis

Saying in front of a committee room that “everyone was in the loop.”

archived recording (gordon sondland) Everyone was in the loop.

julie hirschfeld davis

This came directly from the president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) At the express direction of the president of the United States.

julie hirschfeld davis

We were following the president’s orders.

archived recording (gordon sondland) So we followed the president’s orders.

julie hirschfeld davis

And basically got the information that they needed and the predicate for laying out a case against President Trump that could be grounds for impeachment.

archived recording We are going to House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff with a news conference on the impeachment committee report.

michael barbaro

Which brings us to Tuesday.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. So on Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee was ready to release its report and send it over to the House Judiciary Committee. So they put together this 300-page report, lots of footnotes, release it publicly. And then Adam Schiff, the committee chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) Good afternoon.

julie hirschfeld davis

— goes to the press gallery in the Capitol and lays it all out.

archived recording (adam schiff) This report chronicles a scheme by the president of the United States to coerce an ally, Ukraine, that is at war with an adversary, Russia, into doing the president’s political dirty work. It involves a scheme in which Donald Trump withheld official acts, a White House meeting, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military assistance, in order to compel that power to deliver two investigations that he believed would assist his re-election campaign.

julie hirschfeld davis

And he raises this question again of whether people should have to accept that this is conduct that the president is allowed to engage in, and essentially lays out the predicate for what they’re going to give to the Judiciary Committee.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I’m happy to respond to your questions.

julie hirschfeld davis

Then Schiff takes questions from reporters, and the first question is about, essentially, the only really new thing that is not familiar to people who watched the hearings.

archived recording When did you obtain the cell phone records that are in this report?

julie hirschfeld davis

And that is the cell phone records that show contact between Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, and various White House officials, including John Bolton, the former national security adviser, but also Devin Nunes, who is the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and his contacts with Lev Parnas, who is an associate of Rudy Giuliani, who was also pushing for the ouster of the Ukrainian ambassador, who the president wanted gone.

archived recording (adam schiff) But certainly the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.

michael barbaro

You’re telling me, though, that we just learned in this report that the leading Republican on the Intelligence Committee was communicating, and perhaps coordinating, with the White House and the president’s lawyer months ago, and communicating with key figures involved in the pressure campaign that that very committee he’s on is supposed to be investigating?

julie hirschfeld davis

Correct. It’s pretty stunning information, although we don’t know what was discussed in those calls. All we have is timestamps and phone numbers, and so it’s tough to reconstruct what the substance of those calls were. But it’s a pretty unusual situation all around.

archived recording (adam schiff) It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity.

michael barbaro

Julie, what’s your understanding of why, given the juiciness of what you just described, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of closing shop and handing all its work over to the Judiciary Committee, rather than continuing to figure out what just happened with Nunes and with everything else in the report?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, Schiff says that he basically is not closing up shop. There are still questions about these calls, and also other broader issues — like did this pressure campaign actually begin much earlier with the previous president of Ukraine? — that they still want answered. But what he says is that —

archived recording (adam schiff) There was more investigative work to be done. Even as we believe that we cannot wait because the president’s efforts to secure intervention in the next election persist, we continue our investigation and we will.

julie hirschfeld davis

The president’s efforts to get a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election are ongoing. And so we need to move. We need to get this thing going. And what he doesn’t say, but what is also the case, is that the outcome here is pretty much known, at least in the House. They are very likely to draft articles of impeachment, to vote them through, to send the matter to the Senate. And Democrats believe that they have the evidence that they need to do that, and so this is the moment, they think, to get this thing moving.

michael barbaro

And so now the work of the Judiciary Committee begins.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And on paper, they have a very simple and very somber task of taking this lengthy report and deciding whether this rises to the level of impeachable offenses, whether, under the Constitution, this is something that warrants the president’s removal. But remember, this is the Judiciary Committee. This is the messier, more partisan culture war committee, and nobody expects for this to be a very orderly or buttoned-down process.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Julie, the impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee. What makes it a messier place than the Intelligence Committee?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the rules of the Judiciary Committee are written for very different reasons than the rules of the Intelligence Committee are. They’re written to facilitate these freewheeling debates about policy and legislation and various matters that are of great interest to the public. So the minority has a lot of ability to interrupt the proceedings, to make points of order, to use parliamentary tactics to essentially make itself heard. Given that, and also given the members of the committee, it’s culturally a place of much more backing and forthing, and a pretty lively one.

michael barbaro

It feels like you’re saying that the best days of the impeachment inquiry for Democrats are now behind them.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it depends on your perspective. I think for some lawmakers, they have been waiting with great anticipation to have their moment to publicly say their piece about what they think about President Trump’s conduct, whether they’re Democrats and want to outline how egregiously horrible they think this has been, or Republicans and want to defend everything that the president has done. And for the rest of the Democratic caucus, I do think that there is some degree of worry that now is the part where things get really messy, where all of the talk of somber state debating goes out the window, and here we are in the Judiciary Committee having a food fight.

michael barbaro

Right. Nancy Pelosi is forever using this phrase. This is a “somber,” “prayerful” moment and process. And you’re saying it’s not going to be prayerful in that committee room.

julie hirschfeld davis

Probably will not look like most people’s image of prayerful.

michael barbaro

And what, specifically, will the Judiciary Committee be doing when it comes to determining the constitutionality of this impeachment inquiry?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, their first step is to hold a hearing today with constitutional scholars, who will basically testify about the history of impeachment, precedence for impeachment, and really what the definition is of an impeachable offense. And it’s not necessarily straightforward. It’s not straightforward at all. The Constitution doesn’t say very much about what a president or another official could be impeached for. There are certain phrases in there, like “high crimes and misdemeanors,” that have been hotly debated by legal scholars. So is a high crime a particularly egregious actual crime, or is it wrongdoing by a high official? That’s something that they’re going to have to work out. And on Tuesday, we saw the Democrats start to signal what their argument is going to be about, what counts as impeachable, and that it doesn’t have to be a crime. They quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Intelligence Committee report, explaining that impeachment is not only designed to cover criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. And they quote Hamilton saying, “The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They’re of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

michael barbaro

They don’t write like that anymore.

julie hirschfeld davis

No, for better or for worse.

michael barbaro

And is this always how the Judiciary Committee functions during an impeachment? I mean, calling constitutional scholars, professors, historians to basically ruminate on the very nature of what is impeachable?

archived recording The purpose of today’s hearing is to receive testimony from legal and constitutional scholars on the background and history of impeachment.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Judiciary Committee did do this same thing, back just before they started impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.

archived recording The most important question to this committee is the meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” It is important to remember that the word “high” in high crimes and misdemeanors was used to emphasize that it was a crime or misdemeanor against the commonwealth.

julie hirschfeld davis

And part of it is just laying out the reference points for them to be able to go back to to say, remember when these people who studied the Constitution and told us what it was all about and told us what impeachment was for said about what we should be considering? And so it’s a way for them to kind of give the public a concept of why they would be doing this.

michael barbaro

I get how the rules vary here in ways that would make the Judiciary Committee a messier process than the Intelligence Committee, but I’m honestly having a hard time imagining how interviewing constitutional scholars gets all that messy.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it has to do with what they’re interviewing the scholars about and the very, very different places that the Republicans and Democrats on the committee are coming from about that issue. They’re essentially going to be arguing over the Constitution and trying to compete with one another to elicit from these constitutional scholars the most favorable interpretation of what impeachment means and what the standard is for their side. So rather than arguing over who said what in a phone call with the Ukrainian president, or whether civil servants’ view of what President Trump did is legitimate or not legitimate, they’re actually going to be arguing over the Constitution itself and what those words, those few words that are in the Constitution about impeachment, actually mean in the context of what President Trump has done.

michael barbaro

Julie, you’ve said that it’s widely understood that the House is going to vote to impeach the president. That’s one of the reasons Schiff was in such a hurry to move this from the Intelligence Committee over to the Judiciary Committee. So what are these two different phases that you’ve been describing? Why do they ultimately matter? I mean, why does it matter that the Intelligence Committee ran this as a tightly controlled, buttoned-up process, and that it’s likely to get a lot messier in the Judiciary Committee, if we know the outcome of all this basically beforehand?

julie hirschfeld davis

Because I think there is a broader question of what does impeaching a president look like when it’s a purely partisan exercise? The Democrats opened this process with what was essentially a partisan vote to begin an impeachment inquiry. And if they engage now in a spectacle, in a sort of war, on the public stage over impeaching the president, they are very aware that they could lose whatever public support they do have for going forward with this, and that people could come away thinking that they have not been conscientious about what their constitutional duty is, that they’ve abused their positions and treated impeachment just like another partisan fight that they have with President Trump that essentially would trivialize the process, both in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of history. This is, after all, a process that’s enshrined in the Constitution, and Democrats don’t want to be the ones who are blamed with tainting that process and undermining it. So there is a real risk for them that in this realm that they’re about to enter, that they’re going to come off looking like less than they should.

michael barbaro

Right. They could undermine what the Intelligence Committee seemed to have pulled off, in part because of the rules that allowed for it, that gave the power to the majority, and therefore allowed them to conduct that first phase in a way that seemed kind of high-minded and, as Nancy Pelosi would say, prayerful.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. They largely hit their mark in the first phase of this inquiry, and now they are keenly aware that, having demonstrated to the public that they are taking this seriously, that they’re being disciplined about how they’re going about it, that they’re honoring the process, that it could all unravel.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. may lose the Iowa caucuses. But he is betting on strong support from black voters in Southern states and urban areas to help him accrue the 1,990 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.

It might work. That’s because an overwhelming majority of delegates are awarded from areas more racially diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire. If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests.

Think of it this way: Candidates gain delegates based on voting in both states and districts, which are Congressional districts in all but a few places. While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates.

A recent poll shows Mr. Biden at 44 percent among black voters in South Carolina, the early voting state with a majority-black Democratic electorate, and a historic harbinger for how the South will vote. The same poll had Mr. Biden’s next closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, trailing him by more than 30 percentage points among black voters.

Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham, Ala., who has yet to endorse a candidate, said national political analysts are underestimating the political advantages Mr. Biden enjoys in the South.

“It’s not that he’s weaker than people think,” Mr. Woodfin said. “He’s much stronger.”

In most states, districts are Congressional districts, but can be other boundaries. Texas, included in the graphic, uses state legislature districts. North Carolina districts may change, pending redistricting.

As the chart above shows, some of the most delegate-rich districts in Southern states like Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina have large shares of black Democratic voters. (Vermont is an exception; its population is largely white, but it has only one district with 11 Democratic delegates.)

Under party rules, more delegates are awarded in districts with high concentrations of Democrats. Because black people overwhelmingly vote Democratic, areas with many black residents tend to have higher numbers of Democratic delegates.

This is a big reason why black Democrats are so sought-after in the race for the party’s nomination. Historically, black Democratic primary voters have tended to back a single candidate, helping thrust the voting bloc to the forefront in Southern states where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate. If a single candidate can get huge vote margins with black Democrats, like Barack Obama did in 2008 and Hillary Clinton did in 2016, he or she can amass a big delegate lead over other candidates.

The last Democratic candidate to win the nomination without winning a majority of black voters was Michael Dukakis, then the governor of Massachusetts, in 1988; Rev. Jesse Jackson secured more of their support. In 2004, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts won the nomination with a slight majority of black votes, after battling with Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.

Cornell Belcher, the pollster who helped conduct much of Mr. Obama's South Carolina research, compared Mr. Biden’s support in black communities in the 2020 primary to the advantages Mrs. Clinton experienced early in 2008. However, he said, none of Mr. Biden’s rivals are replicating Mr. Obama’s robust black grass-roots program.

“If they were replicating what we did in 2007, they would already have the resources and infrastructure on the ground in South Carolina like we did,” he said. “If they were replicating what we did in ‘07, there would already be a Harris or Buttigieg barber shop and hair salon program in place on the grass-roots level that went under and around the black establishment in the state.”

The delegate calendar for the Democratic Party also shows the limitations of viewing the race through the prisms of the early states.

The vast majority of delegates awarded early in the race come on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 15 states and territories will hold their primaries and caucuses. More than 1,300 pledged delegates are awarded that day.

By the end of Super Tuesday, 38 percent of all the pledged delegates in 19 states and territories will have been allocated, making it difficult for candidates to build a voter coalition if they are not competitive by that point.

The candidates best positioned to overtake Mr. Biden’s voter coalition at this point — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mr. Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — each face challenges in attracting a diverse range of voters, albeit to varying degrees.

Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have shown some traction with younger, nonwhite voters. Mr. Sanders in particular has polled better among nonwhite voters than any candidate other than Mr. Biden, though he remains a distant second. He is also betting on an electoral strategy that will encourage those who sat out the 2016 primary to join the process, which supporters believe will help him grow his diverse coalition.

There are signs in California, the primary’s most delegate-rich state, that Ms. Warren can challenge Mr. Biden on more diverse territory. Ms. Warren has led some polls in the state, and her team says that a good showing in the early states can unlock more support, citing the backing of diverse progressive groups like the Working Families Party.

Mr. Buttigieg is a unique case. While he has shown significant momentum in Iowa, that support has yet to translate outside the first state. Unlike Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders he has been anemic with black voters — polling again at 0 percent in the latest South Carolina survey — and several high-profile errors have helped create a reputation that his campaign has a blindspot for nonwhite constituencies.

Without a reversal, Mr. Buttigieg risks joining a dubious list: Candidates who succeeded in Iowa and New Hampshire but nonetheless lost the Democratic nomination.

Most eventual Democratic nominees won Iowa or New Hampshire Year Eventual nominee Iowa New Hampshire 1972 George McGovern 1976 Jimmy Carter 1980 Jimmy Carter 1984 Walter Mondale 1988 Michael Dukakis 1992 Bill Clinton 2000 Al Gore 2004 John Kerry 2008 Barack Obama 2016 Hillary Clinton Sources: Des Moines Register, New York Times | Note: Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012 are excluded because they were incumbents with no significant challengers.

Some candidates who are struggling to break through Mr. Biden’s advantage with black voters have compared their plight to Mr. Obama’s; he won Iowa in 2008 and built a national coalition after. However, Mr. Belcher said that comparison should be scrutinized, considering Mr. Obama was much better positioned across the country than many of the candidates who likened themselves to him.

Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris of California, among others, are now banking on a breakthrough in Iowa to help propel them forward in the early states and compete with Mr. Biden among black voters in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday. Ms. Harris, for one, has been making direct appeals to black voters in the South.

“When we talk about black girl magic, we know that it is something special,” Ms. Harris told a crowd at Benedict College, a historically black institution in Columbia, S.C. “But that magic is born out of hard work.”

Mr. Belcher acknowledged that few 2020 candidates have the resources that were available to Mr. Obama in 2007, but he also said the campaigns have been guilty of “lazy thinking,” if they planned to wrest Mr. Biden’s black support simply by winning an early state.

“They are taking a key constituency that they need for granted,” he said."

Here’s His Strategy.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/politics/joe-biden-campaign-iowa.html,"This is the U.S. secretary of war in 1908, William Taft. One day, he decides that he wants a formal portrait of himself. The photographer arrives, but then the phone rings. He starts taking pictures anyway. On the phone is Taft’s friend Theodore Roosevelt, the president. It’s a long conversation, but suddenly, the photographer lucks out. Taft learns that Roosevelt’s chosen him to run for president as his successor. It’s a good choice. Taft goes on to the campaign trail and wins. It’s an historic win because, even though he’s the 27th president, he’s only the first president to win after running a big nationwide campaign tour. Before him, presidential candidates were expected to stay quiet, sit at home. Several decades later — [Music playing] So how did we get here, from a time when personally campaigning for president was unheard of to — We’ll start in 1789. George Washington becomes America’s first president. The founders are hell-bent on making sure a president can’t accumulate too much power. Remember, they just kicked out a king. They don’t want another one of those. They want a president to be humble, like the George Washington depicted here as a simple farmer. If a candidate goes directly to the public, campaigns for themself and asks for votes, it could be a warning sign. They may be power-hungry, a wannabe English king in waiting. “The office must seek the man, not the man the office,” one historian explained. Basically, today’s campaigning would seem very sketchy indeed. Anyway, Washington sets the tone. He’s careful not to appear at all like he wants the presidency. He’s there out of duty. Washington’s example will loom large over presidential candidates for the next century, even as the country quickly changes. This is a political cartoon from 1852. That’s a presidential candidate. That’s a political party boss. And that’s the candidate’s mouth, kept shut. As the country grows, political parties also grow. They choose who the candidates will be and they do all the campaigning on the candidate’s behalf. The candidates, well, they’re expected to stay reserved, Washington-like, mouth shut. But occasionally, candidates campaign anyway. And they’re the ones who slowly chip away at tradition. Let’s go to 1860 for one glaring example. Abraham Lincoln is running against three others for the presidency. One of them decides to throw precedence out the window. Stephen Douglas, a man who’s in danger of losing, decides to go on a big campaign tour. But because of tradition, he can’t just come out and say what he’s doing. So Douglas makes excuses. He says the tour is in order to see his mother in upstate New York, visit his childhood home in Vermont, and watch his brother-in-law graduate from Harvard. Along the way, he makes campaign speeches, and gets heaps of criticism for doing so. The New York Times writes that the presidency is “too high to be reached by a mere stump speaker, and too dignified to be canvassed for like a county clerkship or a seat in Congress.” Douglas, of course, loses, but the size of his stumping tour is another step towards public campaigning. Things will loosen up a bit more, quite by accident, on a front porch in Ohio two decades later. Meanwhile, the political parties have gotten so big and so corrupt there’s a backlash against them. Americans want to interact more with the candidates directly, without the party machines getting in the way. Enter Republican nominee James Garfield. He’s planned to spend the election of 1880 laying low at his home in Ohio, just as candidates usually do. But then, people keep showing up at his house. They want to see their candidate in person. Garfield’s got to say something. He can’t just ignore them. So he gives a bunch of short speeches from his front porch. Garfield has stumbled on a way to personally campaign without risking criticism by going on some big campaign tour. He just does it from home and says it’s because people just showed up. He wins. But this doesn’t turn the tide entirely. 16 years later, however, there’s an upset at the Democratic National Convention. An obscure Nebraska congressman is nominated for president, William Jennings Bryan. He’s so polarizing that many in his party won’t campaign for him. That means Bryan has to do it himself, which is fine, because his whole persona is being a voice for the common people against powerful institutions. It makes sense that he’d ignore political traditions and instead speak to voters himself. He covers 27 states. His opponent, William McKinley, on the other hand, doesn’t hit the road. He takes a page from Garfield’s book, and give speeches from his own front porch. “My fellow citizens —” But it’s all much grander this time. There are parades out front. 750,000 people come to visit. Both strategies are extreme for the time, but McKinley’s is safer. One way to look at what’s going on here is with this pro-McKinley cartoon. It plays up their age difference. McKinley served in the Civil War when Bryan was still a baby. Bryan is now 36, part of a whole new generation. He’s less connected to the colonial traditions that kept candidates at a distance from the public. McKinley ends up winning anyway, but when they have a rematch for president four years later, McKinley doesn’t actively campaign for re-election because now McKinley is a president. And damn the winds of change, remember, the presidency is too sacred an office to use for campaigning. Enter the man so consumed with the limelight that his daughter once said he wanted to be “the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral.” Teddy Roosevelt, McKinley’s running mate. No one said vice presidential candidates can’t stump. As Bryan and Roosevelt go at it in 1900, we see two young, brash candidates drawing crowds with their charisma. Or as historian Gil Troy puts it, they “helped bury a century-old tradition of candidate passivity.” And then four years later, the man who loves a crowd, now President Teddy Roosevelt, falls silent when it’s time to run for his re-election. Presidents still mustn’t campaign. Now is when we come to William Taft, whose big smile we saw at the beginning. And I want to use this image to explain what happens during the election of 1908. On the right is a Taft mannequin. On the left is a William Jennings Bryan mannequin. He’s running again, for a third time. Let’s look closer. There’s a phonograph playing pre-recorded speeches by the candidates. Signs encourage voters to also hear the candidates’ rebuttals to each other. It’s even assumed that voters will pay money to hear all this. That’s how far American norms have shifted in the new century. They expect a more direct democracy with accessible candidates. Now the funny thing about this is, is that Taft is totally against this idea at first. He’s more keen on staying old-school and holding a front porch campaign. No one really shows up. But with Bryan on the road getting all the attention and Taft’s allies pushing him to do the same, he doesn’t have a choice. This is how it works now. He hits the campaign trail, literally following in the footsteps of Bryan. It goes great. He wins. Historian Richard Ellis notes that Taft “helped erase the association between stumping and losing.” Like I said at the beginning, the first president to be elected after making a full campaign tour. It’s not like there’s something about Taft that makes him the first president to stump mightily and win. It’s the combination of incremental changes in American society and behaviors by earlier candidates. If we zip ahead to 1944, we can look back and see just how far things have come. It’s Franklin Roosevelt’s last campaign. At one point, he gets driven 50 miles through the streets of New York City, in an open car, in winter. “And a great welcome from all the boroughs.” An incumbent president pleading his case to the public for a fourth term. The campaigns, the rallies, they all just become part of seeking the presidency. So when you watch presidential candidates on the campaign trail, sitting in diners, riding in buses, shaking hands and taking selfies, and crowd surfing, it’s not quite what the founders intended, but it’s what the people demanded. [Cheering] So five minutes into the video, we talked about President McKinley’s famous front porch campaign. Turns out McKinley is famous for another type of public appearance. His two inaugurations were the first to ever be recorded by a moving picture camera. If you look closely, you can see the chief justice of the Supreme Court raising his hand to give the oath of office. Consequently, McKinley’s was the first presidential funeral to also be filmed. He was assassinated during his second term."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The House Intelligence Committee has released its impeachment report to the Judiciary Committee, signaling the end of one phase of impeachment and the beginning of another. Julie Davis on why those two phases will look so different. It’s Wednesday, December 4. Julie, tell me about these two phases of the House impeachment inquiry.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the House Intelligence Committee has just finished its report and completed its work, and now the House Judiciary Committee has its job to do. And these are two very different committees. The House Intelligence Committee is a very buttoned-up, frequently less partisan place. They deal in matters of intelligence. They oversee the intelligence community. They deal in state secrets, and because of that —

archived recording (mike rogers) Committee has been extensively briefed on these efforts over a regular basis as a part of our ongoing oversight responsibility.

julie hirschfeld davis

— it attracts the workhorse members who are into dealing with long reports, really meaty, substantive issues, oftentimes behind closed doors, not in front of the news cameras.

archived recording (mike rogers) Ranking member and I believe it is important to hold an open hearing today, and we don’t do a tremendous amount of those.

julie hirschfeld davis

Dilatory tactics, parliamentary stunts — that sort of thing just doesn’t happen that often in the Intelligence Committee, because that’s just not what they’re about.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) The Judiciary Committee will come to order, and without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.

julie hirschfeld davis

The Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is kind of known for that. And the Judiciary Committee oversees the federal courts and the Justice Department, but it also has jurisdiction over cultural hot button issues.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) We welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on “Planned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s Largest Abortion Provider.”

julie hirschfeld davis

It has jurisdiction over questions of abortion rights, over gun rights —

archived recording (lucy mcbath) I ask my colleagues on this committee, both Republicans and Democrats, to stand up with me in supporting this legislation. We have to save lives.

julie hirschfeld davis

— some of the things that typically draw the most fervent responses from both parties. And so it attracts members who want to engage in that level of really partisan debate — people who really seek out the spotlight, who want to engage in culture war type of subjects that come before the Judiciary Committee, they sort of excel in these very highly partisan public debates. These debates that happen in the Judiciary Committee are typically much more raucous, much more freewheeling, and it’s a much more partisan place.

michael barbaro

So crude summary here. The Intelligence Committee is dominated by rule-oriented leaders, the workhorses. The Judiciary Committee is more dominated by cultural warriors, the show horses.

julie hirschfeld davis

That’s right. And to be clear, there is some overlap between the two committees. There are people who serve on both committees. And it’s not like everyone on the Judiciary Committee is guns blazing, culture warrior, and everyone on the Intelligence Committee is a dry consumer of long intelligence reports.

michael barbaro

[CHUCKLES]

julie hirschfeld davis

But that is the profile of these two committees, and those tend to be the sorts of people who seek out seats on the Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, so there is kind of a cultural difference there.

michael barbaro

So explain how these different roles of these two committees are actually playing out in this impeachment inquiry. Let’s start with the Intelligence Committee, since its work has just been completed. How has its broader role, its rules and its mission reflected in the work of the impeachment inquiry over the past few weeks?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Intelligence Committee is used to working in secret, working in a setting where you’re controlling the flow of information. Because by definition, they’re dealing with intelligence matters, and that can’t be debated freely on the House floor in the halls. And its procedures also reflect that. There is less opportunity for the minority party to shut down the proceedings, because if they were allowed to do that, that could be dangerous. I mean, that has actual implications, potentially, for national security. So the very rules of the committee they’re used to operating under are just tighter by definition. And you saw Adam Schiff, the chairman of the committee, really using that to his advantage when it came to controlling the witness list, having a say in who Republicans would be able to call as public witnesses.

michael barbaro

Right.

julie hirschfeld davis

So Republicans, for instance, wanted to call Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, which — Democrats knew that that would be a red herring. And so they did not sign off on calling Hunter Biden. They did allow Republicans to call some witnesses. We saw them call Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, who was a former National Security Council official. So they didn’t shut them down altogether, but again, the committee operates in this way where the rights of the minority are proscribed such that they can’t just do anything they want whenever they want.

michael barbaro

And what about the witnesses who the Democrats wanted to call? How did they use the Intelligence Committee’s rules to their advantage?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, they were very careful to design a process where the lawyers for each side would be doing, or could be doing, the bulk of the questioning. So that was a concerted move on the part of Adam Schiff, the chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) We’ll now move to the 45-minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes.

julie hirschfeld davis

— to have long, substantive rounds of, essentially, evidence gathering, taking the testimony and laying it out in a public way, rather than having lawmakers take turns and have it be a free-for-all of people trying to get their five minutes of soundbites in. And then when Republicans did try to upend things —

archived recording (devin nunes) I know, Ms. Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. I’ll yield to you, Ms. Stefanik. archived recording (elise stefanik) Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend.

julie hirschfeld davis

— Schiff really shut them down. There was a moment, a couple of hearings in, where Elise Stefanik, Republican congresswoman from New York, who Republicans wanted to spotlight, particularly because that day, they were hearing from a female witness, the former Ukraine ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. And they knew they were going to be accused of berating her and hammering at her, and she’s a woman and sort of mansplaining her. And so they really wanted Stefanik to have the spotlight.

archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. archived recording (elise stefanik) What is the interruption for this time? It is our time — archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized. Mr. Nunes, you are minority counsel — archived recording (devin nunes) I just recognized — archived recording (adam schiff) Under the House Resolution 660, you are not allowed to yield time except to minority counsel. archived recording (elise stefanik) The ranking member yielded time to another member of Congress. archived recording (adam schiff) No.

julie hirschfeld davis

They tried to yield time to her, and Schiff just shut it down.

archived recording (devin nunes) You’re gagging the young lady from New York? archived recording (elise stefanik) That is accurate. Ambassador Yovanovitch, I want to thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) Gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized.

michael barbaro

Right, and the rules would protect this sort of thing, theoretically, so that a member of the minority party on the Intelligence Committee wouldn’t, say, bring up the location of American C.I.A. agents overseas.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And granted, these issues that were coming up in the impeachment hearings were not strictly intelligence matters. There wasn’t necessarily a risk that anyone was going to go blabbing about black sites, but the rules that they were using were designed for those sorts of things. And so we saw Chairman Schiff take pretty good advantage of that.

michael barbaro

Right. Not that a bookish member of the Intelligence Committee would ever do such a thing, but just in case.

julie hirschfeld davis

Just in case.

michael barbaro

So the Republicans kind of get sidelined in this process because of these rules and the way the committee enforces them. What was the outcome for the Democrats who were overseeing this?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the outcome was very much as they had hoped it would be. They really were able to use the process to get what they needed out of the witnesses that they called.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting? The answer is yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

They laid out this narrative —

archived recording (adam schiff) It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.

julie hirschfeld davis

— accusing the president of having abused his power.

archived recording (eric swalwell) Can we also agree that it’s just wrong? archived recording (william taylor) Yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

And narratives from people who were there at key moments.

archived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call?

julie hirschfeld davis

Hearing his phone call with the president of Ukraine.

archived recording (alexander vindman) I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel. I had concerns, and it was my duty to report.

julie hirschfeld davis

Saying in front of a committee room that “everyone was in the loop.”

archived recording (gordon sondland) Everyone was in the loop.

julie hirschfeld davis

This came directly from the president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) At the express direction of the president of the United States.

julie hirschfeld davis

We were following the president’s orders.

archived recording (gordon sondland) So we followed the president’s orders.

julie hirschfeld davis

And basically got the information that they needed and the predicate for laying out a case against President Trump that could be grounds for impeachment.

archived recording We are going to House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff with a news conference on the impeachment committee report.

michael barbaro

Which brings us to Tuesday.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. So on Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee was ready to release its report and send it over to the House Judiciary Committee. So they put together this 300-page report, lots of footnotes, release it publicly. And then Adam Schiff, the committee chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) Good afternoon.

julie hirschfeld davis

— goes to the press gallery in the Capitol and lays it all out.

archived recording (adam schiff) This report chronicles a scheme by the president of the United States to coerce an ally, Ukraine, that is at war with an adversary, Russia, into doing the president’s political dirty work. It involves a scheme in which Donald Trump withheld official acts, a White House meeting, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military assistance, in order to compel that power to deliver two investigations that he believed would assist his re-election campaign.

julie hirschfeld davis

And he raises this question again of whether people should have to accept that this is conduct that the president is allowed to engage in, and essentially lays out the predicate for what they’re going to give to the Judiciary Committee.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I’m happy to respond to your questions.

julie hirschfeld davis

Then Schiff takes questions from reporters, and the first question is about, essentially, the only really new thing that is not familiar to people who watched the hearings.

archived recording When did you obtain the cell phone records that are in this report?

julie hirschfeld davis

And that is the cell phone records that show contact between Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, and various White House officials, including John Bolton, the former national security adviser, but also Devin Nunes, who is the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and his contacts with Lev Parnas, who is an associate of Rudy Giuliani, who was also pushing for the ouster of the Ukrainian ambassador, who the president wanted gone.

archived recording (adam schiff) But certainly the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.

michael barbaro

You’re telling me, though, that we just learned in this report that the leading Republican on the Intelligence Committee was communicating, and perhaps coordinating, with the White House and the president’s lawyer months ago, and communicating with key figures involved in the pressure campaign that that very committee he’s on is supposed to be investigating?

julie hirschfeld davis

Correct. It’s pretty stunning information, although we don’t know what was discussed in those calls. All we have is timestamps and phone numbers, and so it’s tough to reconstruct what the substance of those calls were. But it’s a pretty unusual situation all around.

archived recording (adam schiff) It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity.

michael barbaro

Julie, what’s your understanding of why, given the juiciness of what you just described, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of closing shop and handing all its work over to the Judiciary Committee, rather than continuing to figure out what just happened with Nunes and with everything else in the report?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, Schiff says that he basically is not closing up shop. There are still questions about these calls, and also other broader issues — like did this pressure campaign actually begin much earlier with the previous president of Ukraine? — that they still want answered. But what he says is that —

archived recording (adam schiff) There was more investigative work to be done. Even as we believe that we cannot wait because the president’s efforts to secure intervention in the next election persist, we continue our investigation and we will.

julie hirschfeld davis

The president’s efforts to get a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election are ongoing. And so we need to move. We need to get this thing going. And what he doesn’t say, but what is also the case, is that the outcome here is pretty much known, at least in the House. They are very likely to draft articles of impeachment, to vote them through, to send the matter to the Senate. And Democrats believe that they have the evidence that they need to do that, and so this is the moment, they think, to get this thing moving.

michael barbaro

And so now the work of the Judiciary Committee begins.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And on paper, they have a very simple and very somber task of taking this lengthy report and deciding whether this rises to the level of impeachable offenses, whether, under the Constitution, this is something that warrants the president’s removal. But remember, this is the Judiciary Committee. This is the messier, more partisan culture war committee, and nobody expects for this to be a very orderly or buttoned-down process.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Julie, the impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee. What makes it a messier place than the Intelligence Committee?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the rules of the Judiciary Committee are written for very different reasons than the rules of the Intelligence Committee are. They’re written to facilitate these freewheeling debates about policy and legislation and various matters that are of great interest to the public. So the minority has a lot of ability to interrupt the proceedings, to make points of order, to use parliamentary tactics to essentially make itself heard. Given that, and also given the members of the committee, it’s culturally a place of much more backing and forthing, and a pretty lively one.

michael barbaro

It feels like you’re saying that the best days of the impeachment inquiry for Democrats are now behind them.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it depends on your perspective. I think for some lawmakers, they have been waiting with great anticipation to have their moment to publicly say their piece about what they think about President Trump’s conduct, whether they’re Democrats and want to outline how egregiously horrible they think this has been, or Republicans and want to defend everything that the president has done. And for the rest of the Democratic caucus, I do think that there is some degree of worry that now is the part where things get really messy, where all of the talk of somber state debating goes out the window, and here we are in the Judiciary Committee having a food fight.

michael barbaro

Right. Nancy Pelosi is forever using this phrase. This is a “somber,” “prayerful” moment and process. And you’re saying it’s not going to be prayerful in that committee room.

julie hirschfeld davis

Probably will not look like most people’s image of prayerful.

michael barbaro

And what, specifically, will the Judiciary Committee be doing when it comes to determining the constitutionality of this impeachment inquiry?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, their first step is to hold a hearing today with constitutional scholars, who will basically testify about the history of impeachment, precedence for impeachment, and really what the definition is of an impeachable offense. And it’s not necessarily straightforward. It’s not straightforward at all. The Constitution doesn’t say very much about what a president or another official could be impeached for. There are certain phrases in there, like “high crimes and misdemeanors,” that have been hotly debated by legal scholars. So is a high crime a particularly egregious actual crime, or is it wrongdoing by a high official? That’s something that they’re going to have to work out. And on Tuesday, we saw the Democrats start to signal what their argument is going to be about, what counts as impeachable, and that it doesn’t have to be a crime. They quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Intelligence Committee report, explaining that impeachment is not only designed to cover criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. And they quote Hamilton saying, “The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They’re of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

michael barbaro

They don’t write like that anymore.

julie hirschfeld davis

No, for better or for worse.

michael barbaro

And is this always how the Judiciary Committee functions during an impeachment? I mean, calling constitutional scholars, professors, historians to basically ruminate on the very nature of what is impeachable?

archived recording The purpose of today’s hearing is to receive testimony from legal and constitutional scholars on the background and history of impeachment.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Judiciary Committee did do this same thing, back just before they started impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.

archived recording The most important question to this committee is the meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” It is important to remember that the word “high” in high crimes and misdemeanors was used to emphasize that it was a crime or misdemeanor against the commonwealth.

julie hirschfeld davis

And part of it is just laying out the reference points for them to be able to go back to to say, remember when these people who studied the Constitution and told us what it was all about and told us what impeachment was for said about what we should be considering? And so it’s a way for them to kind of give the public a concept of why they would be doing this.

michael barbaro

I get how the rules vary here in ways that would make the Judiciary Committee a messier process than the Intelligence Committee, but I’m honestly having a hard time imagining how interviewing constitutional scholars gets all that messy.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it has to do with what they’re interviewing the scholars about and the very, very different places that the Republicans and Democrats on the committee are coming from about that issue. They’re essentially going to be arguing over the Constitution and trying to compete with one another to elicit from these constitutional scholars the most favorable interpretation of what impeachment means and what the standard is for their side. So rather than arguing over who said what in a phone call with the Ukrainian president, or whether civil servants’ view of what President Trump did is legitimate or not legitimate, they’re actually going to be arguing over the Constitution itself and what those words, those few words that are in the Constitution about impeachment, actually mean in the context of what President Trump has done.

michael barbaro

Julie, you’ve said that it’s widely understood that the House is going to vote to impeach the president. That’s one of the reasons Schiff was in such a hurry to move this from the Intelligence Committee over to the Judiciary Committee. So what are these two different phases that you’ve been describing? Why do they ultimately matter? I mean, why does it matter that the Intelligence Committee ran this as a tightly controlled, buttoned-up process, and that it’s likely to get a lot messier in the Judiciary Committee, if we know the outcome of all this basically beforehand?

julie hirschfeld davis

Because I think there is a broader question of what does impeaching a president look like when it’s a purely partisan exercise? The Democrats opened this process with what was essentially a partisan vote to begin an impeachment inquiry. And if they engage now in a spectacle, in a sort of war, on the public stage over impeaching the president, they are very aware that they could lose whatever public support they do have for going forward with this, and that people could come away thinking that they have not been conscientious about what their constitutional duty is, that they’ve abused their positions and treated impeachment just like another partisan fight that they have with President Trump that essentially would trivialize the process, both in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of history. This is, after all, a process that’s enshrined in the Constitution, and Democrats don’t want to be the ones who are blamed with tainting that process and undermining it. So there is a real risk for them that in this realm that they’re about to enter, that they’re going to come off looking like less than they should.

michael barbaro

Right. They could undermine what the Intelligence Committee seemed to have pulled off, in part because of the rules that allowed for it, that gave the power to the majority, and therefore allowed them to conduct that first phase in a way that seemed kind of high-minded and, as Nancy Pelosi would say, prayerful.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. They largely hit their mark in the first phase of this inquiry, and now they are keenly aware that, having demonstrated to the public that they are taking this seriously, that they’re being disciplined about how they’re going about it, that they’re honoring the process, that it could all unravel.

Goldman met Representative Adam B. Schiff in a classic Washington way: They struck up a conversation in the green room at MSNBC.

The men, both Democrats, had plenty to talk about. Both former federal prosecutors, Mr. Schiff had a deep interest in Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, while Mr. Goldman had investigated Russian organized crime. He told Mr. Schiff to call him if he could be of use. When Democrats won the House and Mr. Schiff became chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he did, inviting Mr. Goldman to join his staff as the chief investigator.

Now Mr. Goldman is the lead author of a report, a draft of which committee members were able to review in private starting Monday evening, that forms the backbone of Democrats’ case for impeaching Mr. Trump. He is one of two unelected officials — the other is Stephen R. Castor, his Republican counterpart, who compiled the dissenting views — who have taken a crucial and unusually public job in the debate over the future of Mr. Trump’s presidency, and the nation.

The pair achieved a measure of Washington stardom over two weeks last month as they grilled witnesses during nationally televised public hearings. The House Judiciary Committee this week begins public hearings to consider articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, meaning Mr. Goldman will probably take the spotlight again to present the Democrats’ case that the president abused his power by trying to enlist Ukraine to dig up damaging information on his political rivals, and it will fall to Mr. Castor to counter it."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The House Intelligence Committee has released its impeachment report to the Judiciary Committee, signaling the end of one phase of impeachment and the beginning of another. Julie Davis on why those two phases will look so different. It’s Wednesday, December 4. Julie, tell me about these two phases of the House impeachment inquiry.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the House Intelligence Committee has just finished its report and completed its work, and now the House Judiciary Committee has its job to do. And these are two very different committees. The House Intelligence Committee is a very buttoned-up, frequently less partisan place. They deal in matters of intelligence. They oversee the intelligence community. They deal in state secrets, and because of that —

archived recording (mike rogers) Committee has been extensively briefed on these efforts over a regular basis as a part of our ongoing oversight responsibility.

julie hirschfeld davis

— it attracts the workhorse members who are into dealing with long reports, really meaty, substantive issues, oftentimes behind closed doors, not in front of the news cameras.

archived recording (mike rogers) Ranking member and I believe it is important to hold an open hearing today, and we don’t do a tremendous amount of those.

julie hirschfeld davis

Dilatory tactics, parliamentary stunts — that sort of thing just doesn’t happen that often in the Intelligence Committee, because that’s just not what they’re about.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) The Judiciary Committee will come to order, and without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.

julie hirschfeld davis

The Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is kind of known for that. And the Judiciary Committee oversees the federal courts and the Justice Department, but it also has jurisdiction over cultural hot button issues.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) We welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on “Planned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s Largest Abortion Provider.”

julie hirschfeld davis

It has jurisdiction over questions of abortion rights, over gun rights —

archived recording (lucy mcbath) I ask my colleagues on this committee, both Republicans and Democrats, to stand up with me in supporting this legislation. We have to save lives.

julie hirschfeld davis

— some of the things that typically draw the most fervent responses from both parties. And so it attracts members who want to engage in that level of really partisan debate — people who really seek out the spotlight, who want to engage in culture war type of subjects that come before the Judiciary Committee, they sort of excel in these very highly partisan public debates. These debates that happen in the Judiciary Committee are typically much more raucous, much more freewheeling, and it’s a much more partisan place.

michael barbaro

So crude summary here. The Intelligence Committee is dominated by rule-oriented leaders, the workhorses. The Judiciary Committee is more dominated by cultural warriors, the show horses.

julie hirschfeld davis

That’s right. And to be clear, there is some overlap between the two committees. There are people who serve on both committees. And it’s not like everyone on the Judiciary Committee is guns blazing, culture warrior, and everyone on the Intelligence Committee is a dry consumer of long intelligence reports.

michael barbaro

[CHUCKLES]

julie hirschfeld davis

But that is the profile of these two committees, and those tend to be the sorts of people who seek out seats on the Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, so there is kind of a cultural difference there.

michael barbaro

So explain how these different roles of these two committees are actually playing out in this impeachment inquiry. Let’s start with the Intelligence Committee, since its work has just been completed. How has its broader role, its rules and its mission reflected in the work of the impeachment inquiry over the past few weeks?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Intelligence Committee is used to working in secret, working in a setting where you’re controlling the flow of information. Because by definition, they’re dealing with intelligence matters, and that can’t be debated freely on the House floor in the halls. And its procedures also reflect that. There is less opportunity for the minority party to shut down the proceedings, because if they were allowed to do that, that could be dangerous. I mean, that has actual implications, potentially, for national security. So the very rules of the committee they’re used to operating under are just tighter by definition. And you saw Adam Schiff, the chairman of the committee, really using that to his advantage when it came to controlling the witness list, having a say in who Republicans would be able to call as public witnesses.

michael barbaro

Right.

julie hirschfeld davis

So Republicans, for instance, wanted to call Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, which — Democrats knew that that would be a red herring. And so they did not sign off on calling Hunter Biden. They did allow Republicans to call some witnesses. We saw them call Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, who was a former National Security Council official. So they didn’t shut them down altogether, but again, the committee operates in this way where the rights of the minority are proscribed such that they can’t just do anything they want whenever they want.

michael barbaro

And what about the witnesses who the Democrats wanted to call? How did they use the Intelligence Committee’s rules to their advantage?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, they were very careful to design a process where the lawyers for each side would be doing, or could be doing, the bulk of the questioning. So that was a concerted move on the part of Adam Schiff, the chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) We’ll now move to the 45-minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes.

julie hirschfeld davis

— to have long, substantive rounds of, essentially, evidence gathering, taking the testimony and laying it out in a public way, rather than having lawmakers take turns and have it be a free-for-all of people trying to get their five minutes of soundbites in. And then when Republicans did try to upend things —

archived recording (devin nunes) I know, Ms. Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. I’ll yield to you, Ms. Stefanik. archived recording (elise stefanik) Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend.

julie hirschfeld davis

— Schiff really shut them down. There was a moment, a couple of hearings in, where Elise Stefanik, Republican congresswoman from New York, who Republicans wanted to spotlight, particularly because that day, they were hearing from a female witness, the former Ukraine ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. And they knew they were going to be accused of berating her and hammering at her, and she’s a woman and sort of mansplaining her. And so they really wanted Stefanik to have the spotlight.

They tried to yield time to her, and Schiff just shut it down.

michael barbaro

Right, and the rules would protect this sort of thing, theoretically, so that a member of the minority party on the Intelligence Committee wouldn’t, say, bring up the location of American C.I.A. agents overseas.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And granted, these issues that were coming up in the impeachment hearings were not strictly intelligence matters. There wasn’t necessarily a risk that anyone was going to go blabbing about black sites, but the rules that they were using were designed for those sorts of things. And so we saw Chairman Schiff take pretty good advantage of that.

michael barbaro

Right. Not that a bookish member of the Intelligence Committee would ever do such a thing, but just in case.

julie hirschfeld davis

Just in case.

michael barbaro

So the Republicans kind of get sidelined in this process because of these rules and the way the committee enforces them. What was the outcome for the Democrats who were overseeing this?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the outcome was very much as they had hoped it would be. They really were able to use the process to get what they needed out of the witnesses that they called.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting? The answer is yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

They laid out this narrative —

archived recording (adam schiff) It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.

— accusing the president of having abused his power.

archived recording (eric swalwell) Can we also agree that it’s just wrong? archived recording (william taylor) Yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

And narratives from people who were there at key moments.

archived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call?

julie hirschfeld davis

Hearing his phone call with the president of Ukraine.

archived recording (alexander vindman) I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel. I had concerns, and it was my duty to report.

julie hirschfeld davis

Saying in front of a committee room that “everyone was in the loop.”

archived recording (gordon sondland) Everyone was in the loop.

julie hirschfeld davis

This came directly from the president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) At the express direction of the president of the United States.

julie hirschfeld davis

We were following the president’s orders.

archived recording (gordon sondland) So we followed the president’s orders.

julie hirschfeld davis

And basically got the information that they needed and the predicate for laying out a case against President Trump that could be grounds for impeachment.

archived recording We are going to House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff with a news conference on the impeachment committee report.

michael barbaro

Which brings us to Tuesday.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. So on Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee was ready to release its report and send it over to the House Judiciary Committee. So they put together this 300-page report, lots of footnotes, release it publicly. And then Adam Schiff, the committee chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) Good afternoon.

julie hirschfeld davis

— goes to the press gallery in the Capitol and lays it all out.

archived recording (adam schiff) This report chronicles a scheme by the president of the United States to coerce an ally, Ukraine, that is at war with an adversary, Russia, into doing the president’s political dirty work. It involves a scheme in which Donald Trump withheld official acts, a White House meeting, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military assistance, in order to compel that power to deliver two investigations that he believed would assist his re-election campaign.

julie hirschfeld davis

And he raises this question again of whether people should have to accept that this is conduct that the president is allowed to engage in, and essentially lays out the predicate for what they’re going to give to the Judiciary Committee.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I’m happy to respond to your questions.

julie hirschfeld davis

Then Schiff takes questions from reporters, and the first question is about, essentially, the only really new thing that is not familiar to people who watched the hearings.

archived recording When did you obtain the cell phone records that are in this report?

julie hirschfeld davis

And that is the cell phone records that show contact between Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, and various White House officials, including John Bolton, the former national security adviser, but also Devin Nunes, who is the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and his contacts with Lev Parnas, who is an associate of Rudy Giuliani, who was also pushing for the ouster of the Ukrainian ambassador, who the president wanted gone.

archived recording (adam schiff) But certainly the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.

michael barbaro

You’re telling me, though, that we just learned in this report that the leading Republican on the Intelligence Committee was communicating, and perhaps coordinating, with the White House and the president’s lawyer months ago, and communicating with key figures involved in the pressure campaign that that very committee he’s on is supposed to be investigating?

julie hirschfeld davis

Correct. It’s pretty stunning information, although we don’t know what was discussed in those calls. All we have is timestamps and phone numbers, and so it’s tough to reconstruct what the substance of those calls were. But it’s a pretty unusual situation all around.

archived recording (adam schiff) It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity.

michael barbaro

Julie, what’s your understanding of why, given the juiciness of what you just described, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of closing shop and handing all its work over to the Judiciary Committee, rather than continuing to figure out what just happened with Nunes and with everything else in the report?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, Schiff says that he basically is not closing up shop. There are still questions about these calls, and also other broader issues — like did this pressure campaign actually begin much earlier with the previous president of Ukraine? — that they still want answered. But what he says is that —

archived recording (adam schiff) There was more investigative work to be done. Even as we believe that we cannot wait because the president’s efforts to secure intervention in the next election persist, we continue our investigation and we will.

julie hirschfeld davis

The president’s efforts to get a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election are ongoing. And so we need to move. We need to get this thing going. And what he doesn’t say, but what is also the case, is that the outcome here is pretty much known, at least in the House. They are very likely to draft articles of impeachment, to vote them through, to send the matter to the Senate. And Democrats believe that they have the evidence that they need to do that, and so this is the moment, they think, to get this thing moving.

michael barbaro

And so now the work of the Judiciary Committee begins.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And on paper, they have a very simple and very somber task of taking this lengthy report and deciding whether this rises to the level of impeachable offenses, whether, under the Constitution, this is something that warrants the president’s removal. But remember, this is the Judiciary Committee. This is the messier, more partisan culture war committee, and nobody expects for this to be a very orderly or buttoned-down process.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Julie, the impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee. What makes it a messier place than the Intelligence Committee?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the rules of the Judiciary Committee are written for very different reasons than the rules of the Intelligence Committee are. They’re written to facilitate these freewheeling debates about policy and legislation and various matters that are of great interest to the public. So the minority has a lot of ability to interrupt the proceedings, to make points of order, to use parliamentary tactics to essentially make itself heard. Given that, and also given the members of the committee, it’s culturally a place of much more backing and forthing, and a pretty lively one.

michael barbaro

It feels like you’re saying that the best days of the impeachment inquiry for Democrats are now behind them.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it depends on your perspective. I think for some lawmakers, they have been waiting with great anticipation to have their moment to publicly say their piece about what they think about President Trump’s conduct, whether they’re Democrats and want to outline how egregiously horrible they think this has been, or Republicans and want to defend everything that the president has done. And for the rest of the Democratic caucus, I do think that there is some degree of worry that now is the part where things get really messy, where all of the talk of somber state debating goes out the window, and here we are in the Judiciary Committee having a food fight.

michael barbaro

Right. Nancy Pelosi is forever using this phrase. This is a “somber,” “prayerful” moment and process. And you’re saying it’s not going to be prayerful in that committee room.

julie hirschfeld davis

Probably will not look like most people’s image of prayerful.

michael barbaro

And what, specifically, will the Judiciary Committee be doing when it comes to determining the constitutionality of this impeachment inquiry?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, their first step is to hold a hearing today with constitutional scholars, who will basically testify about the history of impeachment, precedence for impeachment, and really what the definition is of an impeachable offense. And it’s not necessarily straightforward. It’s not straightforward at all. The Constitution doesn’t say very much about what a president or another official could be impeached for. There are certain phrases in there, like “high crimes and misdemeanors,” that have been hotly debated by legal scholars. So is a high crime a particularly egregious actual crime, or is it wrongdoing by a high official? That’s something that they’re going to have to work out. And on Tuesday, we saw the Democrats start to signal what their argument is going to be about, what counts as impeachable, and that it doesn’t have to be a crime. They quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Intelligence Committee report, explaining that impeachment is not only designed to cover criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. And they quote Hamilton saying, “The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They’re of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

michael barbaro

They don’t write like that anymore.

julie hirschfeld davis

No, for better or for worse.

michael barbaro

And is this always how the Judiciary Committee functions during an impeachment? I mean, calling constitutional scholars, professors, historians to basically ruminate on the very nature of what is impeachable?

archived recording The purpose of today’s hearing is to receive testimony from legal and constitutional scholars on the background and history of impeachment.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Judiciary Committee did do this same thing, back just before they started impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.

archived recording The most important question to this committee is the meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” It is important to remember that the word “high” in high crimes and misdemeanors was used to emphasize that it was a crime or misdemeanor against the commonwealth.

julie hirschfeld davis

And part of it is just laying out the reference points for them to be able to go back to to say, remember when these people who studied the Constitution and told us what it was all about and told us what impeachment was for said about what we should be considering? And so it’s a way for them to kind of give the public a concept of why they would be doing this.

michael barbaro

I get how the rules vary here in ways that would make the Judiciary Committee a messier process than the Intelligence Committee, but I’m honestly having a hard time imagining how interviewing constitutional scholars gets all that messy.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it has to do with what they’re interviewing the scholars about and the very, very different places that the Republicans and Democrats on the committee are coming from about that issue. They’re essentially going to be arguing over the Constitution and trying to compete with one another to elicit from these constitutional scholars the most favorable interpretation of what impeachment means and what the standard is for their side. So rather than arguing over who said what in a phone call with the Ukrainian president, or whether civil servants’ view of what President Trump did is legitimate or not legitimate, they’re actually going to be arguing over the Constitution itself and what those words, those few words that are in the Constitution about impeachment, actually mean in the context of what President Trump has done.

michael barbaro

Julie, you’ve said that it’s widely understood that the House is going to vote to impeach the president. That’s one of the reasons Schiff was in such a hurry to move this from the Intelligence Committee over to the Judiciary Committee. So what are these two different phases that you’ve been describing? Why do they ultimately matter? I mean, why does it matter that the Intelligence Committee ran this as a tightly controlled, buttoned-up process, and that it’s likely to get a lot messier in the Judiciary Committee, if we know the outcome of all this basically beforehand?

julie hirschfeld davis

Because I think there is a broader question of what does impeaching a president look like when it’s a purely partisan exercise? The Democrats opened this process with what was essentially a partisan vote to begin an impeachment inquiry. And if they engage now in a spectacle, in a sort of war, on the public stage over impeaching the president, they are very aware that they could lose whatever public support they do have for going forward with this, and that people could come away thinking that they have not been conscientious about what their constitutional duty is, that they’ve abused their positions and treated impeachment just like another partisan fight that they have with President Trump that essentially would trivialize the process, both in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of history. This is, after all, a process that’s enshrined in the Constitution, and Democrats don’t want to be the ones who are blamed with tainting that process and undermining it. So there is a real risk for them that in this realm that they’re about to enter, that they’re going to come off looking like less than they should.

michael barbaro

Right. They could undermine what the Intelligence Committee seemed to have pulled off, in part because of the rules that allowed for it, that gave the power to the majority, and therefore allowed them to conduct that first phase in a way that seemed kind of high-minded and, as Nancy Pelosi would say, prayerful.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. They largely hit their mark in the first phase of this inquiry, and now they are keenly aware that, having demonstrated to the public that they are taking this seriously, that they’re being disciplined about how they’re going about it, that they’re honoring the process, that it could all unravel.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. may lose the Iowa caucuses. But he is betting on strong support from black voters in Southern states and urban areas to help him accrue the 1,990 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.

It might work. That’s because an overwhelming majority of delegates are awarded from areas more racially diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire. If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests.

Think of it this way: Candidates gain delegates based on voting in both states and districts, which are Congressional districts in all but a few places. While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates.

A recent poll shows Mr. Biden at 44 percent among black voters in South Carolina, the early voting state with a majority-black Democratic electorate, and a historic harbinger for how the South will vote. The same poll had Mr. Biden’s next closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, trailing him by more than 30 percentage points among black voters.

Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham, Ala., who has yet to endorse a candidate, said national political analysts are underestimating the political advantages Mr. Biden enjoys in the South.

“It’s not that he’s weaker than people think,” Mr. Woodfin said. “He’s much stronger.”

In most states, districts are Congressional districts, but can be other boundaries. Texas, included in the graphic, uses state legislature districts. North Carolina districts may change, pending redistricting.

As the chart above shows, some of the most delegate-rich districts in Southern states like Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina have large shares of black Democratic voters. (Vermont is an exception; its population is largely white, but it has only one district with 11 Democratic delegates.)

Under party rules, more delegates are awarded in districts with high concentrations of Democrats. Because black people overwhelmingly vote Democratic, areas with many black residents tend to have higher numbers of Democratic delegates.

This is a big reason why black Democrats are so sought-after in the race for the party’s nomination. Historically, black Democratic primary voters have tended to back a single candidate, helping thrust the voting bloc to the forefront in Southern states where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate. If a single candidate can get huge vote margins with black Democrats, like Barack Obama did in 2008 and Hillary Clinton did in 2016, he or she can amass a big delegate lead over other candidates.

The last Democratic candidate to win the nomination without winning a majority of black voters was Michael Dukakis, then the governor of Massachusetts, in 1988; Rev. Jesse Jackson secured more of their support. In 2004, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts won the nomination with a slight majority of black votes, after battling with Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.

Cornell Belcher, the pollster who helped conduct much of Mr. Obama's South Carolina research, compared Mr. Biden’s support in black communities in the 2020 primary to the advantages Mrs. Clinton experienced early in 2008. However, he said, none of Mr. Biden’s rivals are replicating Mr. Obama’s robust black grass-roots program.

“If they were replicating what we did in 2007, they would already have the resources and infrastructure on the ground in South Carolina like we did,” he said. “If they were replicating what we did in ‘07, there would already be a Harris or Buttigieg barber shop and hair salon program in place on the grass-roots level that went under and around the black establishment in the state.”

The delegate calendar for the Democratic Party also shows the limitations of viewing the race through the prisms of the early states.

The vast majority of delegates awarded early in the race come on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 15 states and territories will hold their primaries and caucuses. More than 1,300 pledged delegates are awarded that day.

By the end of Super Tuesday, 38 percent of all the pledged delegates in 19 states and territories will have been allocated, making it difficult for candidates to build a voter coalition if they are not competitive by that point.

The candidates best positioned to overtake Mr. Biden’s voter coalition at this point — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mr. Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — each face challenges in attracting a diverse range of voters, albeit to varying degrees.

Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have shown some traction with younger, nonwhite voters. Mr. Sanders in particular has polled better among nonwhite voters than any candidate other than Mr. Biden, though he remains a distant second. He is also betting on an electoral strategy that will encourage those who sat out the 2016 primary to join the process, which supporters believe will help him grow his diverse coalition.

There are signs in California, the primary’s most delegate-rich state, that Ms. Warren can challenge Mr. Biden on more diverse territory. Ms. Warren has led some polls in the state, and her team says that a good showing in the early states can unlock more support, citing the backing of diverse progressive groups like the Working Families Party.

Mr. Buttigieg is a unique case. While he has shown significant momentum in Iowa, that support has yet to translate outside the first state. Unlike Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders he has been anemic with black voters — polling again at 0 percent in the latest South Carolina survey — and several high-profile errors have helped create a reputation that his campaign has a blindspot for nonwhite constituencies.

Without a reversal, Mr. Buttigieg risks joining a dubious list: Candidates who succeeded in Iowa and New Hampshire but nonetheless lost the Democratic nomination.

Most eventual Democratic nominees won Iowa or New Hampshire Year Eventual nominee Iowa New Hampshire 1972 George McGovern 1976 Jimmy Carter 1980 Jimmy Carter 1984 Walter Mondale 1988 Michael Dukakis 1992 Bill Clinton 2000 Al Gore 2004 John Kerry 2008 Barack Obama 2016 Hillary Clinton Sources: Des Moines Register, New York Times | Note: Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012 are excluded because they were incumbents with no significant challengers.

Some candidates who are struggling to break through Mr. Biden’s advantage with black voters have compared their plight to Mr. Obama’s; he won Iowa in 2008 and built a national coalition after. However, Mr. Belcher said that comparison should be scrutinized, considering Mr. Obama was much better positioned across the country than many of the candidates who likened themselves to him.

Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris of California, among others, are now banking on a breakthrough in Iowa to help propel them forward in the early states and compete with Mr. Biden among black voters in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday. Ms. Harris, for one, has been making direct appeals to black voters in the South.

“When we talk about black girl magic, we know that it is something special,” Ms. Harris told a crowd at Benedict College, a historically black institution in Columbia, S.C. “But that magic is born out of hard work.”

Mr. Belcher acknowledged that few 2020 candidates have the resources that were available to Mr. Obama in 2007, but he also said the campaigns have been guilty of “lazy thinking,” if they planned to wrest Mr. Biden’s black support simply by winning an early state.

“They are taking a key constituency that they need for granted,” he said."

Here’s His Strategy.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/politics/joe-biden-campaign-iowa.html,"This is the U.S. secretary of war in 1908, William Taft. One day, he decides that he wants a formal portrait of himself. The photographer arrives, but then the phone rings. He starts taking pictures anyway. On the phone is Taft’s friend Theodore Roosevelt, the president. It’s a long conversation, but suddenly, the photographer lucks out. Taft learns that Roosevelt’s chosen him to run for president as his successor. It’s a good choice. Taft goes on to the campaign trail and wins. It’s an historic win because, even though he’s the 27th president, he’s only the first president to win after running a big nationwide campaign tour. Before him, presidential candidates were expected to stay quiet, sit at home. Several decades later — [Music playing] So how did we get here, from a time when personally campaigning for president was unheard of to — We’ll start in 1789. George Washington becomes America’s first president. The founders are hell-bent on making sure a president can’t accumulate too much power. Remember, they just kicked out a king. They don’t want another one of those. They want a president to be humble, like the George Washington depicted here as a simple farmer. If a candidate goes directly to the public, campaigns for themself and asks for votes, it could be a warning sign. They may be power-hungry, a wannabe English king in waiting. “The office must seek the man, not the man the office,” one historian explained. Basically, today’s campaigning would seem very sketchy indeed. Anyway, Washington sets the tone. He’s careful not to appear at all like he wants the presidency. He’s there out of duty. Washington’s example will loom large over presidential candidates for the next century, even as the country quickly changes. This is a political cartoon from 1852. That’s a presidential candidate. That’s a political party boss. And that’s the candidate’s mouth, kept shut. As the country grows, political parties also grow. They choose who the candidates will be and they do all the campaigning on the candidate’s behalf. The candidates, well, they’re expected to stay reserved, Washington-like, mouth shut. But occasionally, candidates campaign anyway. And they’re the ones who slowly chip away at tradition. Let’s go to 1860 for one glaring example. Abraham Lincoln is running against three others for the presidency. One of them decides to throw precedence out the window. Stephen Douglas, a man who’s in danger of losing, decides to go on a big campaign tour. But because of tradition, he can’t just come out and say what he’s doing. So Douglas makes excuses. He says the tour is in order to see his mother in upstate New York, visit his childhood home in Vermont, and watch his brother-in-law graduate from Harvard. Along the way, he makes campaign speeches, and gets heaps of criticism for doing so. The New York Times writes that the presidency is “too high to be reached by a mere stump speaker, and too dignified to be canvassed for like a county clerkship or a seat in Congress.” Douglas, of course, loses, but the size of his stumping tour is another step towards public campaigning. Things will loosen up a bit more, quite by accident, on a front porch in Ohio two decades later. Meanwhile, the political parties have gotten so big and so corrupt there’s a backlash against them. Americans want to interact more with the candidates directly, without the party machines getting in the way. Enter Republican nominee James Garfield. He’s planned to spend the election of 1880 laying low at his home in Ohio, just as candidates usually do. But then, people keep showing up at his house. They want to see their candidate in person. Garfield’s got to say something. He can’t just ignore them. So he gives a bunch of short speeches from his front porch. Garfield has stumbled on a way to personally campaign without risking criticism by going on some big campaign tour. He just does it from home and says it’s because people just showed up. He wins. But this doesn’t turn the tide entirely. 16 years later, however, there’s an upset at the Democratic National Convention. An obscure Nebraska congressman is nominated for president, William Jennings Bryan. He’s so polarizing that many in his party won’t campaign for him. That means Bryan has to do it himself, which is fine, because his whole persona is being a voice for the common people against powerful institutions. It makes sense that he’d ignore political traditions and instead speak to voters himself. He covers 27 states. His opponent, William McKinley, on the other hand, doesn’t hit the road. He takes a page from Garfield’s book, and give speeches from his own front porch. “My fellow citizens —” But it’s all much grander this time. There are parades out front. 750,000 people come to visit. Both strategies are extreme for the time, but McKinley’s is safer. One way to look at what’s going on here is with this pro-McKinley cartoon. It plays up their age difference. McKinley served in the Civil War when Bryan was still a baby. Bryan is now 36, part of a whole new generation. He’s less connected to the colonial traditions that kept candidates at a distance from the public. McKinley ends up winning anyway, but when they have a rematch for president four years later, McKinley doesn’t actively campaign for re-election because now McKinley is a president. And damn the winds of change, remember, the presidency is too sacred an office to use for campaigning. Enter the man so consumed with the limelight that his daughter once said he wanted to be “the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral.” Teddy Roosevelt, McKinley’s running mate. No one said vice presidential candidates can’t stump. As Bryan and Roosevelt go at it in 1900, we see two young, brash candidates drawing crowds with their charisma. Or as historian Gil Troy puts it, they “helped bury a century-old tradition of candidate passivity.” And then four years later, the man who loves a crowd, now President Teddy Roosevelt, falls silent when it’s time to run for his re-election. Presidents still mustn’t campaign. Now is when we come to William Taft, whose big smile we saw at the beginning. And I want to use this image to explain what happens during the election of 1908. On the right is a Taft mannequin. On the left is a William Jennings Bryan mannequin. He’s running again, for a third time. Let’s look closer. There’s a phonograph playing pre-recorded speeches by the candidates. Signs encourage voters to also hear the candidates’ rebuttals to each other. It’s even assumed that voters will pay money to hear all this. That’s how far American norms have shifted in the new century. They expect a more direct democracy with accessible candidates. Now the funny thing about this is, is that Taft is totally against this idea at first. He’s more keen on staying old-school and holding a front porch campaign. No one really shows up. But with Bryan on the road getting all the attention and Taft’s allies pushing him to do the same, he doesn’t have a choice. This is how it works now. He hits the campaign trail, literally following in the footsteps of Bryan. It goes great. He wins. Historian Richard Ellis notes that Taft “helped erase the association between stumping and losing.” Like I said at the beginning, the first president to be elected after making a full campaign tour. It’s not like there’s something about Taft that makes him the first president to stump mightily and win. It’s the combination of incremental changes in American society and behaviors by earlier candidates. If we zip ahead to 1944, we can look back and see just how far things have come. It’s Franklin Roosevelt’s last campaign. At one point, he gets driven 50 miles through the streets of New York City, in an open car, in winter. “And a great welcome from all the boroughs.” An incumbent president pleading his case to the public for a fourth term. The campaigns, the rallies, they all just become part of seeking the presidency. So when you watch presidential candidates on the campaign trail, sitting in diners, riding in buses, shaking hands and taking selfies, and crowd surfing, it’s not quite what the founders intended, but it’s what the people demanded. [Cheering] So five minutes into the video, we talked about President McKinley’s famous front porch campaign. Turns out McKinley is famous for another type of public appearance. His two inaugurations were the first to ever be recorded by a moving picture camera. If you look closely, you can see the chief justice of the Supreme Court raising his hand to give the oath of office. Consequently, McKinley’s was the first presidential funeral to also be filmed. He was assassinated during his second term."

After I wrote a column a couple of months ago about the promise and disappointment of Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, one Times reader from Boston left a comment that I thought was particularly smart. “Prosecutors rarely translate well when it comes to governing at the executive level,” the reader wrote. “Their default mode is neither policy nor the long view.”

Harris came up through California politics as a prosecutor. And she never seemed to develop a clear theory of how to use government to improve people’s lives. Barack Obama, who worked as a state legislator, did develop such a theory. So did Bill Clinton, who started as a prosecutor but then spent years as a governor. So has Elizabeth Warren, who came from academia.

An especially interesting contrast this year is Pete Buttigieg, whose résumé is less impressive than Harris’s and who, in my view, isn’t as charismatic as she is. But when I listen to Buttigieg describe his vision, I understand it. His time as a mayor of a small city shaped that vision, much as it did for Bernie Sanders decades earlier. With Harris, I was never quite sure what her vision was. Her vaguely titled memoir (“The Truths We Hold”) and oddly flat campaign slogans (like “Justice Is on the Ballot”) captured the problem."

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The House Intelligence Committee has released its impeachment report to the Judiciary Committee, signaling the end of one phase of impeachment and the beginning of another. Julie Davis on why those two phases will look so different. It’s Wednesday, December 4. Julie, tell me about these two phases of the House impeachment inquiry.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the House Intelligence Committee has just finished its report and completed its work, and now the House Judiciary Committee has its job to do. And these are two very different committees. The House Intelligence Committee is a very buttoned-up, frequently less partisan place. They deal in matters of intelligence. They oversee the intelligence community. They deal in state secrets, and because of that —

archived recording (mike rogers) Committee has been extensively briefed on these efforts over a regular basis as a part of our ongoing oversight responsibility.

julie hirschfeld davis

— it attracts the workhorse members who are into dealing with long reports, really meaty, substantive issues, oftentimes behind closed doors, not in front of the news cameras.

archived recording (mike rogers) Ranking member and I believe it is important to hold an open hearing today, and we don’t do a tremendous amount of those.

julie hirschfeld davis

Dilatory tactics, parliamentary stunts — that sort of thing just doesn’t happen that often in the Intelligence Committee, because that’s just not what they’re about.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) The Judiciary Committee will come to order, and without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.

julie hirschfeld davis

The Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is kind of known for that. And the Judiciary Committee oversees the federal courts and the Justice Department, but it also has jurisdiction over cultural hot button issues.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) We welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on “Planned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s Largest Abortion Provider.”

julie hirschfeld davis

It has jurisdiction over questions of abortion rights, over gun rights —

archived recording (lucy mcbath) I ask my colleagues on this committee, both Republicans and Democrats, to stand up with me in supporting this legislation. We have to save lives.

julie hirschfeld davis

— some of the things that typically draw the most fervent responses from both parties. And so it attracts members who want to engage in that level of really partisan debate — people who really seek out the spotlight, who want to engage in culture war type of subjects that come before the Judiciary Committee, they sort of excel in these very highly partisan public debates. These debates that happen in the Judiciary Committee are typically much more raucous, much more freewheeling, and it’s a much more partisan place.

michael barbaro

So crude summary here. The Intelligence Committee is dominated by rule-oriented leaders, the workhorses. The Judiciary Committee is more dominated by cultural warriors, the show horses.

julie hirschfeld davis

That’s right. And to be clear, there is some overlap between the two committees. There are people who serve on both committees. And it’s not like everyone on the Judiciary Committee is guns blazing, culture warrior, and everyone on the Intelligence Committee is a dry consumer of long intelligence reports.

michael barbaro

[CHUCKLES]

julie hirschfeld davis

But that is the profile of these two committees, and those tend to be the sorts of people who seek out seats on the Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, so there is kind of a cultural difference there.

michael barbaro

So explain how these different roles of these two committees are actually playing out in this impeachment inquiry. Let’s start with the Intelligence Committee, since its work has just been completed. How has its broader role, its rules and its mission reflected in the work of the impeachment inquiry over the past few weeks?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Intelligence Committee is used to working in secret, working in a setting where you’re controlling the flow of information. Because by definition, they’re dealing with intelligence matters, and that can’t be debated freely on the House floor in the halls. And its procedures also reflect that. There is less opportunity for the minority party to shut down the proceedings, because if they were allowed to do that, that could be dangerous. I mean, that has actual implications, potentially, for national security. So the very rules of the committee they’re used to operating under are just tighter by definition. And you saw Adam Schiff, the chairman of the committee, really using that to his advantage when it came to controlling the witness list, having a say in who Republicans would be able to call as public witnesses.

michael barbaro

Right.

julie hirschfeld davis

So Republicans, for instance, wanted to call Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, which — Democrats knew that that would be a red herring. And so they did not sign off on calling Hunter Biden. They did allow Republicans to call some witnesses. We saw them call Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, who was a former National Security Council official. So they didn’t shut them down altogether, but again, the committee operates in this way where the rights of the minority are proscribed such that they can’t just do anything they want whenever they want.

michael barbaro

And what about the witnesses who the Democrats wanted to call? How did they use the Intelligence Committee’s rules to their advantage?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, they were very careful to design a process where the lawyers for each side would be doing, or could be doing, the bulk of the questioning. So that was a concerted move on the part of Adam Schiff, the chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) We’ll now move to the 45-minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes.

julie hirschfeld davis

— to have long, substantive rounds of, essentially, evidence gathering, taking the testimony and laying it out in a public way, rather than having lawmakers take turns and have it be a free-for-all of people trying to get their five minutes of soundbites in. And then when Republicans did try to upend things —

archived recording (devin nunes) I know, Ms. Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. I’ll yield to you, Ms. Stefanik. archived recording (elise stefanik) Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend.

julie hirschfeld davis

— Schiff really shut them down. There was a moment, a couple of hearings in, where Elise Stefanik, Republican congresswoman from New York, who Republicans wanted to spotlight, particularly because that day, they were hearing from a female witness, the former Ukraine ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. And they knew they were going to be accused of berating her and hammering at her, and she’s a woman and sort of mansplaining her. And so they really wanted Stefanik to have the spotlight.

archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. archived recording (elise stefanik) What is the interruption for this time? It is our time — archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized. Mr. Nunes, you are minority counsel — archived recording (devin nunes) I just recognized — archived recording (adam schiff) Under the House Resolution 660, you are not allowed to yield time except to minority counsel. archived recording (elise stefanik) The ranking member yielded time to another member of Congress. archived recording (adam schiff) No.

julie hirschfeld davis

They tried to yield time to her, and Schiff just shut it down.

archived recording (devin nunes) You’re gagging the young lady from New York? archived recording (elise stefanik) That is accurate. Ambassador Yovanovitch, I want to thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) Gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized.

michael barbaro

Right, and the rules would protect this sort of thing, theoretically, so that a member of the minority party on the Intelligence Committee wouldn’t, say, bring up the location of American C.I.A. agents overseas.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And granted, these issues that were coming up in the impeachment hearings were not strictly intelligence matters. There wasn’t necessarily a risk that anyone was going to go blabbing about black sites, but the rules that they were using were designed for those sorts of things. And so we saw Chairman Schiff take pretty good advantage of that.

michael barbaro

Right. Not that a bookish member of the Intelligence Committee would ever do such a thing, but just in case.

julie hirschfeld davis

Just in case.

michael barbaro

So the Republicans kind of get sidelined in this process because of these rules and the way the committee enforces them. What was the outcome for the Democrats who were overseeing this?

Well, the outcome was very much as they had hoped it would be. They really were able to use the process to get what they needed out of the witnesses that they called.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting? The answer is yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

They laid out this narrative —

archived recording (adam schiff) It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.

julie hirschfeld davis

We were following the president’s orders.

archived recording (gordon sondland) So we followed the president’s orders.

julie hirschfeld davis

And basically got the information that they needed and the predicate for laying out a case against President Trump that could be grounds for impeachment.

archived recording We are going to House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff with a news conference on the impeachment committee report.

michael barbaro

Which brings us to Tuesday.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. So on Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee was ready to release its report and send it over to the House Judiciary Committee. So they put together this 300-page report, lots of footnotes, release it publicly. And then Adam Schiff, the committee chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) Good afternoon.

julie hirschfeld davis

— goes to the press gallery in the Capitol and lays it all out.

archived recording (adam schiff) This report chronicles a scheme by the president of the United States to coerce an ally, Ukraine, that is at war with an adversary, Russia, into doing the president’s political dirty work. It involves a scheme in which Donald Trump withheld official acts, a White House meeting, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military assistance, in order to compel that power to deliver two investigations that he believed would assist his re-election campaign.

julie hirschfeld davis

And he raises this question again of whether people should have to accept that this is conduct that the president is allowed to engage in, and essentially lays out the predicate for what they’re going to give to the Judiciary Committee.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I’m happy to respond to your questions.

julie hirschfeld davis

Then Schiff takes questions from reporters, and the first question is about, essentially, the only really new thing that is not familiar to people who watched the hearings.

archived recording When did you obtain the cell phone records that are in this report?

julie hirschfeld davis

And that is the cell phone records that show contact between Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, and various White House officials, including John Bolton, the former national security adviser, but also Devin Nunes, who is the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and his contacts with Lev Parnas, who is an associate of Rudy Giuliani, who was also pushing for the ouster of the Ukrainian ambassador, who the president wanted gone.

archived recording (adam schiff) But certainly the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.

michael barbaro

You’re telling me, though, that we just learned in this report that the leading Republican on the Intelligence Committee was communicating, and perhaps coordinating, with the White House and the president’s lawyer months ago, and communicating with key figures involved in the pressure campaign that that very committee he’s on is supposed to be investigating?

julie hirschfeld davis

Correct. It’s pretty stunning information, although we don’t know what was discussed in those calls. All we have is timestamps and phone numbers, and so it’s tough to reconstruct what the substance of those calls were. But it’s a pretty unusual situation all around.

archived recording (adam schiff) It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity.

michael barbaro

Julie, what’s your understanding of why, given the juiciness of what you just described, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of closing shop and handing all its work over to the Judiciary Committee, rather than continuing to figure out what just happened with Nunes and with everything else in the report?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, Schiff says that he basically is not closing up shop. There are still questions about these calls, and also other broader issues — like did this pressure campaign actually begin much earlier with the previous president of Ukraine? — that they still want answered. But what he says is that —

archived recording (adam schiff) There was more investigative work to be done. Even as we believe that we cannot wait because the president’s efforts to secure intervention in the next election persist, we continue our investigation and we will.

julie hirschfeld davis

The president’s efforts to get a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election are ongoing. And so we need to move. We need to get this thing going. And what he doesn’t say, but what is also the case, is that the outcome here is pretty much known, at least in the House. They are very likely to draft articles of impeachment, to vote them through, to send the matter to the Senate. And Democrats believe that they have the evidence that they need to do that, and so this is the moment, they think, to get this thing moving.

michael barbaro

And so now the work of the Judiciary Committee begins.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And on paper, they have a very simple and very somber task of taking this lengthy report and deciding whether this rises to the level of impeachable offenses, whether, under the Constitution, this is something that warrants the president’s removal. But remember, this is the Judiciary Committee. This is the messier, more partisan culture war committee, and nobody expects for this to be a very orderly or buttoned-down process.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Julie, the impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee. What makes it a messier place than the Intelligence Committee?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the rules of the Judiciary Committee are written for very different reasons than the rules of the Intelligence Committee are. They’re written to facilitate these freewheeling debates about policy and legislation and various matters that are of great interest to the public. So the minority has a lot of ability to interrupt the proceedings, to make points of order, to use parliamentary tactics to essentially make itself heard. Given that, and also given the members of the committee, it’s culturally a place of much more backing and forthing, and a pretty lively one.

michael barbaro

It feels like you’re saying that the best days of the impeachment inquiry for Democrats are now behind them.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it depends on your perspective. I think for some lawmakers, they have been waiting with great anticipation to have their moment to publicly say their piece about what they think about President Trump’s conduct, whether they’re Democrats and want to outline how egregiously horrible they think this has been, or Republicans and want to defend everything that the president has done. And for the rest of the Democratic caucus, I do think that there is some degree of worry that now is the part where things get really messy, where all of the talk of somber state debating goes out the window, and here we are in the Judiciary Committee having a food fight.

michael barbaro

Right. Nancy Pelosi is forever using this phrase. This is a “somber,” “prayerful” moment and process. And you’re saying it’s not going to be prayerful in that committee room.

julie hirschfeld davis

Probably will not look like most people’s image of prayerful.

michael barbaro

And what, specifically, will the Judiciary Committee be doing when it comes to determining the constitutionality of this impeachment inquiry?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, their first step is to hold a hearing today with constitutional scholars, who will basically testify about the history of impeachment, precedence for impeachment, and really what the definition is of an impeachable offense. And it’s not necessarily straightforward. It’s not straightforward at all. The Constitution doesn’t say very much about what a president or another official could be impeached for. There are certain phrases in there, like “high crimes and misdemeanors,” that have been hotly debated by legal scholars. So is a high crime a particularly egregious actual crime, or is it wrongdoing by a high official? That’s something that they’re going to have to work out. And on Tuesday, we saw the Democrats start to signal what their argument is going to be about, what counts as impeachable, and that it doesn’t have to be a crime. They quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Intelligence Committee report, explaining that impeachment is not only designed to cover criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. And they quote Hamilton saying, “The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They’re of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

michael barbaro

They don’t write like that anymore.

julie hirschfeld davis

No, for better or for worse.

michael barbaro

And is this always how the Judiciary Committee functions during an impeachment? I mean, calling constitutional scholars, professors, historians to basically ruminate on the very nature of what is impeachable?

archived recording The purpose of today’s hearing is to receive testimony from legal and constitutional scholars on the background and history of impeachment.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Judiciary Committee did do this same thing, back just before they started impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.

archived recording The most important question to this committee is the meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” It is important to remember that the word “high” in high crimes and misdemeanors was used to emphasize that it was a crime or misdemeanor against the commonwealth.

julie hirschfeld davis

And part of it is just laying out the reference points for them to be able to go back to to say, remember when these people who studied the Constitution and told us what it was all about and told us what impeachment was for said about what we should be considering? And so it’s a way for them to kind of give the public a concept of why they would be doing this.

michael barbaro

I get how the rules vary here in ways that would make the Judiciary Committee a messier process than the Intelligence Committee, but I’m honestly having a hard time imagining how interviewing constitutional scholars gets all that messy.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it has to do with what they’re interviewing the scholars about and the very, very different places that the Republicans and Democrats on the committee are coming from about that issue. They’re essentially going to be arguing over the Constitution and trying to compete with one another to elicit from these constitutional scholars the most favorable interpretation of what impeachment means and what the standard is for their side. So rather than arguing over who said what in a phone call with the Ukrainian president, or whether civil servants’ view of what President Trump did is legitimate or not legitimate, they’re actually going to be arguing over the Constitution itself and what those words, those few words that are in the Constitution about impeachment, actually mean in the context of what President Trump has done.

michael barbaro

Julie, you’ve said that it’s widely understood that the House is going to vote to impeach the president. That’s one of the reasons Schiff was in such a hurry to move this from the Intelligence Committee over to the Judiciary Committee. So what are these two different phases that you’ve been describing? Why do they ultimately matter? I mean, why does it matter that the Intelligence Committee ran this as a tightly controlled, buttoned-up process, and that it’s likely to get a lot messier in the Judiciary Committee, if we know the outcome of all this basically beforehand?

julie hirschfeld davis

Because I think there is a broader question of what does impeaching a president look like when it’s a purely partisan exercise? The Democrats opened this process with what was essentially a partisan vote to begin an impeachment inquiry. And if they engage now in a spectacle, in a sort of war, on the public stage over impeaching the president, they are very aware that they could lose whatever public support they do have for going forward with this, and that people could come away thinking that they have not been conscientious about what their constitutional duty is, that they’ve abused their positions and treated impeachment just like another partisan fight that they have with President Trump that essentially would trivialize the process, both in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of history. This is, after all, a process that’s enshrined in the Constitution, and Democrats don’t want to be the ones who are blamed with tainting that process and undermining it. So there is a real risk for them that in this realm that they’re about to enter, that they’re going to come off looking like less than they should.

michael barbaro

Right. They could undermine what the Intelligence Committee seemed to have pulled off, in part because of the rules that allowed for it, that gave the power to the majority, and therefore allowed them to conduct that first phase in a way that seemed kind of high-minded and, as Nancy Pelosi would say, prayerful.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. They largely hit their mark in the first phase of this inquiry, and now they are keenly aware that, having demonstrated to the public that they are taking this seriously, that they’re being disciplined about how they’re going about it, that they’re honoring the process, that it could all unravel.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who began her presidential campaign as a top-tier candidate with record crowds, has dropped out of the race —

Telegenic, highly educated and from a multiethnic background, she would have been an ideal candidate in the pre-Obama era. We expected her to create an All-American narrative that is relatable to a wide cross-section of the country; that’s how President Barack Obama ascended in 2004. But Ms. Harris failed to do that.

As we write eulogies of this once promising campaign, which ended on Tuesday, it is important that we talk about more than just personal failings by Ms. Harris and her staff members. We need to talk also about what campaigning looks like for black women and what challenges and hurdles the Harris campaign laid bare. There are biases and structural disadvantages that can be found in the subtle ways the media and the public responded to her candidacy.

Ms. Harris entered the race after having been elected to multiple statewide offices in California, a difficult hurdle for black candidates but especially black women. It was a sign that she could attract support from a diverse set of voters and raise a significant amount of money, both necessary for a viable presidential bid. That she did this in a large blue state was also a selling point.

But from the beginning, Ms. Harris struggled with her personal narrative. I first saw this in February at a rally for black women hosted by the Democratic strategist Leah Daughtry. A room full of hundreds of black women, even in their skepticism, wanted Ms. Harris to be excellent and were open to being persuaded. Yet, in the end, there was more doubt about her ability to secure the support of black voters, with whom she shared a racial identity. Since then, I’ve seen her at other public events, and it seemed as if she wasn’t sure which story would be compelling — the California prosecutor, the Obama-esque candidate, the child-of-immigrants success story. She tried them all, but it was alienating for those watching."

Ms. Harris, a graduate of Howard University an H.B.C.U. in Washington, proposed $70 billion for H.B.C.U.s in a plan she announced over the summer, with a particular focus on STEM education as well. (On Tuesday, Ms. Harris dropped out of the presidential race.)

Ms. Warren committed to investing a minimum of $50 billion into H.B.C.U.s, paid for by her wealth tax proposal, within her overarching plan to make public college free and to cancel most student loan debt. She said she would seek to increase the budget with her secretary of education to ensure equity in spending per student compared with other colleges in a given area.

Mr. Sanders, who also proposed universal free public college and canceling all student loan debt, pledged to make similar investments in H.B.C.U.s with a focus on educating teachers and those in the medical field. In addition, Mr. Sanders also proposed canceling the $1.6 billion in existing loan debt H.B.C.U.s face through the current Capital Financing Program.

Last month, Mr. Buttigieg wrote an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun, also promising to invest $50 billion in H.B.C.U.s.

Mr. Biden proposed more than $70 billion in investments for H.B.C.U.s, with dedicated funds to specific needs, such as $10 billion to create at least 200 new research incubators, $20 billion in high tech labs, facilities and digital infrastructure and another $18 billion in grants to help with tuition at four-year colleges , equivalent to up to two years of tuition per low-income and middle-class student s.

Ms. Warren forecasts she can raise more than $2 trillion solely by cracking down on companies that underpay their American tax liability.

Mr. Biden “is committed to being transparent with the American people about the smart and effective ways he’d pay for the bold changes he’s proposing,” said his policy director, Stef Feldman. “He believes that being forthright with voters about how plans would be financed is critical to building the public support necessary to beat Donald Trump, help more Democrats win up and down the ballot, and then pass legislation through Congress.”

Some high-earners — those who make around $450,000 a year — would pay lower tax rates under Mr. Biden’s plan than they did during the Obama administration, when Mr. Biden was vice president. That is a deliberate choice by Mr. Biden: He proposes returning the top income tax bracket to 39.6 percent, after Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax law cut it to 37 percent.

But Mr. Biden would only subject individuals’ income above $510,000 to that top rate. Before the Trump tax cuts, the top rate started at just under $420,000 for individuals.

Mr. Biden would also repeal a limitation that the Trump tax law placed on the deduction of state and local taxes from federal taxes. The law capped the so-called SALT deduction at $10,000 for individuals or households, a change that raised taxes on some higher-earning taxpayers in high-tax and predominantly Democratic states like California, New York and New Jersey.

Corporations would also be subject to a lower rate under Mr. Biden’s plan than they were before the passage of Mr. Trump’s tax cuts. The 2017 cuts reduced the corporate rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent. Mr. Biden would raise it to 28 percent — the same rate Mr. Obama proposed in a tax overhaul plan he was unable to push through as president.

Mr. Biden would unambiguously raise taxes on millionaires, and not just by lifting the top rate. He would raise the tax rate on capital gains — the proceeds from the sale of a stock, vacation home or other investment asset — to 39.6 percent from 23.8 percent, for taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year. He would also limit those taxpayers’ itemized deductions and eliminate an inflation adjustment at death that reduces capital gains liabilities for wealthy heirs."

That effort in turn has led to the impeachment proceedings in the House against the president."

Ah, but there’s the rub: All this overspending creates a lot of employment — and moving toward a more efficient and equitable health care system will inevitably mean getting rid of many administrative jobs. One study suggests that about 1.8 million jobs would be rendered unnecessary if America adopted a public health care financing system.

So what if some of these jobs involve debt collection, claims denial, aggressive legal action or are otherwise punitive, cruel or simply morally indefensible in a society that can clearly afford to provide high-quality health care to everyone? Jobs are jobs, folks, as Joe Biden might say.

Indeed, that’s exactly what Biden’s presidential campaign is saying about the Medicare for all plans that Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing: They “will not only cost 160 million Americans their private health coverage and force tax increases on the middle class, but it would also kill almost two million jobs,” a Biden campaign official warned recently.

Note the word “kill” in the statement. That word might better describe not what could happen to jobs under Medicare for all but what the health care industry is doing to many Americans today.

Last week, the medical journal JAMA published a comprehensive study examining the cause of a remarkably grim statistic about our national well-being. From 1959 to 2010, life expectancy in the United States and in other wealthy countries around the world climbed. Then, in 2014, American life expectancy began to fall, while it continued to rise elsewhere.

What caused the American decline? Researchers identified a number of potential factors, including tobacco use, obesity and psychological stress, but two of the leading causes can be pinned directly on the peculiarities and dysfunctions of American health care.

The first is the opioid epidemic, whose rise can be traced to the release, in 1996, of the prescription pain drug OxyContin. In the public narrative, much of the blame for the epidemic has been cast on the Sackler family, whose firm, Purdue Pharma, created OxyContin and pushed for its widespread use. But research has shown that the Sacklers exploited aberrant incentives in American health care."

After I wrote a column a couple of months ago about the promise and disappointment of Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, one Times reader from Boston left a comment that I thought was particularly smart. “Prosecutors rarely translate well when it comes to governing at the executive level,” the reader wrote. “Their default mode is neither policy nor the long view.”

Harris came up through California politics as a prosecutor. And she never seemed to develop a clear theory of how to use government to improve people’s lives. Barack Obama, who worked as a state legislator, did develop such a theory. So did Bill Clinton, who started as a prosecutor but then spent years as a governor. So has Elizabeth Warren, who came from academia.

An especially interesting contrast this year is Pete Buttigieg, whose résumé is less impressive than Harris’s and who, in my view, isn’t as charismatic as she is. But when I listen to Buttigieg describe his vision, I understand it. His time as a mayor of a small city shaped that vision, much as it did for Bernie Sanders decades earlier. With Harris, I was never quite sure what her vision was. Her vaguely titled memoir (“The Truths We Hold”) and oddly flat campaign slogans (like “Justice Is on the Ballot”) captured the problem."

It is hard to look at this field of candidates and not remember a cascading list of missteps. And many of them have things in their past for which they have apologized. But one question is why missteps are fatal to some campaigns and not others.

It is fair to ask what role racism and sexism played in her campaign’s demise. These are two “isms” that are permanent, obvious and unavoidable in American society.

It is fair to ask how those features impacted media coverage, or the lack of coverage.

It is fair to ask about the Democratic debate rules and how they prioritize donations in addition to polls, thereby advantaging the opinions of people who can afford to give over those who can’t.

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

Telegenic, highly educated and from a multiethnic background, she would have been an ideal candidate in the pre-Obama era. We expected her to create an All-American narrative that is relatable to a wide cross-section of the country; that’s how President Barack Obama ascended in 2004. But Ms. Harris failed to do that.

As we write eulogies of this once promising campaign, which ended on Tuesday, it is important that we talk about more than just personal failings by Ms. Harris and her staff members. We need to talk also about what campaigning looks like for black women and what challenges and hurdles the Harris campaign laid bare. There are biases and structural disadvantages that can be found in the subtle ways the media and the public responded to her candidacy.

Ms. Harris entered the race after having been elected to multiple statewide offices in California, a difficult hurdle for black candidates but especially black women. It was a sign that she could attract support from a diverse set of voters and raise a significant amount of money, both necessary for a viable presidential bid. That she did this in a large blue state was also a selling point.

But from the beginning, Ms. Harris struggled with her personal narrative. I first saw this in February at a rally for black women hosted by the Democratic strategist Leah Daughtry. A room full of hundreds of black women, even in their skepticism, wanted Ms. Harris to be excellent and were open to being persuaded. Yet, in the end, there was more doubt about her ability to secure the support of black voters, with whom she shared a racial identity. Since then, I’ve seen her at other public events, and it seemed as if she wasn’t sure which story would be compelling — the California prosecutor, the Obama-esque candidate, the child-of-immigrants success story. She tried them all, but it was alienating for those watching."

Our debate criteria reflects this.”

Leah D. Daughtry, a longtime Democratic National Committee member who sits on the party’s rules committee, said she’s had a number of conversations in recent days with other members about how to change the system to include more candidates of color. No one has come up with a workable solution.

“I don’t know how you fix it now without upsetting the apple cart,” she said. “But it’s a problem. It’s a real problem.”

Some prominent Democrats say the party cannot be blamed for the failure of candidates of color to make the stage, placing responsibility on their inability to build momentum for their efforts — particularly among black and Latino voters.

A growing number of voters, especially younger black voters, have rejected the notion that mere representation equals the kind of change the Democratic base is hungry for. Polls have consistently shown the former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. leading among African-American voters, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is widely popular among Latinos.

“When people make the case that the standards and requirements should be lowered so that candidates of color can make the debate, as a Latina, I find that insulting,” said Maria Cardona, a former D.N.C. official. “The reason why the candidates right now are the ones at the top of the polls are because these are the candidates who are getting the majority of support from, guess who, voters of color.”

In the 1980s, he created the Bloomberg Terminal, a financial tool for investors that would make him a billionaire. And in 2001, Bloomberg ran for mayor of New York City as a Republican. “That should make a great politician.” Then in the middle of his campaign, New York City changed forever on Sept. 11. As New York’s outgoing mayor took the national stage, he gave Bloomberg the thumbs up. “Well, I’m urging people to vote for Mike Bloomberg.” “I, Michael R. Bloomberg —” Bloomberg won. One of his priorities as mayor was tackling public health. “Sixty-four ounce. Just think about that.” “Don’t go near these things.” He also pushed for controversial stop-and-frisk policies that disproportionately affected minority communities. “Everything the New York City Police Department has done is absolutely —is legal.” But just days before entering the presidential race this year, he apologized. “I just want you to know that I realize back then, I was wrong.” In 2007, he left the G.O.P. And in 2008, during the financial crisis, he asked the City Council to extend term limits in order to let him run for a controversial third term. “Yes.” “No.” “No.” “Aye.” “Aye.” The vote passed, and he won re-election. “We’re going to make the next four years the best yet.” So what about the issues? After he left office in 2013, Bloomberg went back to running his company, which includes a news division. But he’s also focused on supporting candidates … “Let’s elect a sane, competent person.” … and causes he cares about, many of which are now key parts of his platform. Bloomberg is a vocal supporter of gun reform. “We cannot have a society where you go out in the street, and you can get blown away. We just have to say enough is enough.” He also has big plans for health care reform and fighting climate change. “Trump has done us a favor. Every time he riles against climate change, the money comes flooding in.” Overall, Bloomberg is positioning himself as a moderate in the Democratic field. “With the right candidate, we can turn areas from red to blue.” So what about his chances? They’re somewhat unknown. As a billionaire and fellow New Yorker, Bloomberg supporters feel he is uniquely positioned to take on President Trump. “I’m a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.” “There is nobody I’d rather run against than ‘Little Michael.’ That I can tell you.” But he has challenges ahead. He’s as not well known outside of New York City. Also, Bloomberg probably won’t participate in any of the Democratic debates, and he’s likely to skip the early primaries and caucuses. His hope: to surge on Super Tuesday and chart a path to the nomination. “I am running for president to defeat Donald Trump, and to unite and rebuild America.”"

That is a deliberate choice by Mr. Biden: He proposes returning the top income tax bracket to 39.6 percent, after Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax law cut it to 37 percent.

But Mr. Biden would only subject individuals’ income above $510,000 to that top rate. Before the Trump tax cuts, the top rate started at just under $420,000 for individuals.

Mr. Biden would also repeal a limitation that the Trump tax law placed on the deduction of state and local taxes from federal taxes. The law capped the so-called SALT deduction at $10,000 for individuals or households, a change that raised taxes on some higher-earning taxpayers in high-tax and predominantly Democratic states like California, New York and New Jersey.

Corporations would also be subject to a lower rate under Mr. Biden’s plan than they were before the passage of Mr. Trump’s tax cuts. The 2017 cuts reduced the corporate rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent. Mr. Biden would raise it to 28 percent — the same rate Mr. Obama proposed in a tax overhaul plan he was unable to push through as president.

Mr. Biden would unambiguously raise taxes on millionaires, and not just by lifting the top rate. He would raise the tax rate on capital gains — the proceeds from the sale of a stock, vacation home or other investment asset — to 39.6 percent from 23.8 percent, for taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year. He would also limit those taxpayers’ itemized deductions and eliminate an inflation adjustment at death that reduces capital gains liabilities for wealthy heirs."

Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk, according to people familiar with the effort.

The former prosecutors, who have faced allegations of corruption, all played some role in promoting claims about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a former United States ambassador to Ukraine and Ukrainians who disseminated damaging information about Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in 2016.

Those claims — some baseless and others with key disputed elements — have been the foundations of the effort by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government to commit itself to investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump heading into his re-election campaign. That effort in turn has led to the impeachment proceedings in the House against the president."

Democrats Say Yes,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/Elizabeth-Warren-tax-increases.html,"Ms. Warren is making the case that the economy could benefit if money is redistributed from the rich and corporations to uses that she and other liberals say would be more productive. Their argument combines hard data showing that high levels of inequality and wealth concentration weigh down economic growth with a belief that well-targeted government spending can encourage more Americans to work, invest and build skills that would make them more productive.

Fueling their argument is the fact that the United States now has one of the lowest corporate tax burdens among developed nations — a direct result of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Tax revenues at all levels of government in the United States fell to 24.3 percent of the economy last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported on Thursday, down from 26.8 percent in 2017. America is now has the fourth lowest tax burden in all of the O.E.C.D., just above Mexico, Chile and Ireland, a development that Democrats say has helped corporate executives and shareholders get rich but has done little to help working Americans.

In making their pitch, Democrats cite evidence that transferring money to poor and middle-class individuals would increase consumer spending because they spend a larger share of their incomes than wealthy Americans, who tend to save and invest.

“The economy has changed, our understanding of it has changed, and we understand the constricting effects of inequality” on growth, said Heather Boushey, the president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank focused on inequality.

Inequality has widened significantly in America over the last several decades. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the incomes of the top 1 percent of Americans more than tripled from 1979 to 2016, before taxes and government transfer payments are taken into account. For the middle class, incomes grew 33 percent. More than a decade after the recession, wage growth for the middle class continues to run well behind previous times of economic expansion, like the late 1990s.

Research by the economist Emmanuel Saez and colleagues shows that the last time such a small sliver of Americans controlled such a large share of the nation’s income and wealth was in the late 1920s, just before a stock market crash set off the Great Depression. World Bank researchers have warned that high levels of inequality are stifling growth in South Africa, which has the globe’s worst measured inequality."

But a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the nation remains in a period of relatively slow growth in health spending.

Health spending in the United States rose by 4.6 percent to $3.6 trillion in 2018 — accounting for 17.7 percent of the economy — compared to a growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2017. Federal officials said the slight acceleration was largely the result of reinstating a tax on health insurers that the Affordable Care Act imposed but Congress had suspended for a year in 2017. Faster growth in medical prices and prescription drug spending were also factors, they said, but comparatively minor.

For decades, national health spending galloped ahead of spending in the overall economy, lowering wages and stressing household budgets. But over the last decade, the pattern has shifted somewhat. Although the country consistently spends more on health care each year than it did the year before, the overall rate of growth has stayed below historical averages. In 2018, health spending grew more slowly than the economy overall, a rare occurrence .

The factors leading to the slowdown are not fully understood. For years, economists thought they were the result of lagging effects of the recession. But as the pattern has continued far into the economic recovery, they increasingly point to changes in the delivery of health care itself."

Ah, but there’s the rub: All this overspending creates a lot of employment — and moving toward a more efficient and equitable health care system will inevitably mean getting rid of many administrative jobs. One study suggests that about 1.8 million jobs would be rendered unnecessary if America adopted a public health care financing system.

So what if some of these jobs involve debt collection, claims denial, aggressive legal action or are otherwise punitive, cruel or simply morally indefensible in a society that can clearly afford to provide high-quality health care to everyone? Jobs are jobs, folks, as Joe Biden might say.

Indeed, that’s exactly what Biden’s presidential campaign is saying about the Medicare for all plans that Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing: They “will not only cost 160 million Americans their private health coverage and force tax increases on the middle class, but it would also kill almost two million jobs,” a Biden campaign official warned recently.

Note the word “kill” in the statement. That word might better describe not what could happen to jobs under Medicare for all but what the health care industry is doing to many Americans today.

Last week, the medical journal JAMA published a comprehensive study examining the cause of a remarkably grim statistic about our national well-being. From 1959 to 2010, life expectancy in the United States and in other wealthy countries around the world climbed. Then, in 2014, American life expectancy began to fall, while it continued to rise elsewhere.

What caused the American decline? Researchers identified a number of potential factors, including tobacco use, obesity and psychological stress, but two of the leading causes can be pinned directly on the peculiarities and dysfunctions of American health care.

The first is the opioid epidemic, whose rise can be traced to the release, in 1996, of the prescription pain drug OxyContin. In the public narrative, much of the blame for the epidemic has been cast on the Sackler family, whose firm, Purdue Pharma, created OxyContin and pushed for its widespread use. But research has shown that the Sacklers exploited aberrant incentives in American health care."

The president himself has unleashed a stream of unfounded accusations against the Bidens and pushed for them to appear at a potential impeachment trial in the Senate.

There is no evidence that the elder Mr. Biden, while serving as vice president, improperly intervened in Ukraine to benefit his son.

The barrage of attacks is the latest example of Mr. Trump’s monthslong fixation with Mr. Biden, who leads the Democratic field in national polling and has bested the president in head-to-head surveys in several key battleground states.

Hello.

How are you?

Nice to see you, Michael.

Hi, Jessica Cheung.

bernie sanders

Jessica. Nice to see you. Where would you like me?

michael barbaro

Very nice to meet you, Michael Barbaro. So, Senator Sanders, my colleague Alex Burns told me that to understand your political career, and your presidential campaign today, we have to go back to the first time that you won elected office as mayor of Burlington in 1981. So that’s —

bernie sanders

The New York Times got it right. Every once in a while.

michael barbaro

So that’s what I want to ask you about.

bernie sanders

All right, there you go.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

archived recording Burlington is the largest city in Vermont. Situated as it is on Lake Champlain with the Adirondack Mountains view, it’s a lovely, lovely spot. We’d like you to meet its new mayor. Mayor Sanders got a lot of attention recently, not only with his ten vote victory, but mostly because he is a socialist.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ronald Reagan and his billionaire friends do not represent America, but we do. Lastly, I want to touch upon an issue that dear to my heart, and that is the issue of affordable health care. The people of Burlington voted overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly in support of Congress moving forward to establish a national health care system. I think that is exactly how this country is going to have to go on that issue.

michael barbaro

It’s Friday, December 6. Alex Burns, why this moment?

alex burns

Bernie Sanders is such an unusual character in American politics, as a lifelong socialist and left wing activist who has endured for decades as a major political figure, and who has become a leading presidential candidate. And to understand how he got from, really, the fringes of American politics to the absolute forefront, you have to go back to this moment in the early 1980s where he becomes mayor of Burlington, where he figures out how to take those ideas and actually win elections with them, and then govern. This is a period I’ve been spending a lot of time on in my own reporting because it’s just such a vital formative experience for Sanders. And so the story starts with the turn of the 1970s as Bernie Sanders arrives in Vermont with a whole lot of left wing ideas, not a whole lot of local connections, and links up with a new marginal political party called the Liberty Union.

bernie sanders

And that party had been formed around opposition to the war in Vietnam, and in the fight for economic justice. It’s a very small party in a very small state.

michael barbaro

Bernie Sanders starts showing up to Liberty Union meetings, and the party identifies him as the man they want to run for a U.S. Senate seat in 1971.

bernie sanders

And it was a very interesting campaign, and so forth, and so on. I got two percent of the vote.

michael barbaro

He loses that election, but then he has gotten the electoral bug.

bernie sanders

A year later, there was the general election. I ran for governor of the state, I got one percent.

michael barbaro

He loses again.

bernie sanders

Then I ran for Senate again against Pat Leahy, as Leahy often reminds me, and I got four percent.

michael barbaro

And again, he loses. I’m seeing a pattern here.

bernie sanders

Yes.

michael barbaro

It is loss, after loss, after loss. And while he’s running and losing, he has a series of odd jobs.

bernie sanders

I was doing some writing. I was banging nails, doing a little bit of carpentry work.

michael barbaro

He also had a job putting together newsreels and educational film strips about history for school kids.

bernie sanders

That’s before video. For younger people, there was a thing called film strips. I won’t go through what they were, photographs and sound. And I did most of the work myself, had a little bit of help, photography and so forth. It was lot of fun, actually.

michael barbaro

He sells these films to schools in the region, and he also spends time putting together a project that he’s personally quite invested in and proud of.

archived recording If you are the average American who watches television 40 hours a week, you have probably heard of such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman. Strangely enough, however, nobody has told you about Eugene Debs, one of the most important Americans of the 20th century.

michael barbaro

Which is a film about the life of the legendary American socialist leader, Eugene Debs.

bernie sanders

Debs was a very great American. He was one of the original founders of industrial unionism, socialist party candidate for president six times, somebody I admired a whole lot.

archived recording (eugene debs) The ruling class has always taught and trained you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war, and to have yourself slaughtered at their command. But in all the history of the world, you the people have never had a voice in declaring war.

michael barbaro

So throughout the 1970s, he is this activist educator who is running campaign after campaign, and losing every time. He’s not really developing a professional or political career for himself in Vermont. But in the city of Burlington —

bernie sanders

In 1980 or so, some friends of mine came up to me. And they said, you know, there’s going to be a mayor’s election coming up in ‘81. And you know what, we checked the records, and you did pretty well running as a Liberty Union candidate. You got actually 12 percent of the vote in some of the working class districts in Burlington.

michael barbaro

So two percent, or four percent, or six percent —

bernie sanders

That was statewide. But in Burlington, we did better.

michael barbaro

You were doing better.

bernie sanders

Yeah. So we got a bunch of people together, and they said, O.K., we’ll do it.

archived recording Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn born self-described socialist running for mayor for the first time in 1981, running against a Democratic old guard that had run the city for a decade.

michael barbaro

When Sanders becomes a candidate for mayor, he is facing off against a powerful Democratic establishment. Burlington at this point, for decades has been essentially a one party town with a relatively conservative Democratic ruling clique that has just had a hammerlock on city politics. The incumbent mayor is not seen by anybody as vulnerable, to the point that the Republicans don’t even field a candidate against him. He’s also up against, just a culture of apathy when it comes to municipal elections. People generally don’t show up to vote for mayor, or for other city offices. So Bernie Sanders and this kind of ragtag group of academics and activists and intellectuals band together to try to figure out how to crack a city election in a place where nobody like them has ever won before.

bernie sanders

You would literally not believe if I told you how little we knew about politics. At the end of the day, I mean, real politics. It’s one thing to run for statewide office knowing you’re not going to win and get on our radio show and talk about issues, which I could do, but the nitty-gritty of politics.

michael barbaro

So as a newcomer to city politics, Bernie Sanders runs a different kind of campaign from the campaigns he’s run before. This isn’t about 30,000 foot ideological issues, like when he was a protest candidate for the Senate.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ruth, you’re a volunteer worker at the old North end food co-op here in Burlington. archived recording Right. We’re on disability, social security. archived recording (bernie sanders) You got cut from $131 to — archived recording $48. archived recording (bernie sanders) And what was the justification for that? How do they expect you to live on the difference? archived recording They don’t care.

michael barbaro

This is a ground level campaign that’s waged over really concrete kitchen table issues that are relevant, he hopes, to a wide array of constituencies in the city that feel like they’ve been left out by the existing power structure.

bernie sanders

We had a lot of support in, for example, low income housing projects from people were getting a raw deal from the city that ran the projects. We had support from environmental groups. We had support from one group in the south end of the city. There was going to be a major highway going right through the neighborhood, and they said, we don’t like that.

michael barbaro

So Sanders is gaining some real support in this race. He’s not a trivial candidate, but still, the powers that be in Burlington do not see him as a threat to win this election. Let me talk about election night. What was the story of that night for you?

bernie sanders

Well, when I walked in on election day, I was of two opinions. Number one, that we would lose very heavily. And the newspapers, some guy, a newspaper writer was covering it, he said, the odds of Sanders winning are about 100 to one. That was literally what they wrote. So either we were doing something magical, or we would lose overwhelmingly. What I did not anticipate is that on election night, I think the results were, we were ahead by 14 votes. And after the recount, 10 votes. That, I did not expect.

archived recording Many people in Burlington are still in a state of shock following that city’s most stunning political upset in memory last night.

michael barbaro

The press reports from election night describe him as stunned, and then elated that he wins. And he wins by the absolute narrowest of margins, just ten votes.

alex burns

Ten votes.

archived recording Bernard Sanders, one of the founders of the Liberty Union Party, and a consistent loser in previous quests for elective office, was now the big winner. Considered by many to be unelectable because of his so-called radical views, Mr. Sanders put together an unlikely coalition of supporters and edged the ten year incumbent Gordon Paquette.

michael barbaro

So your strategy had worked. When you take office, how did becoming an elected official, the day to day reality of it, match your expectations of the power of winning this office and being mayor?

bernie sanders

Well, we had a very unique experience.

alex burns

Bernie Sanders has pulled off an extraordinary feat. He has upended the city establishment, he has become a socialist mayor in the United States at the height of the Cold War. But what happens next is he runs into a brick wall of political opposition. There is a body in Burlington, the Board of Aldermen. We would call it a city council. There are 13 members, 11 of them are either Democrats or Republicans, but their party label matters less than the fact that they are opposed to Bernie Sanders. He comes in, the powerful Democrats and the powerful Republicans both essentially say, he should not be the mayor of the city, and he will not be the mayor of the city for very long. Because we’re going to make sure that he can’t get anything done.

michael barbaro

People were trying to sabotage you?

bernie sanders

Trying to sabotage me, yes. They were trying to sabotage me. The first thing they did was to fire my secretary.

michael barbaro

They have the power to fire your secretary?

bernie sanders

Yeah, they did.

michael barbaro

So they reject his secretary. They take it back pretty quickly, but the damage to the relationship is kind of done. Not only do the board of Aldermen mess with his ability to hire a secretary, they reject all of his nominees for the top jobs in the city, city clerk, city treasurer, city attorney.

bernie sanders

And they made me run the city for the first year with exactly the administration of the guy I had beaten. You know, it’s like —

michael barbaro

You’re being neutered.

bernie sanders

Yes. So it’s like, you know, Donald Trump running his administration with Barack Obama’s appointees.

alex burns

So for really his first full year as mayor, he has a somewhat ornamental role.

michael barbaro

How are how are you thinking about this challenge?

bernie sanders

Well, their attitude, what they had said, and one of their leaders said, well, look. Bernie Sanders is a fluke. That was the word they used, and they said —

michael barbaro

Your brand of politics, everything about you, they thought was just a fluke.

bernie sanders

Right, this is an accident that should never have happened. And we will stonewall him in the first year, people will see that he can’t accomplish anything, then we’ll go back to the old ways.

michael barbaro

They’re going to drive you from office.

bernie sanders

Yeah. Well, it was a brutal year. So what we had to do was literally form a parallel city government without any money. I mean, we didn’t, couldn’t pay anybody, but we brought together a group of strong supporters and we had them helping us working on legislation and ideas. And we did everything that we could while we were being absolutely opposed by the Democratic and Republicans on the board of Aldermen. So we organized at the grass-roots level, we mobilize people. Our job was to get people involved in the political process.

michael barbaro

How did you do that?

bernie sanders

Well, I’ll tell you how we did it. Even before I took office, we had meetings on issues that people were concerned about that had been ignored for a very long time. We said, we believe in arts. You know, a city has got to be vital and alive. What do we do about the arts? What do we do about economic development? What do we do about women’s rights? So we ended up storming a council on Arts, a council on women, a council on youth. We started what we called neighborhood planning associations, which meant we gave local neighborhoods, each ward had a certain amount of money and they spent it however they wanted. So we tried to democratize it, and we brought people into the process. So it wasn’t me saying, we’re going to do A, B and C. These were people who themselves were now empowered.

michael barbaro

So you’re finding a way to essentially circumvent these aldermen who think you’re a fluke, and think they can block you by literally tapping into —

bernie sanders

Right.

michael barbaro

More voters, more people. When did you know that this strategy was actually working?

bernie sanders

Well, when hundreds of people would show up at city council meetings and demand our agenda. We were fighting for an agenda, it was being blocked by the city council. So people were upset about it, and here’s the interesting thing: We have elections for mayor then every two years, but half the board of Aldermen comes up on the odd year.

michael barbaro

So in 1982, one year after Sanders becomes mayor, seven of the 13 members of the board of aldermen are up for re-election.

bernie sanders

Essentially, there was a referendum on my administration.

michael barbaro

These elections became a chance for Mayor Sanders to go directly to the voters and ask them to replace these intransigent members of the board of aldermen with people who are friendly to him and supportive of his ideas.

bernie sanders

We ran candidates in almost every ward in the city. I probably have never worked so hard in my life. I knocked on almost every door in the city with the candidates that we were running with. And this is the winter time in Vermont, so we’re talking about 10 below zero, in zero weather. And on election night, the turnout was phenomenal for a non-mayor’s race, it was just off the charts. In five — if my memory is correct, in the five wards that we ran in, we won outright three of the wards, in all of the working class areas. And here is the most exciting thing about all of this. If you go back to the basement of City Hall and check the old records in Burlington, what you’ll find is that between 1979, that was the previous election before I won, and two years later when I was running for re-election we doubled voter turnout.

michael barbaro

He’s right, voter turnout really did rise in Burlington when Sanders got involved in city politics. And some of that is about him and his message and his political organization. Some of it is just having contested elections, elections where people file to run against the people who are already sitting in public office. When you have two choices rather than one, then yeah, more people show up to make a choice.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Good evening. We’re recording this on Friday, March 5th, and we’ve decided to get out of City Hall, get out of the office. And we’re here on the first floor the Burlington Square Mall.

michael barbaro

And he continues to engage and attempt to inspire voters in this same way, getting out in the community. He’s a highly visible mayor.

archived recording (bernie sanders) And I think what we’ll do is have some informal discussions with Vermonters as they walk past us, and as we can grab them. And we’ll see if we can get their views on some of the important issues of the day. But before we do —

michael barbaro

He creates a local television show called “Bernie Speaks With the Community,” where he is just out there and connected to your average voter.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Oops, oh, here we go. archived recording Hi, Shannon. archived recording (bernie sanders) Shannon, do you live in Burlington, Shannon? archived recording Yeah. archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. So how are things going with you? archived recording Pretty good. I was just wondering, my mother had this idea for an indoor/outdoor amusement park by the waterfront, and she wanted — and I want to know if, is there anything going to be done about it? archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, I can’t say for sure that something will be done immediately. I think it is a good idea, and interestingly enough, your mother mentioned —

michael barbaro

It’s a highly unusual approach for a municipal politician, and especially in a city where the mayor had not been that kind of man about town previous.

archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. The next person that we’ve kidnapped here off the streets for a few words is Jodie Baggerly. Jodie, welcome. archived recording (jodie baggerly) Well, thank you. One thing I want to appreciate, being a disabled person, is the little discount we get on our cable TVs, because I think it’s a positive point to have educational programs to be able to watch and fill our minds at periods when we are unable to get out. archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me just jump in and remind our viewers. What Jodie is talking about is, the city negotiated with the Mountain Cable Company —

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, in brief, what are the lessons of this moment for you?

bernie sanders

Lessons of this moment is that winning politics is grass-roots politics, that winning politics is developing coalitions of working people, of low income people, of women, of environmentalists. So coalition is, we do it from the bottom on up, and we ended up in my years as mayor taking on everybody.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Alex, in Sanders’s telling, in the face of total political opposition and stonewalling, his solution is to essentially do what got him political power in the first place, which is go to the people, talk to the people, always the people.

alex burns

That’s his political brand as mayor, much as it’s his political brand now. And in Burlington, it’s an approach that really works for him. It establishes him as a legitimate city executive with an independent power base who cannot just be treated as an interloper in City Hall. It’s also the first of a couple stages in Mayor Sanders’ campaign to reinvent Burlington city politics. And if the first part of that is about really engaging with city politics at the ground level, the next stage after he’s been mayor for a couple of years, is to look way beyond Burlington and take on big national and international political issues, and connect them back to the local level.

archived recording If I were the president of the largest bank in Burlington, I’d be real nervous about you. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, they may be, they may be. But I think — and they are. But I think what we’ve often talked about also, is that my powers as mayor are in many ways limited. And I have my visions as to what life should be in Vermont, in Burlington, and in the United States, but we are going to speak out, though, on national and international issues which affect the city of Burlington. For example, obviously, we’re very concerned about Mr. Reagan’s policies which are impacting devastatingly on low income and working people. But we know what our powers are within the city of Burlington.

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, during this period you start talking about national issues. You start talking about President Reagan, his economic policy. You start talking about foreign policy. You send letters to the leaders of Japan expressing regret for the two bombs that were dropped on that country by the U.S. What was your thinking? As you’re building this coalition locally, you start talking about issues beyond the borders of Burlington. And what is your thinking —

bernie sanders

Well, let’s be clear. 90 plus percent of our energy was dealing with local issues like reforming the police department and paving the streets. We brought a minor league baseball team into Burlington, Vermont. 95, 98 percent of our work was locally, doing what mayors are supposed to do. But as part of empowering people, what we also believed is it was important to think globally and act locally. So if we were spending a whole lot of money in Washington under Reagan, investing in military spending, or giving tax breaks to the rich, that impacted the city of Burlington. We are mayors, we need money to help us with housing. We need money to help us with roads and infrastructure, and yet Washington is spending this money on the military, or they’re busy invading another country, or whatever they’re doing. We should be speaking up on those issues.

archived recording (bernie sanders) The question is whether we use the incredible wealth and natural resources and intelligence of our society to create a decent standard of living, a decent life for all of our people in this country and abroad, or do we develop the greatest military machine for killing in the history of the world. That’s what the choice is.

bernie sanders

This was in the middle of the Cold War, and we started a sister-city program. I know the, some of the right wing media misinterprets this. But what we did is, I took a group of about a dozen people from Burlington to Yaroslavl in the old Soviet Union.

archived recording [SINGING]

bernie sanders

We had hockey teams coming out, we had doctors coming in and out, we had kids coming in and out. It really — I love the idea of sister-city programs, and it worked phenomenally well.

archived recording [SINGING] This land is your land, this land is my land —

bernie sanders

And it involved a lot of people. So the kids began to learn about Russia, and I happened to believe then, and I believe now, that if we’re going to bring peace to the world, we need a lot of cultural exchanges, we need a lot of youth exchanges. In fact, I recently proposed taking one-tenth of one percent of the military budget and putting it into cultural exchanges, which I think is a very good investment.

archived recording [SINGING] Your land, this land is my land. From California to the New York islands. From the red wood forests — archived recording (bernie sanders) I had an experience this last summer, I was invited by the government of Nicaragua to attend the sixth anniversary of their revolution. And they must have had four or 500,000 people out there listening to speeches, and the horrible thought that I had really sunk my stomach, was that kids in my own city, young kids, working class kids, might be asked by this president to go to Nicaragua to kill and get killed. And it was a horrible thought.

michael barbaro

Some of these endeavors were relatively bold. At a certain point, you go to Nicaragua. You end up meeting with the leader of the Sandinistas. And I — oh, no. I’m not worried about any —

bernie sanders

No, I’m just —

michael barbaro

Oh, you’re worried about time?

bernie sanders

Yeah, we’re running. Yes, we are running — how are we doing on time?

michael barbaro

Five more minutes?

bernie sanders

I think we’re probably going to have to end it right now.

michael barbaro

Oh. No, no, no. This is not a — don’t end it on this question if that’s the issue.

bernie sanders

Well, you know, the issue is —

michael barbaro

Trust me, this is not — all I was going to asking you was, how do events like that connect to voters in Burlington? In your mind —

bernie sanders

Good, absolutely. Very good question. Well, I’ll tell you why —

michael barbaro

How does meeting with an international leader like that —

bernie sanders

I’ll tell you why it does. Because I believe we have to empower people. One of the things we did is, we said to people, speak out on national and international issues. Yes, the mayor of the city of Burlington can’t determine the defense budget. But if we rally people all over the country speaking out on these issues, then the members of Congress and U.S. senators will hear that. So to answer your question, this is just another mechanism that we had to say to people, you have a voice. Do you think we should be spending more money on nuclear weapons? Vote on it. Talk about it. So all of this has to do with empowering people to understand that in a democracy, they can determine the future.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you make of that?

alex burns

That is really the essence of the Bernie Sanders approach to politics, that the most important thing a political leader can do is give voice to people’s deepest concerns and frustrations, and encourage people to give voice to it themselves. And if there is a gap between what that political leader is expressing or channeling, and what he can actually accomplish, it’s almost irrelevant, that the act of expression and engagement is the most important thing. And what happens when you draw people in on an issue like climate change, or the Reagan administration’s policies in Central America, is they become politically activated in a way that then transforms politics closer to home at the local level.

michael barbaro

And Sanders did eventually articulate what you’re describing, but not before he got frustrated with me and seemed to indicate he might end the interview when I mentioned Nicaragua. What do you think that that’s about?

alex burns

Well first of all this is a really charged moment in his early career and in American politics. There has been a revolution in Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas are a left wing revolutionary movement that overthrows a repressive regime. They are seen as dangerous by the Reagan administration because they are so left wing, and the Republicans in Washington prop up a brutal right wing militia to fight the Sandinistas. Bernie Sanders is one of many Americans on the left who get involved at that point in demonstrating in favor of the Sandinistas, or against Ronald Reagan. Except Sanders takes it considerably further when he actually goes to Nicaragua, shakes hands with Ortega himself. This is a story that someone in Sanders’s position probably ought to be able to explain. Or at least you would think he would feel comfortable explaining it. And what I find somewhat confounding as a reporter is how much he resents even the prompt to go into his thinking at the time and to reflect a little bit on some of the things about his support for the Sandinistas that may not look as justifiable in retrospect. He doesn’t want to do that. My sense is that, at the heart of it for him, is this sense that even asking the question is a kind of red baiting, that it reflects the way the political establishment — and he very much lumps the media in with the political establishment, is out to get him. Much as it was in Burlington, much as he believes it was in the 2016 campaign. This is a guy who in his early days as mayor was described by a fellow elected official as representing the fungus of socialism. He is somebody who is very, very sensitive to anything he perceives as the charge that he is not just a populist, not just very liberal, but this wildly outside the mainstream dangerous radical. And when you raise Nicaragua, I do think that’s the nerve that it hits.

michael barbaro

So that there’s no misunderstanding, those who listen and ask about Nicaragua, I want to give you a chance to make sure that there’s no confusion for any listener who’s casually checking in.

bernie sanders

All right —

michael barbaro

The question is, was there anything about Daniel Ortega that —

bernie sanders

Let me just say this.

michael barbaro

You knew at the time that gave you pause.

bernie sanders

Well, what gave me pause was that the United States at that time, as you may recall. I don’t know, do you remember —

michael barbaro

I was a student.

bernie sanders

Who the president was before Ortega? A dictator named Somoza who was a dictator, a very bad guy supported by the United States of America. Then Ortega came to power, the Sandinistas came to power, and the United States intended to do what it had done in many instances. You are aware the United States has a habit of overthrowing governments in Latin America.

michael barbaro

Yes.

bernie sanders

I didn’t think that was a good idea. Didn’t think it was a good idea then, and I didn’t think it was a good idea now. So we worked against American intervention. So we went there to say, as part of a national movement, that the United States should not be involved.

michael barbaro

Right.

About overthrowing small governments.

michael barbaro

And for the record, in ‘85, were you aware of any human rights issues or abuses by Ortega?

bernie sanders

Well, we were aware that this was a very controversial moment, having taken over from a dictatorship. We were also aware that the United States at that time was supporting many governments in Latin America who were much more brutal than Ortega was.

alex burns

What you hear there is such an evasiveness about assessing the Ortega government on its own merits, that he really wants to talk about his advocacy around Nicaragua exclusively as a repudiation of Reagan, and not as an endorsement of what was going on there. And if you look at his comments and activities at the time, that’s not quite right. He was more explicitly supportive of what the Sandinistas were doing then just going there as a sort of anti-interventionist advocate. But in fairness to Sanders, this was not a fringe position at the time. Support for the Sandinistas has obviously not necessarily aged as well as Bernie Sanders might have expected it to politically, and that’s I think where you hear his real discomfort talking about it in the context of this campaign.

michael barbaro

But in taking this trip and talking about it the way he does, he is living his creed, essentially.

alex burns

Exactly. It is using all the levers of his power and public influence as an elected official to weigh in on this subject that is about as distant, literally, from Burlington as you can get.

As this strategy is being deployed, you’re winning your fourth term as mayor. And you go on, successfully this time, to run for statewide office. The House, the Senate, and then, of course, you run for president 2016, now again in 2020. In each of these campaigns and each of these moments, you’re building larger and more powerful coalitions of voters. And given that history and your success in doing that, what do you think is the big lesson from this early phase? Why do you think it is that when we went to Alex Burns and asked him this question, and he said, you have to go back to ‘81, you have to go back to Burlington to understand Senator Sanders and this campaign and this moment. Why is he right, why do we have to go back to that race and that moment?

bernie sanders

Politics in America has been very much from the top on down. You still read articles in The New York Times where wealthy donors gathered today at a hotel to express concern about the Democratic candidates. Who cares about wealthy donors? We have over 1.1 million Americans who have made donations to our campaign. And they’re not wealthy, these are working class people. They’re teachers, they’re workers at Amazon, they’re workers at Walmart. What I believe then and what I believe now, the way you transform society is from the bottom on up. You talk about issues that are relevant to working people, issues that are relevant to low income people, issues that are relevant to young people, and you grow the voter base. So what I pointed out to you, maybe the most important thing that we did, is from 1979 to 1983, we doubled, doubled the number of people voting. And what we’re trying to do in this campaign right now —

michael barbaro

Is parallel.

bernie sanders

Is to significantly increase the voter turnout by talking to people who don’t vote. In Burlington, what happened is low income and working class people saw that government could work for them. And they said, oh my God, I never knew that. My kids now have a program, we have an after school program they didn’t have. We have a child care center we didn’t have. Our streets are getting paved, snow is getting moved. I didn’t know that — we’re going to go out, we’re going to support Bernie, and we’re going to support the candidates that he wants for Board of Aldermen. And now what we have to do in this country, which has one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country on earth, is to reach out to those working people, reach out to those young people. And when they start participating in the political process, that is the political revolution.

michael barbaro

If you become president, the question will be, sure, you talked about national and international issues when you were mayor, but there was no real expectation that you could change the course of events as a single mayor of a town in Burlington. If you become president, that expectation will be real and urgent and present. So are we to understand that if you run into political obstacles as president, that your strategy will be to call upon the expanded electorate that you have created and turned that into a political force that you would then, all of what you did in Burlington with the Board of Aldermen?

bernie sanders

Yes. Well, it’s not an if. That is exactly what is going to happen. When we talk about the need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to every person through a Medicare for all, single-payer program, the only way that’s going to happen is when millions of people stand up and take on the insurance companies and the drug companies. When we talk about transforming our energy system to save the planet from the devastation, absolute devastation of the global crisis regarding climate change, the only way that happens is when millions of people stand up to take on the fossil fuel industry. So on all of the issues we are talking about, that’s what the political revolution is about. It’s saying that we’re going to mobilize millions of people to stand up for an agenda that works for working families. And when they do that, there will be no stopping them. We will be able to create a government and an economy that works for all, not just the one percent.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you think of that theory?

alex burns

Well, the coalition that he’s trying to build as a presidential candidate is such an echo of what he accomplished in Burlington. And his theory is, they are going to show up for him in a way they wouldn’t show up for any other candidate because he is speaking to their concerns directly. And Sanders has plenty of reason to expect that might really be the case. He has charted this remarkable ascent as a national political figure on the strength of this coalition and mainstreamed a set of socialist and quasi-socialist ideas that were seen as really outside the mainstream when he started campaigning on them decades ago, into the center of one of the country’s two major political parties. The question for someone like Bernie Sanders is, does that theory work in a general election on a national scale? Can you really bring in that many new people into the political process where there already are a whole lot of people who vote, and who have pretty vested interests in the context of an American election? Can you speak in the way he does to the concerns of working class people without alienating millions of people who already vote for the Democratic Party, and don’t necessarily share that world view? And could you, as the president, use that exact same playbook, that exact same coalition to master Washington and break a Republican Senate in the same way that he transformed Burlington and broke a city council?

Ms. Nnaemeka seemed confident of the party’s future.

“There are new formations that are aligning. The D.S.A. is growing, and there are all sorts of other insurgent left groups that we are in a deep relationship with,” she said in an interview, referring to the Democratic Socialists of America.

“We were still on an upward trajectory,” she added. “We still delivered on progressive visions even as our party changed shape.”

Bill Lipton, whom Ms. Nnaemeka is replacing, said he would be involved with the state party through the 2020 election, then work on climate issues for the national party.

The W.F.P. and the D.S.A. may not agree on everything. The W.F.P., for example, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary; the Democratic Socialists have endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders.

Democrats Say Yes,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/Elizabeth-Warren-tax-increases.html,"Ms. Warren is making the case that the economy could benefit if money is redistributed from the rich and corporations to uses that she and other liberals say would be more productive. Their argument combines hard data showing that high levels of inequality and wealth concentration weigh down economic growth with a belief that well-targeted government spending can encourage more Americans to work, invest and build skills that would make them more productive.

Fueling their argument is the fact that the United States now has one of the lowest corporate tax burdens among developed nations — a direct result of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Tax revenues at all levels of government in the United States fell to 24.3 percent of the economy last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported on Thursday, down from 26.8 percent in 2017. America is now has the fourth lowest tax burden in all of the O.E.C.D., just above Mexico, Chile and Ireland, a development that Democrats say has helped corporate executives and shareholders get rich but has done little to help working Americans.

In making their pitch, Democrats cite evidence that transferring money to poor and middle-class individuals would increase consumer spending because they spend a larger share of their incomes than wealthy Americans, who tend to save and invest.

“The economy has changed, our understanding of it has changed, and we understand the constricting effects of inequality” on growth, said Heather Boushey, the president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank focused on inequality.

Inequality has widened significantly in America over the last several decades. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the incomes of the top 1 percent of Americans more than tripled from 1979 to 2016, before taxes and government transfer payments are taken into account. For the middle class, incomes grew 33 percent. More than a decade after the recession, wage growth for the middle class continues to run well behind previous times of economic expansion, like the late 1990s.

Research by the economist Emmanuel Saez and colleagues shows that the last time such a small sliver of Americans controlled such a large share of the nation’s income and wealth was in the late 1920s, just before a stock market crash set off the Great Depression. World Bank researchers have warned that high levels of inequality are stifling growth in South Africa, which has the globe’s worst measured inequality."

But a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the nation remains in a period of relatively slow growth in health spending.

Health spending in the United States rose by 4.6 percent to $3.6 trillion in 2018 — accounting for 17.7 percent of the economy — compared to a growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2017. Federal officials said the slight acceleration was largely the result of reinstating a tax on health insurers that the Affordable Care Act imposed but Congress had suspended for a year in 2017. Faster growth in medical prices and prescription drug spending were also factors, they said, but comparatively minor.

For decades, national health spending galloped ahead of spending in the overall economy, lowering wages and stressing household budgets. But over the last decade, the pattern has shifted somewhat. Although the country consistently spends more on health care each year than it did the year before, the overall rate of growth has stayed below historical averages. In 2018, health spending grew more slowly than the economy overall, a rare occurrence .

The factors leading to the slowdown are not fully understood. For years, economists thought they were the result of lagging effects of the recession. But as the pattern has continued far into the economic recovery, they increasingly point to changes in the delivery of health care itself."

It is hard to look at this field of candidates and not remember a cascading list of missteps. And many of them have things in their past for which they have apologized. But one question is why missteps are fatal to some campaigns and not others.
