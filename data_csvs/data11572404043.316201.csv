Fox News Exclusive: Joe, Hunter Biden seen golfing with Ukraine gas company exec back in 2014, photo shows

A photo obtained by Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" shows former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings with Hunter. Earlier this month, Joe Biden told Fox News in Iowa that he never discussed his son’s foreign business dealings with him. “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden said, pointing the finger at President Trump. “I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader. You should be looking at Trump.”

Hunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken “just once” about his work in Ukraine. A source told Fox News the photo was taken in August 2014. News reports at the time indicated the vice president was in the Hamptons. Hunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma Holdings board in April 2014. Click here for more on our top story.

Giuliani blasts Biden camp for trying to 'silence' him; Pompeo listened in on Trump-Ukraine call: report

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president, a senior State Department official told the Wall Street Journal. The report would appear to support Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani's claims on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that Pompeo was aware of his efforts to encourage Ukraine’s government to investigate the Bidens. Over the weekend, the Democratic chairmen of three House committees subpoenaed Pompeo for documents related to Ukraine they said were critical to their probe.

House Democrats on Monday subpoenaed Giuliani's text messages, phone records, and other documents and communications as part of their formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump. In an interview on ""Hannity,"" Giuliani blasted the Biden camp for apparently trying to ""silence"" him by encouraging media outlets not to book him as a guest. The former New York City mayor said the Democrats are going to turn into the ""party of corruption."" Meanwhile, top Republicans are wondering whether Trump is a victim of a ""political setup"" by Democrats in the Ukraine call controversy, thanks to comments made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during her ""60 Minutes"" interview on Sunday.

Barr asked Trump to speak to other countries in probe of Russia investigation, official says; source pushes back on New York Times reporting

Separately, a Justice Department official told Fox News on Monday that Attorney General William Barr asked President Trump to make introductions to foreign countries that might have had information pertinent to U.S. Attorney John Durham's ongoing probe into the origins of the Russia collusion investigation and possible misconduct by the intelligence community. But, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News it would be wrong to say Trump ""pressed"" the Australian prime minister for information that could have discredited former Special Counsel Mueller's now-completed probe, as the New York Times reported earlier Monday.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., slammed the Times report on ""Hannity,"" calling it an ""effort"" to shut down Barr's investigation.

Fox News Exclusive: WinRed, new GOP donor platform, reaps impeachment windfall, rakes in millions

WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete with Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations, has raised over $28 million since launching three months ago, with top officials crediting the Democrats’ impeachment push for a big spike in fundraising over the last week, Fox News has learned. WinRed raised $28.1 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday. The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump’s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country.

Mega mall owners mull investing in Forever 21 after bankruptcy

Two mall titans may invest in the bankrupt teen retailer Forever 21. The retailer filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday morning and recently tried to cut a deal in which its two largest landlords, Brookfield Property and Simon Property, would take an ownership stake, according to the New York Post. The reason is Forever 21 uses a lot of mall space with its 541 stores. The nationwide closure of 178 locations would leave big holes at shopping malls. Negotiations between the retailer, Brookfield, and Simon reached an impasse over the weekend and are considered dead -- for now.

* Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was hospitalized yesterday in Las Vegas and “underwent a significant medical procedure after a blockage was found in one of his arteries.” As NBC News’ report added, “Sanders, who is 78, has canceled all of his campaign events ‘until further notice.’”

* Buoyed by African-American support, Joe Biden leads the Democratic presidential field in South Carolina according to the latest Winthrop University poll. The former vice president has 37% support, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 17%. Bernie Sanders is third with 8%, followed by Kamala Harris at 7%.

* Speaking of the Palmetto State, some South Carolina Republicans, including former Rep. Bob Inglis, sued the state Republican Party this week “over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year.”

* As difficult as this may seem to believe, Andrew Yang, a Democratic presidential candidate running for elected office for the first time, raised $10 million in the third quarter. That’s “more than triple the $2.8 million Yang raised in the second quarter.”

* Kamala Harris, meanwhile, raised $11.6 million between July and September, which is awfully close to the $11.8 million she raised in the second quarter.

* Former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), whose 2020 presidential campaign has struggled to gain traction, has reportedly lost four key aides, including his state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire.

* Joe Biden’s campaign released a new plan on gun policy today, which includes an assault-weapons ban. Under the blueprint, those Americans who already own assault weapons would be required to either register the weapons or sell them to the government.

* Speaking of new 2020 plans, Elizabeth Warren’s campaign unveiled a new proposal this morning that would tax lobbying: “Under her proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35% tax on their expenditures. The rate would increase to 60% for spending of more than $1 million, and to 75% above $5 million.”

* And finally, Donald Trump last week told a rather detailed story about CNN building a multi-million-dollar studio in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district, which he said the network intended to keep up “for weeks” if the Democratic candidate won in a recent special election. Like so many of the president’s bizarre anecdotes, the story was completely made up and had no basis in reality."

""Facebook's anti-competitive mergers mean they face no real pressure to tackle disinformation,"" Warren tweeted on Tuesday night. ""They won't even do the bare minimum to improve transparency. Tech giants shouldn't be able to wield enough power to undermine our democracy.""

The tweet followed several others from Warren earlier on Tuesday. The Massachusetts senator reiterated her plan that Facebook, along with other Big Tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple, should be broken up.

FACEBOOK CEO ZUCKERBERG MEETS WITH TRUMP, KEY SENATORS ON DC SWING

On Tuesday, leaked audio comments from Zuckerberg said the company would likely sue the U.S. government if Warren became president and attempted to break up the company.

""You have someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,"" Zuckerberg was quoted as saying in two Q&A sessions with Facebook employees during July.

""And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that’s not the position that you want to be in when you’re, you know, I mean … It’s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.""

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had an accompanying Facebook page taken down after it was deemed in violation of Facebook's policy against impersonation -- a decision the company eventually reversed Tuesday.

William Jacobson, a law professor at Cornell Law School, owns and runs elizabethwarrenwiki.org — a website dedicated to various controversies surrounding the Democratic presidential candidate, particularly her claims of having Native American heritage.

ZUCKERBERG SAYS IF WARREN BECOMES PRESIDENT, FACEBOOK WOULD SUE US GOVERNMENT

He also ran an accompanying Facebook page, which posted articles from the site.

“It was a way of getting the content out to the public,” he told Fox News in an interview.

But on Monday afternoon, Jacobson received a notice saying the page had been taken down for violating Facebook's policies regarding impersonation. Facebook’s community standards forbid users from using other peoples’ images to deceive or mislead people about the origin of the content.

""Pages, groups and events must not impersonate or falsely represent a brand, entity or public figure,"" the policies state. ""Where a Page, group or event is being used to express support for or interest in a brand, entity or public figure, it must make clear in the name or description that it is not an official representation.""

But Jacobson maintains the page was in line with Facebook standards as it carried a disclaimer saying it was not affiliated with Warren’s campaign or Senate office. He posted a screengrab of the disclaimer in an article for Legal Insurrection. He also said the site never attempted to impersonate Warren, even with the disclaimer.

“The page is called 'Elizabeth Warren Wiki' and it has a link to the wiki website and all of the content posted was from the wiki website, so no one could look at the page and think this is her campaign or Senate office because everything was from the wiki website,” he said.

“I think we covered all our bases, and I don’t know how this happened,” he said.

Jacobson said he immediately filed an appeal via the Facebook process. By Tuesday evening, the page was restored.

""This page was mistakenly removed and has been restored,"" Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, told Fox News in an email.

In his original article flagging his concerns, Jacobson wrote: ""It’s another reminder, as when our YouTube page was taken down without warning, that we can’t rely on big tech.""

Before the page was restored, Jacobson wondered if a recent feud between Warren’s supporters and those of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was partly responsible.

“All I know is the last couple of days there was a Twitter war between Bernie and Warren supporters, and Bernie’s supporters were linking to the wiki website,” he said. “It might be pure coincidence or it might be that someone decided to complain to Facebook about the page.”

The suspension came just as comments emerged from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg warning that the company may have to sue the government if Warren becomes president.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden.

The new survey, conducted by the Saint Anselm College Survey Center and released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary – in a distant third place.

Warren, the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another, stands at 25 percent in the survey. Biden, the front-runner in most polls of voters nationwide and in early primary and caucus states since before announced his candidacy in late April, is at 24 percent. The margin between Warren and Biden is well within the poll's margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN, SANDERS SLIPS, IN NEW NH PRIMARY POLL

“There remain several months before New Hampshire Democrats cast their primary ballots, but Warren and Biden have clearly separated themselves from the rest of the field,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics executive director Neil Levesque emphasized.

“If the dynamic of Warren as the candidate that best expresses Democratic voters’ policy preferences and Biden as the one who has the best chance of beating Trump sets in with voters, this is likely turning into a two-person race absent a big shake-up,” he added.

Sanders, the populist independent senator, stands at 11 percent in the survey, with South Bend, Ind. Mayor Buttigieg a point back at 10 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris of California registers at 5 percent in the survey to round out the top five.

The poll’s release comes hours after Sanders reported raising a whopping $25.3 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, with Buttigieg hauling in $19.1 million and Harris bringing in $11.6 million.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25 MILLION JULY-SEPT. CAMPAIGN CASH HAUL

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are each at 3 percent in the survey. Businessman and billionaire environmental and progressive activist Tom Steyer and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are each at 2 percent, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 1 percent. Everyone else sampled came in at less than 1 percent, with 9 percent undecided with just over four months to go until primary day.

Levesque highlighted that “there is still some fluidity in this race, as 65 percent of Warren supporters, 72 percent of Biden supporters, 56 percent of Sanders supporters, and 73 percent of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Among voters who were not firm in their choice of candidate, was the second choice of 26 percent, followed by Biden (12 percent), Buttigieg (11 percent), Sanders and Harris (7 percent each)

Warren also topped the field of candidates on the question of who would make the best president (27 percent, compared to 19 percent who picked Biden). But Biden came out on top when voters were asked who would be the strongest nominee to take on Republican President Donald Trump in next year’s general election (37 percent, compared to 26 percent who picked Warren).

The St. Anselm poll came out a week after a Monmouth University survey in New Hampshire grabbed national attention for indicating that Warren and Biden fighting for the top spot, with Sanders a distant third.

Previous Granite State polls released earlier in September and in late August were all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third showing Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

""Should Donald Trump be banned from Twitter?"" a reporter asked. Warren laughed and said simply, ""No.""

The comment came after Harris sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Tuesday, accusing the president of violating the company's terms of service. ""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing,"" she said.

She specifically pointed to tweets in which the president attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and suggested there would be ""big consequences"" for the whistleblower who reported on his call with Ukraine.

Harris also flagged a tweet in which Trump accused Democrats of engaging in a ""coup."" ""Hey @jack. Time to do something about this,"" Harris tweeted, using the Twitter CEO's handle.

That prompted a clash among media figures as Five Thirty-Eight founder Nate Silver pushed back on removing Trump from his favored platform.

“Twitter is endangering the world and breaking its own terms of service to do it. Trump or Jack must go,” Resistance San Francisco said at the beginning of 2018.

In a blog post around that time, Twitter put the kibosh on banning world leaders from the platform. ""Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation. Elected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society,"" the post read.

""Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate. It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions."""

FACEBOOK CEO ZUCKERBERG MEETS WITH TRUMP, KEY SENATORS ON DC SWING

Zuckerberg, who met with President Trump and several D.C. lawmakers last month, also said that the company's size has helped it fight election interference while noting that its rival, Twitter, has been inadequate at fighting interference because of fewer resources.

“It’s why Twitter can’t do as good of a job as we can,” Zuckerberg said. “I mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues. But they can’t put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company.”

The 35-year-old tech titan publicly acknowledged on Tuesday that the comments were indeed his, saying that he often shares ""openly what I'm thinking on all kinds of projects and issues.""

""The transcript from one of my Q&As a few months ago just got published online -- and even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it's out there, you can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics like social responsibility, breaking up tech companies, Libra, neural computing interfaces, and doing the right thing over the long term,"" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook.

Warren responded to the story, tweeting that the system that allows ""giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices"" needs to be fixed.

Later in the afternoonon Tuesday, Warren expanded on her plans to break up Big Tech, explaining that even after a breakup, ""you'll still be able to use Facebook and Instagram to catch up with friends and family and share photos of your dog.""

""Imagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security,"" the top-tier 2020 presidential contender said on Twitter.

A Facebook spokesperson described the D.C. meetings as ""good"" and ""constructive,"" aimed at ""meeting with policymakers to hear their concerns and talk about future Internet regulation."" Trump also tweeted an image last month of himself shaking hands with Zuckerberg at the White House.

In March, Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic Senator from Massachusetts, put forth a plan that would break up the largest tech companies in the country, chiefly Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, saying the power they hold is too great.

""I want a government that makes sure everybody — even the biggest and most powerful companies in America — plays by the rules,"" Warren wrote in a blog post announcing her plan. ""And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish.

ZUCKERBERG SAYS THERE 'CLEARLY WAS BIAS' IN CONTROVERSY OVER 'CENSORSHIP' OF PRO-LIFE GROUP LIVE ACTION

In her plan, Warren specifically mentioned that she wants to unwind Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, an idea that has gained traction on both sides of the political aisle.

During his meetings with D.C. lawmakers, Zuckerberg met with Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has proposed a bill to ban features that enable limitless scrolling, autoplay and other addictive features on social media. Hawley said on Twitter that he asked the Facebook founder to show he was ""serious about bias, privacy & competition"" and sell WhatsApp and Instagram as well as submit to a third-party audit on censorship.

""He said no to both,"" Hawley tweeted.

Sen. Hawley has also announced legislation that would remove tech titans’ protection from liability for third-party content on their platforms. Under the Ending Internet Censorship Act, these companies are able to ""retain Section 230 protections if they prove they are politically neutral to a third-party auditor,"" a Hawley spokesperson told Fox News.

Zuckerberg's visit to Washington came amid a fraught period for Facebook, with lawmakers calling for closer scrutiny of the company amid privacy and censorship bias concerns. Facebook currently faces an anti-trust probe led by state attorneys general as well as a separate antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

That agency slapped Facebook with a $5 billion fine over the company’s privacy policies, and the company agreed to enact new oversight on how the company utilizes user data.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for floating the idea of a wealth tax, claiming it could stifle economic growth and reshape the entire economy.

""Their plans envision an enormous transfer of money from the wealthy to ordinary people, with revenue from the wealth tax used to finance new social programs like tuition-free college, universal childcare and 'Medicare for all,'"" authors Alan Rappeport and Thomas Kaplan wrote.

If rolled out, the plan would deal a massive blow to the coffers of the richest Americans.

""The idea of redistributing wealth by targeting billionaires is stirring fierce debates at the highest ranks of academia and business, with opponents arguing it would cripple economic growth, sap the motivation of entrepreneurs who aspire to be multimillionaires and set off a search for loopholes,"" the op-ed reads.

BERNIE SANDERS CLAIMS 'MEDICARE-FOR--ALL' WILL SLASH HEALTH CARE COSTS WITH TAX HIKE

""Redirecting such vast sums could have unintended effects on the United States economy that go beyond promulgating economic fairness. While Ms. Warren ticks off the social programs that can be funded if the richest Americans pay just 2 cents on every dollar they have above $50 million -- a number that is unimaginable to most Americans -- skeptics warn of economic stagnation, depressed business confidence and a legal battle that would go to the Supreme Court.""

The op-ed also cites growing skepticism among far-left economists, as well as business leaders, as to the viability of such a plan.

""Outnumbered"" also tackled the story on Tuesday, with Fox News contributor Kristen Soltis Anderson calling it a misleading proposal that will negatively trickle down to the middle-class.

""The reason why they make these claims and... always get a little more cagey when you ask how is this going change the tax burden on the average American -- is 70 percent of people in this country consider themselves middle-class,"" she said.

""They think, it's not going to affect me. Well, the reality is... if it's affecting economic growth, if it's affecting unemployment, it will affect you... The math doesn’t add up on a lot of these programs to be able to pay for them, just by slapping more taxes on the rich.""

Despite the criticisms, ultimately the op-ed endorsed the idea of a wealth tax, calling it a ""political winner"" that could help defeat President Trump in 2020.

The Sanders presidential campaign said Tuesday it will spend $1.3 million to run the ads starting Thursday in Iowa, the state that kicks off the primary and caucus nominating calendar.

""If this impeachment thing falls apart -- you know, as some people think it might -- if it falls apart and [the Chinese] intuit that Donald Trump's going to be reelected we'll have a deal very soon,"" said Andy Puzder, former chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants and President Trump's former nominee for U.S. labor secretary. ""But if they feel there's a challenge... to his presidency they'll wait.""

U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and top Chinese officials are set to meet in Washington this month to potentially restart talks that have been stalled since May.

Puzder added that if the Chinese are unsure of what may happen in the 2020 election, then they will delay.

""Why wouldn't you wait? You're not going to end up with somebody on the other side that's going to be as good at this as [Trump] is. So why not wait?"" said Puzder, arguing that the Chinese see Trump as the most difficult possible negotiating partner.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

Wall Street Journal Editorial Page Assistant Editor and Fox News contributor James Freeman suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping may be more willing to negotiate with Trump than his potential Democratic Presidential opponent, Senator Elizabeth Warren D-Mass.

Warren's position is, ""more hard-line and... economically destructive than Trump's tariffs because she's saying 'I'm going to tariff not just for economic reasons but for environmental ones as well,'"" said Freeman.

In a recent blog post, Warren wrote, ""We’ve let China get away with the suppression of pay and labor rights, poor environmental protections, and years of currency manipulation.""

Puzder questioned if Warren would ""have the political strength"" to follow through on her position, but he conceded that the debate over confronting the Chinese has shifted dramatically.

""Look, this has become a bipartisan issue. Everybody seems to agree -- we need to do something with China and it was not a bipartisan [issue] right back to three years ago,"" said Puzder.

Fox Business Network Susan Li agreed with that sentiment and added that a number of business leaders are also backing the trade war.

""It's surprising, actually. A lot of the big CEOs are also on board with this -- that we should get tougher with China. I thought that they would be upset because it hurt their stock price ... it capped the amount on the stock market. But they say, 'No, this is something that should have been taken care of a few decades ago,'"" said Li.

Puzder concluded that U.S. companies are supporting the President's push to hold China accountable because they now believe that they may benefit financially.

""What we've got is... a president who kind of unified the country around this idea that we're going to stand up to China. So now businesses are willing to stand up, individuals are willing, politicians on the other side of the aisle are willing, so now is the time. We really can't let this slip away.""

“Not a day goes by that we don't get a call from somebody wanting us to attend a function or two or trying to become involved in our [community],” said Melendez.

The strategy could pay off. While the Native American population in the country remains relatively small, at about 1.5 percent of the general population, they make up a sizable portion of eligible voters in several states or districts, according to data from the National Congress of American Indians, or NCAI. The numbers continue to grow.

ELIZABETH WARREN REVISITS DNA TEST APOLOGIZES TO NATIVE AMERICANS

“[The population] has grown 27 percent since the year 2000. We're a younger crowd that is getting more visible, more educated, more active,” said Kevin Allis, CEO of NCAI.

As more Native Americans gain access to the polls, the voting bloc, which has previously complained about being overlooked, could be pivotal in key primary states like Iowa, Arizona, and Nevada. The latter two states have relatively large Native populations (Nevada has 27 federally recognized tribes) that could make a significant difference.

During the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., reportedly earned 83.3 percent of the Indian Settlement precinct votes after visiting the Meskwaki settlement. He has credited those votes for helping him almost beat U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: WE NEED AN ECONOMY AND GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL, NOT JUST THE 1 PERCENT

“From top to bottom, in all the different elections, you can see where the margins are that thin. We really have an opportunity to make a difference,” Allis said.

To improve turnout, many Native American voting activists have called for better access to the polls. They say the issue is most pressing in rural areas where some tribal lands may be more than a hundred miles away from a polling location.

“I think Native Americans sometimes are reluctant to go to try to find where the voting site is in the city. But if we can bring those voting sites out to reservation lands, I think we'll have a better turnout,” said Melendez.

Some of the main issues for Indian country include climate change and addressing the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. But, above all, they’ve called for the federal government to honor the agreements laid out in treaties with Native American nations.

“Native Americans have given up millions of acres of land in exchange for those promises of health care, of law enforcement, all those different governmental needs that we have,” said Melendez.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have rolled out policy proposals targeting Native Americans. They touched on some of those plans in August during the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, which was organized by the non-profit organization, Four Directions Inc., and considered the first forum in history to exclusively cover Native American issues.

There, Warren apologized for her highly criticized use of a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry. Her proposal was largely seen as an attempt to soften the blowback from the controversy, which angered many Native Americans and continues to haunt her campaign.

“We really have an opportunity to make a difference, and the candidates are running for office really need to understand that those numbers matter and can win or lose a particular election,” he said.

Today, all of the different constituencies which make up the Democratic Party are united behind this effort to hold the president accountable. Having worked on the Hill for a House Democrat, I can attest that getting Democrats all on the same page is no easy task.

But impeachment doesn’t change the long-term realities for Democrats: Republicans in the Senate will almost certainly acquit the president, which means removing Trump from the Oval Office will require Democrats to win the presidential election in 2020, by nominating a candidate who speaks to both the practical concerns of battleground voters and the aspirations of the most ardent idealists in the party.

Asserting the president will survive his impeachment battle is not a comment on whether I believe Trump unlawfully used his office for political gain in his negotiations with the Ukraine. It’s the reality of the current political dynamics on Capitol Hill, where Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided and have different sets of facts on everything from climate change to gun control.

INDEPENDENTS TORN OVER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IN NEW POLL

No matter what Democrats turn up in their impeachment investigation, there is little reason to believe that more than a handful of Republicans on Capitol Hill will abandon the president and vote for impeachment in either the House or the Senate.

After all, as long as Trump’s popularity with Republican voters remains over 90 percent, any Republican who breaks ranks by siding with Democrats will be savaged by his or her fellow Republicans.

As for the House Democrats, Speaker Pelosi is taking the right steps on impeachment. She is seeking to get it done as fast as possible. This will help ensure that the centrist Democrats, who hold the key to the majority and her Speakership, can run for reelection in 2020, not focused on impeachment. After all, these moderate Democrats did not campaign on impeaching the President, but rather on issues like health care.

She is also avoiding more spectacles in the House Judiciary Committee, like what we saw when Corey Lewandowski made a mockery of the “impeachment” hearing.

That being said, if Trump is impeached by the House, and acquitted by the Senate, how does this impact the battle for the White House in 2020?

This is not good news for Joe Biden. Republicans are going to relentlessly assail his son’s business dealings with Ukraine. This is already happening, and it is vintage Donald Trump to try and downplay his own ethical transgressions by insisting his opponent did the same thing, or worse.

Even before this whole Ukraine situation flared up, the former Vice President was losing ground in the polls. While Joe Biden served President Barack Obama honorably and loyally, and is popular with many Democrats, questions about why his son had a $50,000 a month contract with a Ukrainian gas company will not be helpful.

Also, it won’t be long before Joe Biden’s rivals in the Democratic primary start making an issue out of this situation with his son and the Ukraine. Politics is a rough business, so how can they not attack the front runner if they hope to take the nomination from him?

However, what is bad for Joe Biden, is good for the left-leaning Senator Elizabeth Warren and the other Democrats hoping to be the nominee in 2020. But what remains unclear, is if Sen. Warren becomes the Democratic nominee for President, will she unite minorities and centrists with her progressive base? Don’t underestimate Warren; to date, she has run the smartest campaign of any Democrat running for the White House.

But whether or not Sen. Warren can attract centrists and minorities with her ultra-progressive policies and rhetoric remains to be seen. If not, she could outperform Hillary Clinton in New York, California and other solidly Democratic regions but struggle to win the key battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which will likely decide who is the next President. Recent polls show progress for Democrats in these states, but they remain crucial.

On the flip side, Trump – despite a high probability of being impeached – is likely to go into the 2020 election with a united and motivated Republican Party. If past is prologue, impeaching a president who is ultimately acquitted in the Senate, motivates voters in the president’s party.

Ultimately, I believe Trump will survive his impeachment. Biden may be another story. It is hard to see how he comes out of this chapter in American history with his candidacy intact.

Hence, the question facing Democrats is: Can any of the other potential nominees unite the party and win in the key swing states? One way or another, democracy marches on and we will find out next year.

TRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL

Democrats recently announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump over a whistleblower's claim that the president, who'd put a freeze on millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, improperly pushed that country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, during a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma as his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.

A Monmouth University survey suggests that Biden – one of the co-frontrunners in the Democratic race to face off next year against the president – could suffer some political damage from the Ukrainian allegations that sparked the Democrat-controlled House to formally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

POLL SUGGESTS SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT GROWS, WITH AMERICANS NOW SPLIT

The survey, released Wednesday, indicates that a plurality of voters believed Trump’s accusations against Biden on that issue.

Trump and Biden each face a distinct set of allegations with regard to Ukraine. Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their dealings in Ukraine. A whistleblower, along with Democrats, argue Trump in essence was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly described his phone call with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

At the same time, the president has sought to turn the tables on Biden by highlighting allegations against the former vice president and his son that he wanted investigated.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed. Trump’s re-election campaign last week launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his alleged actions.

The Monmouth poll indicates that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure.

Among crucial self-identified independent voters, 39 percent believe that Biden pressured Ukrainian officials, with 27 percent disagreeing and a third unsure.

“The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

Biden's allies maintain he intervened in Ukraine over corruption concerns, not because of his son's work.

And Biden once again emphasized on Wednesday that ""there’s zero, zero evidence, of any assertion made.""

The survey also spells trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be re-elected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

“Trump’s base is sticking with him, but these results suggest that the president remains particularly weak among voting blocs that were crucial to putting him over the top in 2016,” Murray said.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The survey is also the latest to indicate the race for the Democratic nomination is turning into a two-candidate battle between Biden and progressive champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Warren stands at 28 percent support among self-identified Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, with the former vice president at 25 percent. Warren’s advantage is within the survey’s sampling error.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run, stands at 15 percent. Biden, Sanders and Warren were all tied in Monmouth’s previous poll, conducted in August.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 5 percent in the survey, along with Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Tech-entrepreneur Andrew Yang and best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson are at 2 percent in the poll, with 11 other contenders in the record-setting Democratic field registering at 1 percent or less.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Sept. 23-29, with 1,161 people questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

""In the entire eight years that Obama was president, incomes only budged up about $1,000, so in one-third of the time, Trump has increased income by four times as much. We now have a median income of 65,000 dollars. That shows pretty clearly that the middle-class has been benefiting,” he added.

In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.

The release of the independent senator from Vermont's ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.

Moore argued that Democrats are going to have a hard time proving to Americans that their economic policies will be better.

“If these numbers hold up, it’s going to be difficult for any Democrat to beat Donald Trump because he’s proven to be the blue-collar president,” Moore said.

He acknowledged, however, that there was a poor report Tuesday on U.S. manufacturing and exports.

The ISM September Manufacturing Index slipped to 47.8, down 1.3 percentage points from August. A read below 50 signals contraction. More worrisome is new export orders, which hit 41 percent, a 2.3 percentage point drop from last month.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Wednesday announced the lineup for their Oct. 15 fourth-round presidential primary debate, and as expected, 12 candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria.

That means the showdown will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order – former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – with lower qualifying thresholds – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. The thresholds were raised for the third-round debate, resulting in 10 candidates facing off on one night.

The DNC announced last week that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by Tuesday’s deadline.

2020 DEMOCRATIC FIELD POISED FOR NEW PURGE WITH KEY DEADLINES APPROACHING

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention.

Steyer told Fox News on Wednesday that “the DNC makes decisions and I try not to think about them.”

He emphasized that “the debates are a huge opportunity and that’s how I hope to use them,” but he also acknowledged that “if there are more people on the stage, then it’s harder, and I just have to deal with that.”

The Oct. 15 debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The DNC’s media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times."

The massive fundraising figure is up more than $7 million from his second-quarter numbers.

SANDERS PROPOSES NEW TAX TO TARGET COMPANIES WITH LARGE PAY GAPS

Pete Buttigieg’s campaign also reported early Tuesday morning that the South Bend, Indiana mayor raised $19.1 million the past three months. While impressive, the candidate’s fundraising haul is down from the $24.8 million he brought in during the second quarter, which was the highest among the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls during the April-June quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris announced raising $11.6 million over the past three months.

The California Democrat's third quarter figure is slightly behind the $11.8 million she brought in during the second quarter and the $12 million she hauled in during the January-March first quarter of fundraising.

Sen. Cory Booker also revealed his third-quarter fundraising figures on Tuesday.

The Democrat from New Jersey's presidential campaign said they raised more than $6 million in July-September period, their best quarter of fundraising to date.

President Trump’s re-election campaign reported on Tuesday that they and the Republican National Committee combined hauled in a massive $125 million in the third quarter. That’s up from their combined $105 million raised during the second quarter.

Unlike some of his rivals for the nomination – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Buttigieg and Harris – Sanders eschews big donor fundraisers and instead relies solely on grassroots donations. The campaign announced it received 1.4 million donations the past three months.

Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement that ""Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations – both in the primary and in the general.""

News of Sanders’ cash haul comes as the populist independent senator from Vermont has faded in many recent polls to third place behind Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who along with Sanders is the other progressive standard-bearer in the 2020 Democratic nomination race.

Shakir argued that “media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.""

The Sanders campaign announced that its average individual contribution was $19 and that more than 99.9 percent of contributors have not maxed out and are able to donate again to the campaign.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The Buttigieg campaign highlighted that they’ve now raised more than $51 million since the beginning of the year. They said that 182,000 new people contributed to the campaign in the third quarter, bringing the total number of donors this year to 580,000. The campaign also reported that the average contribution the past three months was $32.

Buttigieg, a one-time long-shot for the nomination, soared in the spring to near top-tier status. While he's continued to haul in large amounts of campaign cash and build up a formidable team in the crucial early voting states, his poll numbers stagnated during the summer.

The Harris campaign, in reporting their fundraising figures, noted that they plan to double their organizing staff in Iowa and South Carolina - the first southern primary - in October and November.

Harris has seen her poll numbers deteriorate over the past two months, but campaign manager Juan Rodriguez pledged that ""this is a campaign that is growing, expanding, and built to win this primary.""

Booker's campaign said that a third of their campaign haul the past three months came during the last 10 days of September, after the candidate announced if he didn't bring in $1.7 million by end of the month, he'd likely drop his White House bid.

Booker's campaign said they'd use their new infusion of campaign cash to hire 40 more staff at headquarters and across the country and open more offices in the early voting states.

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to officially file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. The third-quarter fundraising figures of the Democratic presidential candidates will be heavily analyzed and scrutinized. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel, and ads."

Bob Inglis, R-S.C., and another South Carolina Republican filed a lawsuit Tuesday claiming that the state's Republican Party is breaking its own rules and South Carolina law in canceling its 2020 presidential primary, according to a report.

The lawsuit, first reported by The Post and Courier, argues that while it is not a requirement that the state party hold a primary every presidential election year, party rules dictate the decision to cancel the presidential primary must be made by a vote at the state party convention. The South Carolina GOP did not follow that rule ⁠— its executive committee made the decision unilaterally ⁠— and therefore, the lawsuit claims, it is in violation of South Carolina law, which requires parties to follow their own rules.

""These procedural safeguards make sense: a switch from a primary to a party convention is potentially worrying because it does not provide the same opportunity to the voters to have as significant an input into the political process,"" the lawsuit says. ""Party conventions carry with them a far higher risk that the views of few party bosses could override the will of the party’s general members.""

The South Carolina Republican Party's rationale for canceling the 2020 primary was that it would save taxpayer money. Following the decision on Sept. 7, the party said in a statement that its decision would conserve $1.2 million and was not unprecedented ⁠— the South Carolina Republican Party skipped presidential primaries in 1984 and 2004 and the South Carolina Democrats did the same in 1996 and 2012.

""As a general rule, when either party has an incumbent President in the White House, there's no rationale to hold a primary,"" SCGOP Chairman Drew McKissick said in the statement. ""President Trump and his administration have delivered for South Carolinians, and we look forward to ensuring that the Republican candidates up and down the ballot are elected in 2020.""

McKissick and the South Carolina Republican Party are the two named defendants in the suit.

Leonard and his wife, Amanda, have property at Baker's Bay just east of Great Abaco in the Bahamas, and she was on a text chain with a woman who lives in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, and had a home near Baker's Bay. The woman, Beth Warren, was hosting families and sharing tales of the devastation and the needs.

The answer was a collaboration with player and analyst Brad Faxon and Seth Waugh, the retired Deutsche Bank Americas CEO and now president of the PGA of America. That resulted in the ""Bahamas Strong Pro-Am"" to be held Oct. 8 at Old Marsh Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

Registration is closed because the pro-am of 22 groups already sold out. Donations are still being sought through the website and all proceeds go directly to relief efforts.

The field has some star power — Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Ernie Els and Justin Thomas are among 19 players already enlisted.

Leonard said his only experience with such events was a charity spin class that raised $100,000 annually for a camp for children coping with cancer. He at least knew the right people to call. It started with PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, mainly to get contact information for Waugh. And then he got Faxon involved to help find a golf course and players.

""Fax opened up his Rolodex, which is way more extensive than mine, and we started sending texts and emails,"" Leonard said.

They had to move quickly, especially with the PGA Tour and LPGA Tour heading for Asia. The only logical date was Oct. 8, which gave them a month to get to work. Thomas, who vacations at Baker's Bay, was among the first to sign up. Nicklaus, Norman and Els added Hall of Fame cachet.

Others include Jessica Korda, Marina Alex, Leta Lindley and Jaye Greene from the LPGA Tour, Lucas Glover, Billy Horschel, Corey Conners, Charl Schwartzel, Rory Sabbatini, Brett Quigley, Jesper Parnevik, Leonard and Faxon. The latest to sign up was Joaquin Niemann of Chile.

""There's so much they need before they can even think about rebuilding,"" Warren told Golf Digest. ""There is a lot of need and a lot of confusion down there.""

END OF THE ROAD

The LPGA Tour is in Texas this week, and it could be the end of the season some two months before the season actually ends.

The Volunteers of America Classic north of Dallas is the final full-field event of the year before the LPGA Tour heads to Asia for four weeks and then concludes at the CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida, the week before Thanksgiving.

At stake for some, like Cristie Kerr, is a chance to reach the Tour Championship. For others, like Paula Creamer and Gerina Piller, it's a matter of making sure they have full LPGA Tour cards for next year. Creamer is No. 89 while Piller is No. 91. Both were on the U.S. Solheim Cup team two years ago.

The top 100 on the Race to the CME Globe keep their full cards, but this could be the last week to earn points. The four Asian events — China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan — have sponsor exemptions, but any LPGA Tour member who gets into the tournament through an exemption is not eligible to earn Race to CME Globe points.

The field for three Asia events is for the top 62 on the LPGA points list, with only 43 spots in Japan. Not everyone plays. Lexi Thompson, for example, plans to play only the Toto Japan Classic, so the availability dips down beyond No. 62.

For some players, it's a matter of how far. Kerr is at No. 69. She currently is the third alternate for the Buick LPGA Shanghai and the fifth alternate for the Taiwan Swinging Skirts LPGA.

Jennifer Kupcho, who deferred her membership until June so she could finish at Wake Forest, is at No. 59.

All but four players — Haru Nomura, Mel Reid, Mariajo Uribe and Alison Lee — from No. 61 through No. 100 is in the field in the Volunteers of America Classic.

MUIRFIELD MODIFICATIONS

Jack Nicklaus isn't done tinkering with his Muirfield Village, though he calls the next improvements ""my last bite at the apple.""

The home of the Memorial announced a two-phase project that Nicklaus will oversee for the next two years. When all the work is finished, the par-5 fifth hole will play as par 4 for the Memorial, making par 71 for the first time.

The work starts this fall with three new tees for the par-3 eighth and both par 5s on the back nine, Nos. 11 and 15. The course will tip out at 7,462 yards — it was at 6,978 yards when the Memorial was first played in 1974.

The work is expected to be ready for the PGA Tour event the first week in June, with Patrick Cantlay the defending champion.

Then, the course will close a month after the Memorial to rebuild all 18 greens, including new sub-surface heating and cooling. Bunkers will be rebuilt, tees levels and the irrigation system updated. Nicklaus said fairways will be grassed, but the widths will remain generous.

Nicklaus said the par-5 fifth hole will be redesigned after next year's tournament to create a larger landing area off the tee. He is hopeful it will allow more players to hit driver off the tee and then have a mid-iron over the water onto the green.

""I've done little tweaks on the golf course throughout the years, and some significant changes, like the par-3 16th,"" Nicklaus said. ""This time, we are going through the golf course, A to Z, and making sure we do everything at one time.""

Nicklaus said he will add more forward tees for the members at Muirfield Village.

""But my belief is that tournament golf should be a test to find out who is the best golfer that week,"" he said. ""Far too many tournaments have eliminated the rough and firmness of greens, and that is just not my idea of what the game of golf should be.""

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT JUMPS 10 POINTS

Quinnipiac University: “American voters are divided on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, 47 - 47 percent - closing a 20 point gap from less than a week ago, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released [Monday]. In the poll released on September 25th, voters said that the president should not be impeached and removed 57 - 37 percent. Among the political party subgroups, Democrats showed the greatest change from the last poll. [Monday], they show a virtual consensus on impeaching Trump, 90 - 5 percent, while last week they said Trump should be impeached 73 - 21 percent. … While voters are split on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, a slim majority of registered voters do approve of the impeachment inquiry opened by the U.S. House of Representatives 52 - 45 percent. Approval includes half of independents, who are split 50 - 45 percent on the inquiry.”



No change in job approval - Monmouth University: “President Donald Trump’s approval rating has remained steady in the wake of an official impeachment inquiry launched last week, although support for impeachment has ticked up slightly. In a two year Monmouth University Poll trend on impeachment opinion the current findings are not out of line with some prior results. … Trump’s overall job rating stands at 41% approve and 53% disapprove, which is similar to his 40% to 53% rating in August. … At this time, 44% of Americans feel that Trump should be impeached and compelled to leave the presidency, while 52% disagree with this course of action. These numbers mark a shift from Monmouth’s prior poll in August (35% supported impeachment and 59% did not), but it is not the first time these results have been found in the two years Monmouth has been asking this question.”



The war room is the Oval Office - Politico: “A week after House Democrats jump-started their impeachment inquiry, the White House has yet to converge on any single plan, strategy or even unified messaging to fight back. All the talk about setting up a so-called war room inside the West Wing, similar to the approach of the Clinton White House, has gone nowhere. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, other top aides, lawyers and Trump advisers have been jockeying among their own internal factions for control of the approach or messaging. … The infighting over the fate of a war room reflects the long-standing operational styles of the Trump White House and 2016 campaign over the past four years, during which personnel battles often overshadowed any well-honed strategy. The president has always preferred to run his White House with a team-of-rivals approach, with aides fighting over various policies or political options and Trump alone as the decider at the center of the action. The impeachment battle may be no different.”



Giuliani called to testify - Fox News: “The chairmen of three House committees subpoenaed President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Monday for key documents related to the Ukraine controversy as part of their formal impeachment inquiry against Trump. ‘Pursuant to the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry, we are hereby transmitting a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the accompanying schedule by October 15, 2019,’ Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, all Democrats, wrote. … The committee chairs subpoenaed Giuliani after claiming he admitted to being ‘in possession of evidence — in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications — indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump administration officials may have been involved in this scheme.’”

And at the National Press Photographers Association headquarters at the University of Georgia journalism school, it hangs in a place of special honor with four other photos of epic moments in history­ — President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signing the declaration of war in 1941; Huey Long, the controversial Louisiana politician, making a campaign speech; the skeletal Hindenberg being consumed in a hellish inferno, and Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima. How could a photo like this not win a Pulitzer? Because the Post-​Gazette didn’t run it. And how could any paper not publish a photo of this magnitude? There are various stories on that.

BERNIE BANKS BIG CASH, BUT BUTTIGIEG WOWS

WaPo: “Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised $25.3 million during the past three months for his White House bid, his campaign said Tuesday, fueled by an army of low-dollar donors to post the largest quarterly haul so far this year among the Democratic presidential contenders. Sanders transferred an additional $2.6 million from his other federal campaign accounts, the campaign said. The third-quarter figures announced by the campaign rival his $26 million haul at this point in the primary campaign in 2015, when he stunned the Democratic field by nearly matching the total of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, with an infusion of money from donors giving less than $200. Yet this time, he is facing more than a dozen opponents. One of them, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, announced early Tuesday that his campaign raised more than $19.1 million in the third quarter — less than Sanders did but an amount that gives him staying power in a crowded field.”



Harris shuffles staff as candidacy flounders - Politico: “Kamala Harris is shaking up the top ranks of her presidential campaign, the latest sign her once-promising bid is failing to meet expectations. The staff moves amount to a significant reorganization for a campaign that’s dropped so far in polls that it risks becoming a postscript in the Democratic primary. Harris’ light early-state schedule, hiccups on the trail and lack of consistency in delivering her message have consumed much of the attention and blame for her mounting struggles. Behind the scenes, aides said a lack of clarity among staff surrounding the roles of Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez and Campaign Chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, and inexperience across the organization are feeding a growing sense of indecision and aimlessness inside the campaign. … The campaign did not start holding regular senior staff meetings until September — nine months after launching — leading to a lack of coordination across departments.”



GOP FUNDRAISING PLATFORM OPENS BIG

Fox News: “WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete with Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations, has raised more than $30 million since launching three months ago, with top officials crediting the Democrats’ impeachment push for a big spike in fundraising over the last week, Fox News has learned. WinRed raised just over $30 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday. The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump’s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country. In an interview, WinRed's president, Gerrit Lansing, said the Democrats’ moves to ramp up impeachment efforts against Trump ‘helped a lot,’ saying fundraising numbers ‘spiked’ after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement of a formal inquiry last week. WinRed has raised over $13.7 million from over 276,000 contributors since the announcement from Pelosi, D-Calif., he said.”



ZUCK TELLS WORKERS HE’D BATTLE WARREN

Fox News: “Leaked audio comments from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly include him saying that the tech company would likely have no choice but to sue the U.S. government to stave off being broken up if Elizabeth Warren becomes president. The comments, obtained by The Verge, span a wide range of topics and deep insight into Zuckerberg's thinking, going much further than the usually stoic CEO appears in public. ‘You have someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,’ Zuckerberg is quoted as saying in two Q&A sessions with Facebook employees during July.”



Court upholds 2017 ruling cancelling net neutrality rules - WaPo: “A federal appeals court on Tuesday affirmed that the Federal Communications Commission acted lawfully when it scrapped the U.S. government’s net neutrality rules in 2017, but it opened the door for state and local governments to introduce their own regulations designed to treat all web traffic equally. … In a nearly 200-page opinion, judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals largely sided with the Federal Communications Commission and its Republican chairman, Ajit Pai. While the agency must return to the drawing board on some elements of its repeal, the court upheld the breadth of its work, finding that net neutrality supporters had made ‘unconvincing’ arguments in their efforts to override the FCC’s deregulation of companies such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon.”

“There is an element of feeling a little bit like a traveling troubadour.” – Andrew Yang to CNN explaining that his rallies make him feel more like a traveling musician than a political candidate.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘….you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old Andy Johnson.’ I’m one of those historians. His impeachment in 1868 was purely political because the radical republicans didn’t like a Democrat who didn’t share their views on implementing a harsh Reconstruction on the Old Confederacy. In fact one of the 11 articles of impeachment included a notation that he was unable to get along with the Congress (or words to that effect). All the other impeachments – Nixon, Clinton – involved criminal activity by the President. Now it appears we have another Johnsonian impeachment looming. The only thing that saved Johnson was the lobbying by Thomas Ewing Jr. of Kansas Senator Edmund Ross. Ewing was a well-known lobbyist in Washington after the war and had defended several of the Lincoln conspirators (Dr. Mudd). Ross was a radical republican who ended up being the key vote against impeachment. Ewing was Ross’ old commanding officer in the 11th Kansas Infantry during the Civil War.” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.



[Ed. note: I knew you were out there somewhere, Mr. Smith! Thank you for sharing that fabulous Kansas fact. I would only quibble with your assessment to say this: All impeachments are political. It is the nature of the enterprise. Now, I certainly agree that what the radical Republicans did to Johnson was pretty shoddy, he was also a spectacularly terrible president. He did not need to take the bait that Congress put out in front of him. Our point in discussing impeachment is that many presidents have done rotten things and not been impeached for them and a few presidents have done rotten things and been impeached for them. It is an entirely subjective decision.]



“Thank you for your 9/26/19 article regarding your plan to cover the politics at play in the upcoming impeachment inquiry, in an unbiased manner. As a long time reader, I've always appreciated your fairness when reporting on events that are very charged with emotion for much of us. I am a liberal Democrat, so clearly I'm not a supporter of President Trump. So it is very easy to get drawn into the ‘echo chamber’ at times, even though I try my best to resist. Your newsletter certainly helps me to be able to appreciate the views on both sides, even if I don't agree. I look forward to your upcoming articles, during what is sure to be a very painful and frustrating period for both ‘teams.’” – Holly Stilo, Lawrenceville, Ga.



[Ed. note: Thank you so much for your kind words, Ms. Stilo. It is quite pleasant to not be a “team” player at times like this. I wish for the health of the republic and all good things for my countrymen, but we have reached a saturation point with the negative partisanship that pervades our system. It’s time for the teams to fight it out. We will be here to watch the festivities and will endeavor to keep a level head throughout.]



“…I get tired of hearing everybody blaming the current political dysfunction on Trump. They are missing the point. In 2016 the Cubs won the World Series, irreparably damaging the space-time continuum and creating chaos in the universe and calling into question the meaning of life itself. Shortly thereafter, Trump was elected President of the United States. I leave it to you: Trump or the Cubs?” – George Fuller, St. Louis



[Ed. note: Then it’s very good news that on Sunday the Cardinals closed the rift in the space-time continuum by beating the little bears and taking their rightful place atop the National League Central Division.]

DETROIT ROCK CITY

AP: “Motorists traveling through a Detroit suburb were stunned to see a pornographic video playing on an electronic billboard. Auburn Hills police say the video played on the billboard along Interstate 75 in Oakland County for about 30 minutes Saturday night before the images were removed. Many people called 911. Chuck McMahon says he saw the video and wondered if the billboard was advertising for a strip club. Investigators tell WDIV-TV that two people apparently broke into a small building at the site and loaded porn on a laptop that’s connected to the billboard. Two men wearing hooded sweatshirts were spotted on security video. Police are asking the public to help identify them. Dr. Justin Kammo also saw the video. He says he immediately assumed that ‘someone had hacked it.’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The New York subway is a place where the rules nominally apply, but only nominally. The problem is more than the breakdown of law. It is the breakdown of order.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on June 24, 2001.

On the roster: Sanders off the trail with heart problems - Huge cash haul for trump - Trump’s team embraces ‘coup’ claim - Pete Sessions goes district shopping - Dana Perino wanted for questioning

SANDERS OFF THE TRAIL WITH HEART PROBLEMS

AP: “Bernie Sanders’ campaign says the Democratic presidential candidate has had a heart procedure for a blocked artery. The Vermont senator is canceling events and appearances ‘until further notice.’ The campaign says the 78-year-old Sanders experienced chest discomfort during an event Tuesday and sought medical evaluation. The campaign says two stents were ‘successfully inserted’ and that Sanders ‘is conversing and in good spirits.’ His campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, was on a telephone call with supporters Tuesday night but didn’t mention any health concerns about the candidate. Shakir said the ‘state of the campaign is strong’ and he played up Sanders’ strong fundraising total for the third quarter. Sanders recently canceled some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. The campaign said at the time he felt fine.”



Biden still strong in South Carolina - Greenville [S.C.] News: “The latest Winthrop Poll results are out and South Carolina democratic voters strongly support former Vice President Joe Biden for the presidency, according to the results. Biden drew 37% of the votes among those surveyed. Among African American democrats and democratic-leaning African Americans, Biden earned 46% of the votes, according to the poll. This is the first Winthrop Poll looking at the 2020 primary candidates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren earned 17%, Sen. Bernie Sanders 8%, Sen. Kamala Harris 7% and the remaining 15 candidates each earned less than 5% support in the poll. … The Winthrop Poll is among the list of qualifying polls [for debate qualifications]. Of the remaining 15 candidates, only South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker earned at least 3% approval.”



Warren, Biden neck in neck in New Hampshire - WMUR: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now in a virtual dead heat with former Vice President Joe Biden in the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary campaign, according to a new poll. The latest Saint Anselm College Center Survey Center poll shows that Warren’s overall upward trajectory is evident in New Hampshire, as it has been recently in national polls. … Sen. Bernie Sanders, the landslide winner of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, is in third place with 11 percent, essentially tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was backed by 10 percent of those polled. … Sen. Kamala Harris was the top choice of 5 percent, while U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Amy Klobuchar received 3 percent each. Philanthropist/activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang each received support from 2 percent of those polled, while Sen. Cory Booker was backed by 1 percent.”



Yang brings in big bucks with free money plan - Axios: “2020 candidate Andrew Yang's campaign says it raised $10 million in 2019's third quarter, according to Politico. Why it matters: Yang's Q3 report is more than triple the $2.8 million he raised in the second quarter — a push powered by some strong debate performances that elevated his national profile. The state of play: Yang outpaced Sen. Cory Booker’s $6 million and came close to Sen. Kamala Harris’ $11.6 million. … Yang's campaign said nearly 300,000 people have donated — almost double the threshold required to qualify for the November debate. … Yang's campaign told Politico that it received $1 million in the 72 hours after the September debate in which he announced that he was giving away $120,000 to 10 families over a year to promote signature campaign proposal: universal basic income, branded by Yang as the ‘freedom dividend.’”



HUGE CASH HAUL FOR TRUMP

AP: “President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter of the year, a presidential fundraising record. The pro-Trump effort said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank. Republicans aim to use the fundraising haul to fight off Democrats’ impeachment effort. Former President Barack Obama and the DNC raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011. ‘President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,’ said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers.”



GOP moves to stifle dissent in Charlotte - NYT: “President Trump’s political advisers have concluded a monthslong effort to tighten the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, all but ensuring there are no dissenting speeches at the gathering of party officials in Charlotte next year. On Tuesday, state Republican parties submitted to the national committee their delegate allocation plans, the methods by which they will choose and bind delegates who attend the convention as their representatives. In 37 states and territories, there have been changes to the rules that will all but stamp out the possibility of any raucous divide on the convention floor. … The new delegate guidelines are the culmination of a 10-month effort by Trump advisers to strengthen the president’s grip on the Republican Party ahead of the general election. It means that even if the three candidates challenging Mr. Trump in the Republican primary gain vote shares, they almost certainly won’t translate into speeches or jeers from supporters of these candidates when the convention is taking place.”



South Carolina Republicans sue over nixed primary - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Two Republicans, one of them former congressman Bob Inglis, have sued the S.C. Republican Party over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state court in Richland County, alleges the party scrapped its 2020 election contest illegally and violated party rules and state election law. The suit further contends the near-unanimous decision made by the party’s Executive Committee deprives Inglis, of Greenville, and fellow plaintiff Frank Heindel of Mount Pleasant, of their right to vote for the candidate of their choosing in a primary. … The suit comes after the Executive Committee met Sept. 7 in Columbia and voted to forgo a presidential primary. The move effectively cleared the way for Republican incumbent President Donald Trump to receive all of the state’s nominating delegates without contest.”



THE RULEBOOK: POPULISM 101

“By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 10



TIME OUT: WHAT A BUNCH OF CRETANS

NatGeo: “Deep inside the Labyrinth on the island of Crete lived a Minotaur, a monster half man, half bull. … The story of the Minotaur has thrilled people for thousands of years and inspired myriad works of art: pottery, poetry, plays, the art of Picasso, operas, movies, and video games. Although the myth can be enjoyed as a satisfying tale, archaeologists now know that its fabulous qualities have roots deep in real events in the Bronze Age. The bull-headed man in Minos’s maze embodies several traits found in the culture of Crete and ancient Minoan civilization. Bulls and maze motifs are found throughout Minoan culture, which dominated the Mediterranean from about 3000 B.C. to about 1100 B.C. In confronting and overcoming the bull—a symbol of Crete—Theseus, the legendary founder of Athens, reflects the flowering of Aegean civilizations beginning in the middle of the second millennium B.C., as mainland Greece replaced Crete as the dominant power.”

TRUMP’S TEAM EMBRACES ‘COUP’ CLAIM

Mediaite: “President Donald Trump decried the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry as a ‘coup,’ and it looks like his campaign is embracing that rhetoric to blast Democrats. Trump echoed similar comments made on Fox News in the past few days, including from trade advisor Peter Navarro this week. And now Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted this afternoon Democrats should be working on policies ‘that help America instead of trying to overthrow our government with a coup’ And the Trump campaign has a new ad out today — called ‘Coup’ — accusing Democrats of orchestrating ‘nothing short of a coup’ against the president.”



Senate GOP could take up impeachment only to drop it - NYT: “Senator Mitch McConnell’s comment this week that the Senate would be forced to ‘take up’ articles of impeachment from the House had the capital in a swirl, bracing for a full-blown Senate trial of President Trump. But as things now stand, any trial would likely be swift, ending in dismissal of the accusations. While the focus was on the statement by Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, that the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to begin an impeachment proceeding, it was his next line that might have been more telling: ‘How long you are on it is a whole different matter.’ The fusty rules of the Senate make clear that Republicans could not unilaterally stonewall articles of impeachment of Mr. Trump as they did the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland. But Mr. McConnell’s declaration suggests the Republican-controlled Senate could move expeditiously to toss them out if Republicans conclude the House impeachment is meritless, or a strictly partisan affair.”



Steyer PAC spends big to target Republican senators on impeachment - WaPo: “A group pushing for the impeachment of President Trump is launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting Republican senators over the coming weeks as pro-impeachment activists turn their fire away from Democratic holdouts and toward members of the president’s own party. The group, Need to Impeach, is funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Top executives said Tuesday that more than half of the ad campaign money will go toward television spots, with the rest underwriting digital ads. The campaign will focus on Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), all of whom are seeking reelection next year and could cast votes in the coming months on whether Trump should be removed from office.”



Cheney sends House Republicans home with talking points - WashEx: “Republican leaders in the House of Representatives sent the rank-and-file home with one overriding message to deliver to voters in their districts: There is no evidence that warrants an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The bulleted talking points, prepared by Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, also attack House Democrats as disorganized and the impeachment process as illegitimate, primarily because Nancy Pelosi declined to hold a floor vote on whether to open the inquiry. Cheney argues in her messaging guidance that Democrats have been intent on impeaching Trump for more than two years. An investigation into Trump's harmless telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, she asserts, is just the Democrats' latest excuse to justify their attempt to undo the 2016 election.”



PETE SESSIONS GOES DISTRICT SHOPPING

Texas Tribune: “Former Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions appears poised to make a comeback attempt — but not in his old Dallas-based district. Sessions, who lost reelection last year, plans to announce Thursday he's running for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, according to McLennan County GOP Chairman Jon R. Ker. The announcement will be at the county party headquarters in Waco, added Ker, who said he spoke with Sessions on Tuesday. Sessions' anticipated run is a surprise development after he spent months publicly flirting with running for his previous 32nd District seat, which is about 80 miles north of Flores' more Republican 17th District. The initial reaction ‘has not been positive,’ Flores told The Texas Tribune late Tuesday. ‘Pete is a friend of mine, but I wish he'd called me first,’ said Flores, R-Bryan. ‘I could have provided some valuable feedback to him.’”



Tenney signs up for rematch to reclaim seat - Roll Call: “Former Rep. Claudia Tenney, one of President Donald Trump’s most vocal supporters last Congress, announced Tuesday she will run for her old seat in New York’s 22nd District. Tenney lost by less than 2 percentage points in the 2018 midterms to Democratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi despite running one of the most pro-Trump campaigns of any vulnerable House Republican. The president carried New York’s 22nd District by 15 percentage points in 2016. ‘Upstate New York deserves a representative who will fight for their values in Congress, someone who will work to deliver actual results, not resistance,’ Tenney said in a press release Tuesday.”



Lewandowski shies from Senate run - Politico: “Corey Lewandowski told a local radio host Tuesday ‘it’s fair’ to say he is reconsidering a Senate run in order to defend President Donald Trump from impeachment and help him get reelected. ‘As much as I think I would be a great fighter for the people of New Hampshire, and one U.S. senator can make a difference, it is my priority to make sure the president of United States is reelected,’ Lewandowski said on the radio show, ‘New Hampshire Today with Jack Heath.’ ‘That's a top priority.’ The president's brash and outspoken former campaign manager would have to go up against three other Republicans looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.”



AUDIBLE: POOR GARY

“You don't really want to identify with anybody on that show. The only character with any kind of moral purity to them is Gary, the body guy. But it's not like you really want to be him.” – Mayor Pete Buttigieg when asked which character from HBO’s Veep he relate most to during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Just curious about the railroad spike on the trophy plaque behind you.” – Martin Jarvis, Wright City, Mo.



[Ed. note: Now that’s what I call observant viewership, Mr. Jarvis! Other viewers of our show on Fox Nation may have seen that simple wooden board with a rusty railroad spike behind me. It is from the Monongha Mine in Marion County, W.Va., the scene of the worst mine disaster in American history. On Dec. 6, 1907 at least 362 men were killed when the poorly-ventilated mine filled with methane gas, which exploded with terrible force, killing almost all instantly. Any effort to evacuate the mine would have been badly complicated by a language barrier. The lion’s share of the miners were Italian immigrants, but there would have been Hungarians, Czechs and other non-English speakers working in crews of their own, making it hard for English-speaking foremen to direct an escape as the inferno spread from section to section. The blast collapsed much of the roof and destroyed the rail lines in and out of the mine. That spike came from one of those shattered rail ties and was given long ago to my father, a coal salesman, by a West Virginia coal operator whose own father had saved it after the explosion. I love the way it looks and it goes along with some other ancient mine memorabilia in my office, including a carbide lamp miner’s helmet. But I also love it as a memento of how much I have to be thankful for. My work here in this comfortable, air-conditioned office is safe, well-compensated and personally rewarding. It’s a far cry from the coal pits where so many men toiled and sometimes died. That little spike reminds me of who I am, where I’m from, my dear old dad and, most of all, to be grateful.]

DANA PERINO WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

CBS12: “A man in Fort Lauderdale is accused of tampering with dozens of electric scooters. Authorities have been investigating the vandalism of more than 140 scooters since April. One incident is caught on surveillance video, which police released to the public in an effort to identify a suspect. The investigation led to the arrest of 59-year-old Randall Thomas Williams. Police said they found 20 scooters nearby with severed brake lines. Police say Williams is the one who cut the brake lines on the scooters. He faces criminal mischief charges. Investigators have not revealed a motive. Police are asking anyone who finds an electric scooter that appears to have been tampered with to contact the vendor.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“I had a pet turtle. My brother had a parakeet. Both came to unfortunate ends. My turtle fell behind a radiator and was not discovered until too late. And the parakeet, God bless him, flew out a window once, never to be seen again. After such displays of stewardship, we dared not ask for a dog.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on June 10, 2003.

* The same poll found roughly 39% of registered voters believe Donald Trump deserves a second term, while 57% are ready for a new president.

* Much of the Democrats’ 2020 field participated in an MSNBC policy forum yesterday on addressing gun violence. NBC published a live-blog of the event.

* The lineup and podium order for the next Democratic presidential primary debate was announced yesterday, and it will be a one-night, 12-candidate event.

* With only a month remaining ahead of Louisiana’s gubernatorial race, Trump is urging his followers in the state to support either Eddie Rispone (R) or Ralph Abraham (R), one of whom is likely to advance to a probable runoff against incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D).

* Similarly, with time running out in Mississippi’s gubernatorial race, the president is throwing his support behind Tate Reeves’ (R) candidacy, arguing yesterday that his rival, state Attorney General Jim Hood (D), is “pro-Crooked Hillary.” In case anyone’s curious, the 2016 election was 1,058 days ago."

* As difficult as this may seem to believe, Andrew Yang, a Democratic presidential candidate running for elected office for the first time, raised $10 million in the third quarter. That’s “more than triple the $2.8 million Yang raised in the second quarter.”

* Kamala Harris, meanwhile, raised $11.6 million between July and September, which is awfully close to the $11.8 million she raised in the second quarter.

* Former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), whose 2020 presidential campaign has struggled to gain traction, has reportedly lost four key aides, including his state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire.

* Joe Biden’s campaign released a new plan on gun policy today, which includes an assault-weapons ban. Under the blueprint, those Americans who already own assault weapons would be required to either register the weapons or sell them to the government.

* Speaking of new 2020 plans, Elizabeth Warren’s campaign unveiled a new proposal this morning that would tax lobbying: “Under her proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35% tax on their expenditures. The rate would increase to 60% for spending of more than $1 million, and to 75% above $5 million.”

* And finally, Donald Trump last week told a rather detailed story about CNN building a multi-million-dollar studio in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district, which he said the network intended to keep up “for weeks” if the Democratic candidate won in a recent special election. Like so many of the president’s bizarre anecdotes, the story was completely made up and had no basis in reality."

On Tuesday, leaked audio comments from Zuckerberg said the company would likely sue the U.S. government if Warren became president and attempted to break up the company.

""You have someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,"" Zuckerberg was quoted as saying in two Q&A sessions with Facebook employees during July.

""And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.

BERNIE SANDERS HAS STENTS INSERTED AFTER DOCTORS FIND BLOCKAGE

Sanders took a break from the trail this week after he ended up in the hospital with heart complications and underwent an emergency procedure Tuesday to repair a blocked artery, according to his campaign.

""We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,"" Sanders' campaign said in a statement.

Varney argued that Sanders' hospital visit lends credence to those questioning whether his age will get in the way of securing a spot in the Oval Office.

""There are now obvious questions about whether a 78-year-old can endure months of exhausting campaigning,"" he said.

Varney then turned to Biden, who has come under fire since the launch of a formal impeachment investigation against President Trump over the content of a phone call during which Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Biden and son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

""He is a casualty of the impeachment, he is collateral damage,"" said Varney. ""All the attention given to the Ukraine call has brought back the question about Hunter Biden, and the money he received in Ukraine and China.""

""It all happened so quickly,"" he continued, ""but as of now, it's Elizabeth Warren's nomination to lose.""

However, Varney said he didn't think Warren could win the general election in November 2020 ""for two reasons.""

""I don't think Americans will elect as president someone who wants to destroy our economic system,"" he said. ""Elizabeth Warren is a socialist. Her proposals would destroy capitalism, and with it, the prosperity we enjoy today.""

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Varney said the second reason was due to Warren's ""demeanor,""

""Anger is Senator Warren's frequent theme, hating capitalism, the rich, the billionaires, Wall Street -- that plays well to socialists, but on your screens, every day for four years, anger is not so attractive,"" he said. ""... You've got to be good on TV to win these days.""

Varney also issued a warning to Democrats, saying they should be ""very worried,"" should ""far-left"" Warren win the nomination.

Warren spoke to a much larger and friendlier crowd in Carson City on Wednesday evening – but a Trump supporter holding a “Keep America Great” sign interrupted her speech, prompting the crowd of Warren backers to chant ""Lock him up!”

""There's a lot we need to do,” Warren said to the crowd, according to New York Times reporter Thomas Kaplan, who tweeted the video. “And I understand, I understand that Donald Trump and his supporters are getting really nervous, and they have a good reason to be.""

Support for Warren has surged among Democrats in recent weeks, with the candidate passing former Vice President Joe Biden by four points in a new national poll released this week.

Warren spoke earlier Wednesday at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas.

Biden was also in Nevada on Wednesday, making a campaign stop in Reno, where he attacked Trump for his alleged “abuse of power.”

""Should Donald Trump be banned from Twitter?"" a reporter asked. Warren laughed and said simply, ""No.""

The comment came after Harris sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Tuesday, accusing the president of violating the company's terms of service. ""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing,"" she said.

She specifically pointed to tweets in which the president attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and suggested there would be ""big consequences"" for the whistleblower who reported on his call with Ukraine.

Harris also flagged a tweet in which Trump accused Democrats of engaging in a ""coup."" ""Hey @jack. Time to do something about this,"" Harris tweeted, using the Twitter CEO's handle.

That prompted a clash among media figures as Five Thirty-Eight founder Nate Silver pushed back on removing Trump from his favored platform.

“Twitter is endangering the world and breaking its own terms of service to do it. Trump or Jack must go,” Resistance San Francisco said at the beginning of 2018.

In a blog post around that time, Twitter put the kibosh on banning world leaders from the platform. ""Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation.

""Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate. It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions."""

And Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered a simple ""no"" when asked by reporters if she thought the Republican president should be booted from Twitter. The Massachusetts Democrat chuckled as she gave her one-word answer on Wednesday.

Harris called this week for the president’s Twitter account to be shut down. This followed a storm of tweets by Trump critical of the whistleblower who filed a complaint against him over the Ukraine controversy. That controversy has spurred a House impeachment inquiry.

Trump, in a tweet, also questioned whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff should be arrested for “treason.” And on Wednesday he called the House Democrats' investigation “BULLS---"" in one tweet and a ""COUP"" in another.

“The words of a president matter. Trump has again shown he is irresponsible and endangering others with his tweets. He should lose the privilege to be on Twitter,” Harris wrote on Twitter on Monday.

She urged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to take action.

Gabbard's comments weren't the first time she's disagreed with Harris.

The two candidates clashed in a viral moment at July’s Democratic primary debate, when Gabbard took aim at the former California attorney general over her record as a prosecutor.

While the Biden campaign is already running digital ads across the country and has spent six figures to run TV commercials in Iowa, this is its first major multi-state ad buy.

Yujing Zhang, 33, who is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 22, was caught by Secret Service agents with troves of technology embedded with malware and thousands of dollars in cash after she claimed that she was at Trump's prestigious club to attend a “United Nations friendship event” that had apparently been canceled. Her bizarre behavior and backstory led to suspicions that she was a Chinese government spy, but she was not charged with espionage or related crimes.

CHINESE WOMAN FOUND GUILTY OF TRESPASSING AT MAR-A-LAGO

Zhang apparently purchased a $20,000 travel package from Li Weitian, also known as Charles Lee, who advertised tickets on the Chinese social media site WeChat promising access to events across the U.S. to meet prominent political and business figures.

Lee ran the United Nations Chinese Friendship Association, which is not affiliated with the U.N., and was photographed at least twice with Cindy Yang, a Republican donor and former Florida massage parlor owner who organized events at Mar-a-Lago.

Upon learning that the event at Mar-a-Lago had been canceled, Lee tried to convince Zhang to attend another event on Wall Street in New York City, text messages between the pair released by the South Florida court Thursday revealed. Bill and HIllary Clinton were scheduled to be there.

""Regarding the event at the Trump's estate, it's been put on hold for now. We can forget about it. We have two other activities now. I sent them to you already,"" Lee texted Zhang on March 26, four days before she was arrested on the Trump property.

At the time of her arrest, Zhang told federal agents that she did not know that the event had been canceled, a claim contradicted by her messages.

Lee urged Zhang to go to ""Clinton's event, Clinton and his wife Hillary,"" he said, offering her a ticket for $60,000. ""There are politicians and the finance people that you talked about wanting to meet in this event. You can meet with these two famous people in one setting. Hillary was the former Secretary of State, equivalent to the Prime Minister. That is very extraordinary. Er... you can stand in between them and have a photo taken.""

In the same message, Lee also says, ""You can also go to Buffett's event which is particularly for investment and finance,"" referring to business mogul Warren Buffett.

Lee also explained to her why the previously scheduled Trump event was allegedly canceled.

""Regarding the Trump's event, this is what happened. It's because the Democratic Party has all along been fighting with the Republican Party. He is from the Republican Party. They accused Trump of colluding with Russia. Recently the investigation said Trump did not. He's not guilty. The media is controlled by the Republic Party-- eh, the Democratic Party. That's why they are in trouble. Trump takes the revenge. So they now join together and attack Trump. ... In order to minimize the nonsense, they canceled his events for the time being.""

In subsequent messages, Zhang asked Lee for her money back after hearing of the cancellation but ended up traveling from Shanghai to Florida anyway. Her motives for going to the property and lying to Secret Service agents at Mar-a-Lago remain unclear."

“Not a day goes by that we don't get a call from somebody wanting us to attend a function or two or trying to become involved in our [community],” said Melendez.

The strategy could pay off. While the Native American population in the country remains relatively small, at about 1.5 percent of the general population, they make up a sizable portion of eligible voters in several states or districts, according to data from the National Congress of American Indians, or NCAI. The numbers continue to grow.

ELIZABETH WARREN REVISITS DNA TEST APOLOGIZES TO NATIVE AMERICANS

“[The population] has grown 27 percent since the year 2000. We're a younger crowd that is getting more visible, more educated, more active,” said Kevin Allis, CEO of NCAI.

As more Native Americans gain access to the polls, the voting bloc, which has previously complained about being overlooked, could be pivotal in key primary states like Iowa, Arizona, and Nevada. The latter two states have relatively large Native populations (Nevada has 27 federally recognized tribes) that could make a significant difference.

During the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., reportedly earned 83.3 percent of the Indian Settlement precinct votes after visiting the Meskwaki settlement. He has credited those votes for helping him almost beat U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: WE NEED AN ECONOMY AND GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL, NOT JUST THE 1 PERCENT

“From top to bottom, in all the different elections, you can see where the margins are that thin. We really have an opportunity to make a difference,” Allis said.

To improve turnout, many Native American voting activists have called for better access to the polls. They say the issue is most pressing in rural areas where some tribal lands may be more than a hundred miles away from a polling location.

“I think Native Americans sometimes are reluctant to go to try to find where the voting site is in the city. But if we can bring those voting sites out to reservation lands, I think we'll have a better turnout,” said Melendez.

Some of the main issues for Indian country include climate change and addressing the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. But, above all, they’ve called for the federal government to honor the agreements laid out in treaties with Native American nations.

“Native Americans have given up millions of acres of land in exchange for those promises of health care, of law enforcement, all those different governmental needs that we have,” said Melendez.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have rolled out policy proposals targeting Native Americans. They touched on some of those plans in August during the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, which was organized by the non-profit organization, Four Directions Inc., and considered the first forum in history to exclusively cover Native American issues.

There, Warren apologized for her highly criticized use of a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry. Her proposal was largely seen as an attempt to soften the blowback from the controversy, which angered many Native Americans and continues to haunt her campaign.

Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their dealings in Ukraine. A whistleblower, along with Democrats, argue Trump in essence was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly described his phone call with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

At the same time, the president has sought to turn the tables on Biden by highlighting allegations against the former vice president and his son that he wanted investigated.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed. Trump’s re-election campaign last week launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his alleged actions.

The Monmouth poll indicates that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure.

Among crucial self-identified independent voters, 39 percent believe that Biden pressured Ukrainian officials, with 27 percent disagreeing and a third unsure.

“The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

Biden's allies maintain he intervened in Ukraine over corruption concerns, not because of his son's work.

And Biden once again emphasized on Wednesday that ""there’s zero, zero evidence, of any assertion made.""

The survey also spells trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be re-elected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

“Trump’s base is sticking with him, but these results suggest that the president remains particularly weak among voting blocs that were crucial to putting him over the top in 2016,” Murray said.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The survey is also the latest to indicate the race for the Democratic nomination is turning into a two-candidate battle between Biden and progressive champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Warren stands at 28 percent support among self-identified Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, with the former vice president at 25 percent. Warren’s advantage is within the survey’s sampling error.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run, stands at 15 percent. Biden, Sanders and Warren were all tied in Monmouth’s previous poll, conducted in August.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 5 percent in the survey, along with Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Tech-entrepreneur Andrew Yang and best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson are at 2 percent in the poll, with 11 other contenders in the record-setting Democratic field registering at 1 percent or less.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Sept. 23-29, with 1,161 people questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

Biden’s haul is a drop of more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June second quarter of fundraising, and is far behind the $25.3 million that nomination rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont brought in the past three months. It’s also less than the $19.1 million that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised in the third quarter.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

Highlighting the numbers, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz noted that “today’s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall. The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond. Our campaign unequivocally does, and builds on our strength each week.”

The Biden camp emphasized that 98 percent of all donations were from grassroots donors giving $200 or less, and that 56 percent of contributors in the past three months were new to the campaign.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

Among those yet to report third-quarter fundraising figures is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is tied with Biden for the lead position in most the recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

President Trump’s reelection team announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to officially file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. The third-quarter fundraising figures of the Democratic presidential candidates will be heavily analyzed and scrutinized. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel, and ads."

Moore, a senior economics analyst at the Heritage Foundation, highlighted on “Fox & Friends” a new study that shows median incomes in the middle-class are rising much faster than they did under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

SANDERS UPS ANTE WITH HIGHER WEALTH TAX PROPOSAL THAN WARREN’S: ‘BILLIONAIRES SHOULD NOT EXIST’

Moore, who helped write the 2017 tax cuts, cited a report from the Census Bureau and said: “Since Donald Trump was elected and took office through July of 2019, median family incomes, middle-class incomes are up $4,100.”

""In the entire eight years that Obama was president, incomes only budged up about $1,000, so in one-third of the time, Trump has increased income by four times as much. We now have a median income of 65,000 dollars. That shows pretty clearly that the middle-class has been benefiting,” he added.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.

The release of the independent senator from Vermont's ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.

Moore argued that Democrats are going to have a hard time proving to Americans that their economic policies will be better.

“If these numbers hold up, it’s going to be difficult for any Democrat to beat Donald Trump because he’s proven to be the blue-collar president,” Moore said.

He acknowledged, however, that there was a poor report Tuesday on U.S. manufacturing and exports.

The ISM September Manufacturing Index slipped to 47.8, down 1.3 percentage points from August. A read below 50 signals contraction. More worrisome is new export orders, which hit 41 percent, a 2.3 percentage point drop from last month.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Wednesday announced the lineup for their Oct. 15 fourth-round presidential primary debate, and as expected, 12 candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria.

That means the showdown will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order – former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – with lower qualifying thresholds – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. The thresholds were raised for the third-round debate, resulting in 10 candidates facing off on one night.

The DNC announced last week that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by Tuesday’s deadline.

Christopher P. Hasson, 50, admitted to all four charges against him -- illegally possessing unregistered silencers, illegally possessing unserialized silencers, possession of a firearm by an unlawful user or addict of a controlled substance and illegal possession of a controlled substance -- in federal court in Greenbelt, Md.

He was not charged with any terror-related crimes.

The Coast Guard lieutenant was arrested in February in his Silver Spring, Md., home, where authorities said they found a stockpile of weapons, including 15 guns, smoke grenades, silencers and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, the opioid painkiller Tramadol and other items.

Federal prosecutors allege Hasson compiled a spreadsheet of names he planned to target and claimed the self-described white nationalist was hell-bent on the ""murder [of] innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.""

COAST GUARD OFFICER ORDERED TO JAIL, ACCUSED OF BEING 'DOMESTIC TERRORIST'

After Thursday's hearing, Hasson's public defender said the case had been “mischaracterized and sensationalized.”

Liz Oyer said Hasson “was not plotting a terrorist attack or any of the abhorrent acts that the prosecution has repeatedly speculated about but never actually charged.”

Some of the prominent figures whose names were listed on Hasson's spreadsheet included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; and Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.

Several cable TV personalities, including MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN's Chris Cuomo and Van Jones were also mentioned.

Investigators said Hasson searched for Scarborough’s home address in January and Googled “best place in dc to see congress people” and “civil war if trump impeached,"" according to The Washington Post.

Prosecutors said he also targeted two unidentified Supreme Court justices and two social media executives and also searched for their home addresses online.

Investigators said Hasson appeared to be inspired by Anders Behring Breivik, a Norwegian right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in a 2011 bomb attack and shooting rampage.

His lawyers filed a request last week to bar prosecutors from introducing evidence linking him to white supremacist views or associations. In 2017, Hasson wrote to a Nazi leader where he advocated for ""'focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland,"" according to prosecutors.

Hasson, who had served in the Marines, worked at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington as an acquisition officer to acquire advanced new cutters for the agency. He faces up to 31 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 31.

Medicare itself remains popular, but the calls to enact a single-payer, government-run system for everyone are far more controversial. Signing the order at the Villages – a retirement community north of Orlando – Trump singled out Democrats he said want to “totally obliterate Medicare.”

“They want to raid Medicare to fund the idea of socialism,” Trump said. “All of the Democrats' plans would totally devastate our health care plans.”

Trump added, “Democratic health care proposals would put everyone into a single-payer, socialist government-run plan.”

‘MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SPONSOR SAYS PLAN WOULD GUT 1 MILLION PRIVATE INSURANCE JOBS

The president’s criticism of the Democrats' plan was squarely aimed at the Medicare-for-all proposals of candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Sanders’ “single-payer” approach would cover people of any age and would incorporate the Medicare program. Private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option used by about one-third of seniors, would no longer have a role.

Medicare Advantage, the private insurance option under Medicare, offers savings on premiums and an annual limit on out-of-pocket costs. They provide one-stop shopping, eliminating the need for separate supplemental insurance. Offered by major insurers, the plans also cover prescription drugs in most cases.

But there are trade-offs. Seniors joining a Medicare Advantage plan generally must accept limits on their choice of hospitals and doctors as well as prior insurer approval for certain procedures. If they change their minds and decide to return to traditional Medicare, they’re not always guaranteed supplemental “Medigap” coverage, which is also private.

Trump’s order directs his department to examine whether its current policies and practices put traditional Medicare ahead of the private Medicare Advantage option.

The order would seek to expand the range of additional services that can be offered by the private plans and would direct regulators to find more ways for seniors to financially benefit from plans that provide cost-efficient service.

FELLOW 2020 CANDIDATE CALLS BERNIE'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN A 'LOSING BATTLE' THAT WILL SET COUNTRY BACK 10 YEARS

Many Medicare Advantage insurers offer some dental and vision coverage, along with basics like transportation to medical appointments. But the industry lately has started to experiment with in-home assistance, including nutritious meals and financial help with safety-related home improvements.

Sanders, who underwent a heart procedure this week, has argued that Medicare-for-all would offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs. In a tweet on Wednesday, Sanders reiterated the support for his proposal and added that “no one should fear going bankrupt” because of a hospital trip.

""None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!""

Trump also took time during his speech to slam Democrats for opening an impeachment inquiry over a phone call the president had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. In it, he asked Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s family’s dealings in the country.

“It’s corruption going on right now,” Trump said, calling congressional leaders “Do Nothing Dems” and the inquiry ""a hoax.""

Leonard and his wife, Amanda, have property at Baker's Bay just east of Great Abaco in the Bahamas, and she was on a text chain with a woman who lives in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, and had a home near Baker's Bay. The woman, Beth Warren, was hosting families and sharing tales of the devastation and the needs.

The answer was a collaboration with player and analyst Brad Faxon and Seth Waugh, the retired Deutsche Bank Americas CEO and now president of the PGA of America. That resulted in the ""Bahamas Strong Pro-Am"" to be held Oct. 8 at Old Marsh Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

Registration is closed because the pro-am of 22 groups already sold out. Donations are still being sought through the website and all proceeds go directly to relief efforts.

The field has some star power — Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Ernie Els and Justin Thomas are among 19 players already enlisted.

Leonard said his only experience with such events was a charity spin class that raised $100,000 annually for a camp for children coping with cancer. He at least knew the right people to call. It started with PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, mainly to get contact information for Waugh. And then he got Faxon involved to help find a golf course and players.

""Fax opened up his Rolodex, which is way more extensive than mine, and we started sending texts and emails,"" Leonard said.

They had to move quickly, especially with the PGA Tour and LPGA Tour heading for Asia. The only logical date was Oct. 8, which gave them a month to get to work. Thomas, who vacations at Baker's Bay, was among the first to sign up. Nicklaus, Norman and Els added Hall of Fame cachet.

Others include Jessica Korda, Marina Alex, Leta Lindley and Jaye Greene from the LPGA Tour, Lucas Glover, Billy Horschel, Corey Conners, Charl Schwartzel, Rory Sabbatini, Brett Quigley, Jesper Parnevik, Leonard and Faxon. The latest to sign up was Joaquin Niemann of Chile.

""There's so much they need before they can even think about rebuilding,"" Warren told Golf Digest. ""There is a lot of need and a lot of confusion down there.""

END OF THE ROAD

The LPGA Tour is in Texas this week, and it could be the end of the season some two months before the season actually ends.

The Volunteers of America Classic north of Dallas is the final full-field event of the year before the LPGA Tour heads to Asia for four weeks and then concludes at the CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida, the week before Thanksgiving.

At stake for some, like Cristie Kerr, is a chance to reach the Tour Championship. For others, like Paula Creamer and Gerina Piller, it's a matter of making sure they have full LPGA Tour cards for next year. Creamer is No. 89 while Piller is No. 91. Both were on the U.S. Solheim Cup team two years ago.

The top 100 on the Race to the CME Globe keep their full cards, but this could be the last week to earn points. The four Asian events — China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan — have sponsor exemptions, but any LPGA Tour member who gets into the tournament through an exemption is not eligible to earn Race to CME Globe points.

The field for three Asia events is for the top 62 on the LPGA points list, with only 43 spots in Japan. Not everyone plays. Lexi Thompson, for example, plans to play only the Toto Japan Classic, so the availability dips down beyond No. 62.

For some players, it's a matter of how far. Kerr is at No. 69. She currently is the third alternate for the Buick LPGA Shanghai and the fifth alternate for the Taiwan Swinging Skirts LPGA.

Jennifer Kupcho, who deferred her membership until June so she could finish at Wake Forest, is at No. 59.

All but four players — Haru Nomura, Mel Reid, Mariajo Uribe and Alison Lee — from No. 61 through No. 100 is in the field in the Volunteers of America Classic.

MUIRFIELD MODIFICATIONS

Jack Nicklaus isn't done tinkering with his Muirfield Village, though he calls the next improvements ""my last bite at the apple.""

The home of the Memorial announced a two-phase project that Nicklaus will oversee for the next two years. When all the work is finished, the par-5 fifth hole will play as par 4 for the Memorial, making par 71 for the first time.

The work starts this fall with three new tees for the par-3 eighth and both par 5s on the back nine, Nos. 11 and 15. The course will tip out at 7,462 yards — it was at 6,978 yards when the Memorial was first played in 1974.

The work is expected to be ready for the PGA Tour event the first week in June, with Patrick Cantlay the defending champion.

Then, the course will close a month after the Memorial to rebuild all 18 greens, including new sub-surface heating and cooling. Bunkers will be rebuilt, tees levels and the irrigation system updated. Nicklaus said fairways will be grassed, but the widths will remain generous.

Nicklaus said the par-5 fifth hole will be redesigned after next year's tournament to create a larger landing area off the tee. He is hopeful it will allow more players to hit driver off the tee and then have a mid-iron over the water onto the green.

""I've done little tweaks on the golf course throughout the years, and some significant changes, like the par-3 16th,"" Nicklaus said. ""This time, we are going through the golf course, A to Z, and making sure we do everything at one time.""

Nicklaus said he will add more forward tees for the members at Muirfield Village.

""But my belief is that tournament golf should be a test to find out who is the best golfer that week,"" he said. ""Far too many tournaments have eliminated the rough and firmness of greens, and that is just not my idea of what the game of golf should be.""

SANDERS OFF THE TRAIL WITH HEART PROBLEMS

AP: “Bernie Sanders’ campaign says the Democratic presidential candidate has had a heart procedure for a blocked artery. The Vermont senator is canceling events and appearances ‘until further notice.’ The campaign says the 78-year-old Sanders experienced chest discomfort during an event Tuesday and sought medical evaluation. The campaign says two stents were ‘successfully inserted’ and that Sanders ‘is conversing and in good spirits.’ His campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, was on a telephone call with supporters Tuesday night but didn’t mention any health concerns about the candidate. Shakir said the ‘state of the campaign is strong’ and he played up Sanders’ strong fundraising total for the third quarter. Sanders recently canceled some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. The campaign said at the time he felt fine.”



Biden still strong in South Carolina - Greenville [S.C.] News: “The latest Winthrop Poll results are out and South Carolina democratic voters strongly support former Vice President Joe Biden for the presidency, according to the results. Biden drew 37% of the votes among those surveyed. Among African American democrats and democratic-leaning African Americans, Biden earned 46% of the votes, according to the poll. This is the first Winthrop Poll looking at the 2020 primary candidates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren earned 17%, Sen. Bernie Sanders 8%, Sen. Kamala Harris 7% and the remaining 15 candidates each earned less than 5% support in the poll. … The Winthrop Poll is among the list of qualifying polls [for debate qualifications]. Of the remaining 15 candidates, only South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker earned at least 3% approval.”



Warren, Biden neck in neck in New Hampshire - WMUR: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now in a virtual dead heat with former Vice President Joe Biden in the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary campaign, according to a new poll. The latest Saint Anselm College Center Survey Center poll shows that Warren’s overall upward trajectory is evident in New Hampshire, as it has been recently in national polls. … Sen. Bernie Sanders, the landslide winner of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, is in third place with 11 percent, essentially tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was backed by 10 percent of those polled. … Sen. Kamala Harris was the top choice of 5 percent, while U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Amy Klobuchar received 3 percent each. Philanthropist/activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang each received support from 2 percent of those polled, while Sen. Cory Booker was backed by 1 percent.”



Yang brings in big bucks with free money plan - Axios: “2020 candidate Andrew Yang's campaign says it raised $10 million in 2019's third quarter, according to Politico. Why it matters: Yang's Q3 report is more than triple the $2.8 million he raised in the second quarter — a push powered by some strong debate performances that elevated his national profile. The state of play: Yang outpaced Sen. Cory Booker’s $6 million and came close to Sen. Kamala Harris’ $11.6 million. … Yang's campaign said nearly 300,000 people have donated — almost double the threshold required to qualify for the November debate. … Yang's campaign told Politico that it received $1 million in the 72 hours after the September debate in which he announced that he was giving away $120,000 to 10 families over a year to promote signature campaign proposal: universal basic income, branded by Yang as the ‘freedom dividend.’”



HUGE CASH HAUL FOR TRUMP

AP: “President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter of the year, a presidential fundraising record. The pro-Trump effort said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank. Republicans aim to use the fundraising haul to fight off Democrats’ impeachment effort. Former President Barack Obama and the DNC raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011. ‘President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,’ said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers.”



GOP moves to stifle dissent in Charlotte - NYT: “President Trump’s political advisers have concluded a monthslong effort to tighten the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, all but ensuring there are no dissenting speeches at the gathering of party officials in Charlotte next year. On Tuesday, state Republican parties submitted to the national committee their delegate allocation plans, the methods by which they will choose and bind delegates who attend the convention as their representatives. In 37 states and territories, there have been changes to the rules that will all but stamp out the possibility of any raucous divide on the convention floor. … The new delegate guidelines are the culmination of a 10-month effort by Trump advisers to strengthen the president’s grip on the Republican Party ahead of the general election. It means that even if the three candidates challenging Mr. Trump in the Republican primary gain vote shares, they almost certainly won’t translate into speeches or jeers from supporters of these candidates when the convention is taking place.”



South Carolina Republicans sue over nixed primary - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Two Republicans, one of them former congressman Bob Inglis, have sued the S.C. Republican Party over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state court in Richland County, alleges the party scrapped its 2020 election contest illegally and violated party rules and state election law. The suit further contends the near-unanimous decision made by the party’s Executive Committee deprives Inglis, of Greenville, and fellow plaintiff Frank Heindel of Mount Pleasant, of their right to vote for the candidate of their choosing in a primary. … The suit comes after the Executive Committee met Sept. 7 in Columbia and voted to forgo a presidential primary. The move effectively cleared the way for Republican incumbent President Donald Trump to receive all of the state’s nominating delegates without contest.”



THE RULEBOOK: POPULISM 101

“By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 10



TIME OUT: WHAT A BUNCH OF CRETANS

NatGeo: “Deep inside the Labyrinth on the island of Crete lived a Minotaur, a monster half man, half bull. … The story of the Minotaur has thrilled people for thousands of years and inspired myriad works of art: pottery, poetry, plays, the art of Picasso, operas, movies, and video games. Although the myth can be enjoyed as a satisfying tale, archaeologists now know that its fabulous qualities have roots deep in real events in the Bronze Age. The bull-headed man in Minos’s maze embodies several traits found in the culture of Crete and ancient Minoan civilization. Bulls and maze motifs are found throughout Minoan culture, which dominated the Mediterranean from about 3000 B.C. to about 1100 B.C. In confronting and overcoming the bull—a symbol of Crete—Theseus, the legendary founder of Athens, reflects the flowering of Aegean civilizations beginning in the middle of the second millennium B.C., as mainland Greece replaced Crete as the dominant power.”

TRUMP’S TEAM EMBRACES ‘COUP’ CLAIM

Mediaite: “President Donald Trump decried the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry as a ‘coup,’ and it looks like his campaign is embracing that rhetoric to blast Democrats. Trump echoed similar comments made on Fox News in the past few days, including from trade advisor Peter Navarro this week. And now Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted this afternoon Democrats should be working on policies ‘that help America instead of trying to overthrow our government with a coup’ And the Trump campaign has a new ad out today — called ‘Coup’ — accusing Democrats of orchestrating ‘nothing short of a coup’ against the president.”



Senate GOP could take up impeachment only to drop it - NYT: “Senator Mitch McConnell’s comment this week that the Senate would be forced to ‘take up’ articles of impeachment from the House had the capital in a swirl, bracing for a full-blown Senate trial of President Trump. But as things now stand, any trial would likely be swift, ending in dismissal of the accusations. While the focus was on the statement by Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, that the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to begin an impeachment proceeding, it was his next line that might have been more telling: ‘How long you are on it is a whole different matter.’ The fusty rules of the Senate make clear that Republicans could not unilaterally stonewall articles of impeachment of Mr. Trump as they did the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland. But Mr. McConnell’s declaration suggests the Republican-controlled Senate could move expeditiously to toss them out if Republicans conclude the House impeachment is meritless, or a strictly partisan affair.”



Steyer PAC spends big to target Republican senators on impeachment - WaPo: “A group pushing for the impeachment of President Trump is launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting Republican senators over the coming weeks as pro-impeachment activists turn their fire away from Democratic holdouts and toward members of the president’s own party. The group, Need to Impeach, is funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Top executives said Tuesday that more than half of the ad campaign money will go toward television spots, with the rest underwriting digital ads. The campaign will focus on Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), all of whom are seeking reelection next year and could cast votes in the coming months on whether Trump should be removed from office.”



Cheney sends House Republicans home with talking points - WashEx: “Republican leaders in the House of Representatives sent the rank-and-file home with one overriding message to deliver to voters in their districts: There is no evidence that warrants an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The bulleted talking points, prepared by Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, also attack House Democrats as disorganized and the impeachment process as illegitimate, primarily because Nancy Pelosi declined to hold a floor vote on whether to open the inquiry. Cheney argues in her messaging guidance that Democrats have been intent on impeaching Trump for more than two years. An investigation into Trump's harmless telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, she asserts, is just the Democrats' latest excuse to justify their attempt to undo the 2016 election.”



PETE SESSIONS GOES DISTRICT SHOPPING

Texas Tribune: “Former Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions appears poised to make a comeback attempt — but not in his old Dallas-based district. Sessions, who lost reelection last year, plans to announce Thursday he's running for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, according to McLennan County GOP Chairman Jon R. Ker. The announcement will be at the county party headquarters in Waco, added Ker, who said he spoke with Sessions on Tuesday. Sessions' anticipated run is a surprise development after he spent months publicly flirting with running for his previous 32nd District seat, which is about 80 miles north of Flores' more Republican 17th District. The initial reaction ‘has not been positive,’ Flores told The Texas Tribune late Tuesday. ‘Pete is a friend of mine, but I wish he'd called me first,’ said Flores, R-Bryan. ‘I could have provided some valuable feedback to him.’”



Tenney signs up for rematch to reclaim seat - Roll Call: “Former Rep. Claudia Tenney, one of President Donald Trump’s most vocal supporters last Congress, announced Tuesday she will run for her old seat in New York’s 22nd District. Tenney lost by less than 2 percentage points in the 2018 midterms to Democratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi despite running one of the most pro-Trump campaigns of any vulnerable House Republican. The president carried New York’s 22nd District by 15 percentage points in 2016. ‘Upstate New York deserves a representative who will fight for their values in Congress, someone who will work to deliver actual results, not resistance,’ Tenney said in a press release Tuesday.”



Lewandowski shies from Senate run - Politico: “Corey Lewandowski told a local radio host Tuesday ‘it’s fair’ to say he is reconsidering a Senate run in order to defend President Donald Trump from impeachment and help him get reelected. ‘As much as I think I would be a great fighter for the people of New Hampshire, and one U.S. senator can make a difference, it is my priority to make sure the president of United States is reelected,’ Lewandowski said on the radio show, ‘New Hampshire Today with Jack Heath.’ ‘That's a top priority.’ The president's brash and outspoken former campaign manager would have to go up against three other Republicans looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Just curious about the railroad spike on the trophy plaque behind you.” – Martin Jarvis, Wright City, Mo.



[Ed. note: Now that’s what I call observant viewership, Mr. Jarvis! Other viewers of our show on Fox Nation may have seen that simple wooden board with a rusty railroad spike behind me. It is from the Monongha Mine in Marion County, W.Va., the scene of the worst mine disaster in American history. On Dec. 6, 1907 at least 362 men were killed when the poorly-ventilated mine filled with methane gas, which exploded with terrible force, killing almost all instantly. Any effort to evacuate the mine would have been badly complicated by a language barrier. The lion’s share of the miners were Italian immigrants, but there would have been Hungarians, Czechs and other non-English speakers working in crews of their own, making it hard for English-speaking foremen to direct an escape as the inferno spread from section to section. The blast collapsed much of the roof and destroyed the rail lines in and out of the mine. That spike came from one of those shattered rail ties and was given long ago to my father, a coal salesman, by a West Virginia coal operator whose own father had saved it after the explosion. I love the way it looks and it goes along with some other ancient mine memorabilia in my office, including a carbide lamp miner’s helmet. But I also love it as a memento of how much I have to be thankful for. My work here in this comfortable, air-conditioned office is safe, well-compensated and personally rewarding. It’s a far cry from the coal pits where so many men toiled and sometimes died. That little spike reminds me of who I am, where I’m from, my dear old dad and, most of all, to be grateful.]

CBS12: “A man in Fort Lauderdale is accused of tampering with dozens of electric scooters. Authorities have been investigating the vandalism of more than 140 scooters since April. One incident is caught on surveillance video, which police released to the public in an effort to identify a suspect. The investigation led to the arrest of 59-year-old Randall Thomas Williams. Police said they found 20 scooters nearby with severed brake lines. Police say Williams is the one who cut the brake lines on the scooters. He faces criminal mischief charges. Investigators have not revealed a motive. Police are asking anyone who finds an electric scooter that appears to have been tampered with to contact the vendor.”

The admission puts the mayor on a long line of corrupt leadership in the city, which has been riddled with chronic budget problems.

Frank Gillam Jr. told the judge he stole funds raised from donors in Atlantic City and Philadelphia for the Atlantic City Starz for personal expenses between 2013 and 2018. He was elected mayor in 2017 after serving as a City Councilman.

He was released after posting a $100,000 bond with the court, but New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and other elected officials quickly called for him to resign. Plans were already being made for the City Council president to assume Gillam’s position.

Gillam, 49, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted in his trial, which is set for Jan. 7. Half of the money he stole was recovered from his home when FBI agents raided it in December, and he’s agreed to pay restitution for the fraud.

JUDGE HUGS AMBER GUYGER, GIVES HER A BIBLE AFTER MURDER CONVICTION, CAUSING A STIR

According to prosecutors, Gillam used the money for personal expenses such as luxury clothing, expensive meals and trips. He had solicited the donations using his political office under the false pretense they were for the youth basketball team or for school supplies for underprivileged children.

“When a scheme depletes (a) charity for children, it's unconscionable,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregory Ehrie. “But when the fraud is perpetrated by someone the public trusts, it damages the community's confidence in their public servants. This defendant betrayed the trust of his community and of people who wanted to improve the lives of children.”

WARREN, GABBARD KNOCK HARRIS' BID TO BAN TRUMP FROM TWITTER

Gillam’s lawyer, Harry Rimm, issued a defense that Gillam only admitted misusing private funds, not public money, which he argued made the mayor better than many of his predecessors. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy when Gillam took office in 2017 as its casino industry struggled.

The Atlantic City mayoral office has a long history of rampant corruption, lending ground for the 1920s-era hit HBO series ""Boardwalk Empire.""

As of 2007, four of the city's last eight mayors had been arrested on corruption charges and one-third of the nine-member City Council was either in prison or under house arrest.

Robert Levey, mayor of the city from 2006-2007, admitted in court to falsifying his military record to receive $25,000 worth of benefits. In 1991, former mayor James Usry admitted to a campaign finance violation of accepting $6,000 in exchange for supporting an ordinance that would benefit the company that offered the money.

In a drafted letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg obtained by Fox News, Barr says the tech giant should not proceed with its plan unless it can ensure that ""there is no reduction to user safety"" and also include ""a means for lawful access to the content of communications"" to protect the public.

""We must find a way to balance the need to secure data with public safety and the need for law enforcement to access the information they need to safeguard the public, investigate crimes and prevent future criminal activity,"" the letter states. ""Not doing so hinders our law enforcement agencies' ability to stop criminals and abusers in their tracks.""

Facebook, which owns the end-to-end encrypted messaging service WhatsApp, is planning to offer the same type of encryption for Facebook Messenger and Instagram as part of its push to integrate the messaging services.

WARREN USES ZUCKERBERG AUDIO IN INSTAGRAM VIDEO, SAYS THE 'RICH AND POWERFUL' FEAR HER

The letter echoes Barr's comments in July at a cybersecurity conference.

“Converting the internet and communications platforms into a law-free zone, and thus giving criminals the means to operate free of lawful scrutiny will inevitably propel an expansion of criminal activity,” he said at the event. ""If you remove any possibility that the cops are going to be watching a neighborhood, the criminals already in the neighborhood will commit a lot more crimes.""

The letter -- which is also signed by Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton -- points out that Facebook does a lot to crack down on illegal content.

In 2018, the social network made 16.8 million reports to the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, an organization it has worked with for years. In addition, more than 99 percent of content the tech giant takes action against is identified by machine learning and algorithms, rather than reports from actual users.

FACEBOOK FACT-CHECKING TO EXEMPT OPINION AND SATIRE

""We believe people have the right to have a private conversation online, wherever they are in the world. As the U.S. and U.K. governments acknowledge, the CLOUD Act allows for companies to provide available information when they receive valid legal requests and does not require companies to build back doors,"" a Facebook spokesperson told Fox News via email on Thursday.

The company spokesperson said the tech giant is consulting with child safety experts, governments and tech companies ahead of its plan to bring more security to its messaging apps.

""End-to-end encryption already protects the messages of over a billion people every day. It is increasingly used across the communications industry and in many other important sectors of the economy,"" the Facebook spokesperson said. ""We strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.”

The Boeing B-17 carrying 10 passengers and three crew members slammed into a maintenance building at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn., after the pilot reported a problem and attempted to land shortly before 10 a.m. Audio transmissions captured the pilot telling an air traffic controller he needed to return to the airport and land immediately. Asked why, he said: “Number four-engine, we’d like to return and blow it out.”

Connecticut Public Safety Commissioner James Rovella said Wednesday at a news conference that some passengers on the plane were burned, adding ""the victims are very difficult to identify."" Rovella also warned the death toll could rise.

WORLD WAR II-ERA PLANE CRASHES AT BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN CONNECTICUT, 7 REPORTED DEAD

While authorities have not yet officially identified any of the victims of the crash, a woman who said her husband was on the aircraft at the time posted a letter to Facebook confirming his death after a ""long and tragic day."" Debra Riddell, of East Granby, Conn., said her husband Robert was among the seven dead, writing ""words cannot express how devastated I am.""

""He was brilliant, loving, funny, reliable, compassionate and the best man I’ve ever known. The world lost an amazing person today,"" she wrote. ""My heart goes out to the other people that lost loved ones but especially the people who survived this crash.""

""He was my soul mate, I will miss him beyond [what] words can ever express,"" his wife wrote.

In the moments before the deadly crash, Robert Riddell posted to Facebook detailing his excitement about the flight.

In a final post, Riddell shared a photo from inside the plane as it was taxiing for takeoff. ""Not much of a view from the seats,"" he wrote.

FLORIDA SMALL PLANE CRASH KILLS 3 AFTER AIRCRAFT SLAMS INTO WOODED AREA, CATCHES FIRE

At the news conference Wednesday, Rovella said some lives were likely saved by the efforts of people on the ground who reacted swiftly, including a person who raced to help the victims and people on the plane who helped others to escape the fire by opening a hatch, he told reporters.

“You’re going to hear about some heroic efforts from some of the individuals that were in and around that plane,” he said.

The man that opened the hatch in the plane was a member of the Connecticut Air National Guard command chief, according to the National Guard. The airman, current command chief for the 103rd Airlift Wing and a trained C-130 loadmaster, brought his military-issued flame-retardant flight gloves with him during the flight and was able to open the hatch on the aircraft ""allowing other passengers to egress the plane after the crash.""

Police told WTNH the man, who authorities asked not to be identified, was sitting in the rear of the plane when it crashed.

“He is very familiar with the back of an aircraft,” Major General Francis J. Evon told WTNH. ""Our understanding is he popped the hatch and was able to extract some individuals.”

National Guard officials said the man was suffered injuries in the crash and was transported to Hartford Hospital for treatment. He was released by Thursday night and is recovering at home.

""Any further details on his specific actions will be revealed through the investigation,"" the National Guard said in a statement to FOX61.

Some of the survivors of the crash were critically injured, authorities said. One person on the ground was also hurt in the crash and a firefighter involved in the response suffered a minor injury. No children were on the plane. Six patients were taken to Hartford Hospital, including two firefighters, FOX61 reported.

The National Transportation Safety Board sent a 10-person team to investigate the cause of the crash.

Officials in the town of Windsor issued a warning about the potential release of firefighting foam used in response to the crash into the Farmington River that could lead to health concerns, FOX61 reported.

The retired, civilian-registered plane was associated with the Collings Foundation, an educational group that brought its Wings of Freedom vintage aircraft display to the airport this week, officials said.

The B-17 that went down Wednesday was built in 1945, too late to see combat in the war, according to the Collings Foundation.

The vintage bomber also crashed in 1987 at an air show near Pittsburgh, injuring several people, the Collings Foundation said. Hit by a severe crosswind as it touched down, the bomber overshot a runway and plunged down a hill. It was later repaired.

The crash Wednesday reduces to nine the number of B-17s actively flying, Rob Bardua, a spokesman for the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, near Dayton, Ohio, told the Associated Press.

TEAM TRUMP CONSIDERS APPEALING TO DEMS IN GOP DISTRICTS

WaPo: “White House officials intent on stopping the House from impeaching President Trump are considering appealing to moderate Democrats in Republican districts to stand with the president, a pursuit at odds with fresh political attacks from the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. The nascent outreach campaign would target some of the 31 Democrats from congressional districts Trump won in 2016, many of whom ran on rebuilding infrastructure, improving trade deals and lowering the cost of prescription drugs, according to multiple officials familiar with the strategy. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the appeal would be based on these Democrats’ 2018 election promises to work with the president — accompanied with a warning that impeachment would hamper possible legislative victories.”



Impeachment vets urge caution - AP: “But the Republicans who carried out President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 are unanimous in urging caution and restraint as Congress embarks on yet another impeachment struggle, this time over accusations that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son. The impeachment veterans of two decades ago were thrust into a seismic political event that was sober and circus-like at the same time. So began a new, angry chapter of American politics that strained Washington institutions that were stronger then than now. … Today, those Clinton impeachment Republicans are urging a pause in the tribalism of the Trump era. … The best-known is Lindsey Graham, a former Air Force prosecutor who was among those most aggressively gunning for Clinton. … The most senior of two Clinton prosecutor remaining in the House is Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin... Clinton impeachment manager Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, wasn’t eager to take a walk down memory lane when encountered in the Capitol last week…”



Kraushaar: The impeachment bellwethers - National Journal: “All told, the numbers suggest that while the politics of impeachment hearings now favor the Democrats, the prospect of building enough bipartisan support to remove Trump from office remains remote. … It’s easy to expect the Republican base remaining solidly behind the president regardless of new information, but it’s hard to see how the broader politics improve for Trump or his party. Despite the partisanship, there are still many members of Congress whose perspective on impeachment going forward will be worth watching closely. They’re the bellwethers, the swing votes whose forthcoming reactions will reflect the mood of the country. There are four categories of members I’m closely watching: the swing-state Republicans, the red-state Democrats, the Republican retirees, and the swing-district freshman Democrats with national security experience.”



Jim Geraghty: Don’t obsess over whistleblower - National Review: “Here’s an assessment sure to be unpopular: When the story of the impeachment effort against President Trump is written, the whistleblower will be an afterthought or a minor player in the overall story at most. Either the whistleblower’s claims are accurate, or they aren’t. Impeachment will hinge upon whether President Trump’s actions strike lawmakers as an effort to effectively blackmail Ukraine into finding dirt on Joe Biden, or whether it’s just Trump being Trump, wanting the facts on Biden strong-arming a foreign government to fire a prosecutor who might have been investigating a company that employed his son. The vast majority of lawmakers’ conclusions on this will just happen to align with their partisan affiliations.”



Schumer continues to press McConnell - Politico: “Chuck Schumer wants Senate Democrats to keep the pressure on Mitch McConnell to hold a fair trial if impeachment of President Donald Trump comes to the Senate — but he also wants to keep whacking the majority leader for presiding over a ‘legislative graveyard.’ The Senate minority leader convened a conference call with his caucus on Wednesday to stay focused on its double-barreled messaging tactics while his 47 members are scattered across the country in the middle of a two-week recess, according to three people familiar with the call. … Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged his colleagues to not act partisan amid the impeachment inquiry and pressure McConnell (R-Ky.) to commit to a fair process if the House impeaches the president, according to a Democratic aide briefed on the call. … A second Democrat briefed on the call said some in the party are anxious for more strategic guidance from party leaders.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Trump attacks his own presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains the Democrats’ evidence against President Trump and why he should present a principled defense if he has one: “Federal law defines as criminal the solicitation of aid – anything of value – for a political campaign from a foreign national or foreign government, whether the thing of value arrives or not. Federal law also prohibits bribery and attempted bribery, which is defined as withholding the performance of an official duty conditioned upon the personal receipt of a thing of value, whether the thing of value arrives or not. The law further prohibits intimidating witnesses, which is defined as the use of language designed to deter witnesses from giving testimony, whether the intimidation is successful or not.” More here.

Smithsonian: “With its cheery singles, theatrical medley and iconic cover, The Beatles’ 11th studio album, ‘Abbey Road,’ holds a special place in the hearts of the band’s fans. But as the album celebrates its 50th anniversary, few may realize just how groundbreaking its tracks were for the band. In [William D. Moylan’s] forthcoming book, ‘Recording Analysis: How the Record Shapes the Song,’ [he shows] how the recording process can enhance the artistry of songs, and ‘Abbey Road’ is one of the albums [he highlights]. Beginning with 1965’s ‘Rubber Soul,’ The Beatles started exploring new sounds. This quest continued in ‘Abbey Road,’ where the band was able to deftly incorporate emerging recording technology in a way that set the album apart from everything they had previously done. … ‘Abbey Road’ … shows how a song can be poetically written and an instrument deftly played. But the way a track is recorded can be the artist’s final stamp on the song.”

DEMS GRUMBLE OVER LARGE DEBATE STAGE

Politico: “The next Democratic presidential primary debate will likely be historic — but probably not for the reason Democrats were hoping. The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that 12 candidates have qualified for the Oct. 15 debate in Westerville, Ohio. And unlike the previous rounds, when the stage was limited to 10 candidates, which resulted in the first two debates being split into two consecutive nights, all 12 are set to share one stage on Oct. 15.This would make it the largest presidential primary debate ever, Republican or Democrat… Invited to the debate are: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. If none of the candidates drop out between now and the debate — and Sanders participates in the debate after his recent heart procedure — it will surpass the previous record of 11 candidates on a primary debate stage, set by Republicans during the 2016 cycle. The crowded stage is leading to some grumbling from Democrats, who are already conscious about their speaking time.”



Biden tries to fashion a Super Tuesday firewall - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its investment in Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March. The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling figures have declined and Elizabeth Warren’s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire where she’s heavily invested in field organization. The former vice president’s campaign is still counting on strong finishes in the four early nominating states. But in the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden. Many of the states on the Super Tuesday map — which includes a handful of Southern and Border states — play to his strengths among African-American voters and more moderate Democrats.”



Molly Ball: Harris remains an enigma to voters - Time: “Perhaps, in these days of brutal ideological combat, that kind of pragmatism could be sold as refreshing. But in Harris’ case it seems to be having the opposite effect. Some of the attendees at her events in Iowa told me they don’t think she’s progressive enough; others said she strikes them as too far left. ‘She hasn’t gone far enough to get the activists behind her, but she’s gone too far for some of the moderates,’ says Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. ‘So she’s in kind of a no-person’s-land in terms of having a good base.’ And yet, polls indicate that Democratic voters still want to like her–if only they can figure out what she’s about. The race is far from over. Iowa voters are notorious for shopping around until the end.”



Klobuchar leans on family’s Iron Range roots - Roll Call: “If there’s proof of Klobuchar’s strengths as a candidate, it’s her margins in conservative parts of Minnesota. Despite Trump winning the 8th District — home to the Iron Range — by 16 points in 2016, and Democrats losing the seat last fall, Klobuchar carried it by more than 10 points in her 2018 reelection. But as Democrats have seen slippage in the Midwest, so has Klobuchar. Her margins last year in some conservative congressional districts were significantly lower than in 2012. Before she can try to extend that Minnesota success nationwide, she has to win over the Democratic Party base. ‘It would be unlikely,’ [University of Minnesota professor Larry] Jacobs said. ‘But I never give up on Amy Klobuchar. No one is going to outwork her.’”

AUDIBLE: THAT’S SOME PRETTY THICK BATTER

“There are different ways to bake the cake, depending on what sort of cake you want. Different flavoring, different temperatures, different ingredients yield different types of cake, and the president as the master baker is testing recipes and deciding what type of cake he wants.” – A senior White House official talking to the WaPo about President Trump’s freestyle solo approach to impeachment messaging.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I do enjoy reading the Halftime report and especially the From the Bleachers section where I can see how others are reacting to what they read. Your responses are usually spot on but [on Tuesday] I took umbrage to your calling the impeachment process ‘festivities’. While politics in general tends to resemble Battlebots and political conventions are certainly festive the gravity of what is taking place in Washington now should be handled with more seriousness. The potential removal of a duly elected president regardless of the outcome will leave wounds on this country that will take a long time to heal. We may not recognize our Republic when all is said and done due to the scars left behind. One can only hope that later generations can learn where we failed to, so that Impeachment, or the threat of it, is not used as a political tool every 4 years and never becomes something resembling a festival.” – Dave Fischer, Memphis, Tenn.



[Ed. note: I know that it’s very tempting to think the worst, Mr. Fischer. It not only seems more dramatic and historic than being optimistic, it also fits into the nation’s dour mood these days. I know it’s also tempting to take umbrage. In fact, umbrage taking has become sort of our new national pastime. The outrage olympics have overtaken our politics in a profound way. And while I do feel bad that you were offended at my jocularity, I am going to continue to decline to take politics so seriously. The issues at stake are too important to hang on every word of politicians. There’s no way around the partisan conflict ahead, but I still tend to think that there’s something better waiting on the other side. I’m grateful for your readership and hope you can stick with us despite my commitment to due flippancy.]



“Some are saying in the Senate trial, assuming the president is impeached, that the president’s attorneys will have the opportunity to subpoena and question anyone. By anyone, they’re suggesting Comey, Strzok, Page, Ohr, Holder, Lynch, Steele, Brennan, Clapper, not to mention Hilary Clinton… quite literally, anyone. It’s difficult to imagine that this is so, but, if it is, well, the country’s in for a tantalizing, and surely painful, show…” – B. A. Street, Colorado Springs, Colo.



[Ed. note: The Senate gets to make up its own trial rules. How long, how many witnesses, in what order, etc. would all be up for grabs if the House impeaches. I think the scenario you describe – weeks of confusing testimony going down alternate narratives, etc. – would be a bipartisan nightmare. Instead, I expect senators would prefer tight, concise presentations.]

WTAE: “An alligator was found in Pittsburgh Tuesday night, according to Humane Animal Rescue. The gator, which Humane Animal Rescue named ‘Gus,’ was found near the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood. … George DeSavage and his girlfriend spotted the alligator. He said, ‘We were just down there sitting watching the sunset by the river and I happened to glance down and see it just sitting there.’ DeSavage said he wanted to save the animal and possibly prevent a dangerous situation for someone else. … He said grabbing the alligator was the right thing to do. ‘It was calm. It seemed like it was handled by somebody before because as soon as I grabbed it, it went kind of limp and calm and didn't squirm or try and fight or anything,’ DeSavage said. Police showed up and Gus is at humane animal rescue in Homewood.”

Guy Benson [00:00:00] We continue it's the Guy Benson show. Thanks for being here. Guy Benson show dot.com. Joining me now is Congressman Dan Crenshaw a Republican from Texas the 2nd Congressional District in the Lone Star State the Houston area. He's a former Navy SEAL and a repeat guest here on the program we always appreciate having him.

Guy Benson: Hello Congressman.

Rep. Crenshaw: Hey Guy It's great to be with you.

Guy Benson: Let's start with the soundbite today from the president at the White House cut 16 talking about Biden and investigations and foreign countries. This is a triple down. Have a listen.

TRUMP: China should start an investigation into the Biden's because what happened to China. Is just about as bad as what happened with. With. Ukraine. So I would say that president Zelensky if it were me I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Biden's because nobody has any doubt that they weren't crooked. That was a crooked deal 100 present.

Guy Benson: All right Congressman so there's the president. We remember what he said about Russia and hacking in 2016. Here he goes again saying that the Chinese and the Ukrainians should be investigating the Bidens. Your reaction to that is that's something the president ought to be saying.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well what we should be saying is listen the public does have an interest in knowing this.

Rep. Crenshaw: Former Vice President Biden had a serious conflict of interest that he was advocating for this Ukrainian prosecutor fired when he knew the prosecutor was investigating the company that his son was a board member. And there is a public interest in knowing that. And so you know that the president uses very loose language every time he speaks. He's talked about investigating. I'm not sure any of where the illegal on regarding Ukraine. It wasn't illegal according to Ukrainian law. All right. Any legal part of Ukrainian law. What I care about is whether there was legitimate conflict of interest and just on the facts we have it would appear that there was whether that's illegal is another question whether it really warrants a so-called investigation. Is Another question. And it really is a political calculation if they do it. Do we trust someone who so blatantly had a conflict of interest and they recuse themselves that the facts we have or are frankly involved and just getting to the core of the current debate about about Trump's transcripts. I I will say that I will defend the idea that the public does have an interest in knowing about these things it's not out of the ordinary for the future.

Rep. Crenshaw: The current president to be asking about wrongdoing of U.S. officials.I think the public does have an interest in that.

Guy Benson: There is a public interest certainly but do you try to deputize a foreign government to do the digging in the course of practicing U.S. foreign policy when you're the president. Right. I think that's an important distinction about who's doing the digging who's asking whom to do the digging and when it comes to Biden Ukraine. I'm not saying that his hands are clean but it looks like the prosecutor that he was pushing to get fired was in fact extremely corrupt was not investigating Hunter Biden at the time. I just feel like there's there's a lot of assertions being made all over the place. Congressman I'm not saying you I'm just saying all over the place on both sides of the aisle that I'm not sure that we're following the facts necessarily.

Rep. Crenshaw: Perhaps I like I said whether it's illegal or not and it's kind of irrelevant. I think it's obvious that there was a conflict of interest. It would have been appropriate for the vice president to recuse himself on that. Whether you take any more action on that subject after after that is more questionable. But to your point about listen is it ever appropriate to ask another country to investigate some kind of wrongdoing. I'm not so sure I see a problem with that. It depends on what the investigation is about. Is it official wrongdoing by U.S. officials. Yeah I don't think it's inappropriate to be signaling to other countries of which we've done in the past with that forget that just a year ago there was a letter signed to the Ukrainian government by three Democrat senators asking them to investigate. TRUMP So this is this is this is clearly not unprecedented and we didn't raise any issues back then in 2018. So those again and just normal diplomatic affairs isn't actually out of the ordinary. Trump has the ability to make everything seem out of the ordinary by the way he speaks but we do have to pay attention to the substance of what he's actually saying and the precedent that's already set.

Guy Benson: Sure in the context and what exactly he's requesting and is there an explicit quid pro quo. I think people are getting out over their skis as usual in their criticism of him. I just I don't know Congressman I feel like if if you are looking at a president or asking a foreign government to investigate that president's domestic political rival in the context of any conversation about foreign aid I think that's the type of thing that should not be done and should be avoided. I'm not saying it's impeachable I'm not saying it's illegal I just think it's not a correct use of one's public office do you. Do you disagree with that.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah you're making a style of it it's it's a question of style right.

Rep. Crenshaw: It's a question of whether it's appropriate for that phone call.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well it's an extremely important distinction like whether it's illegal and certainly whether it's unprecedent. And I think we have to be we have to be to think coherently about this is if you're asking a foreign government to investigate somebody's personal life because they're your political rival. Well that's a very different thing than saying that hey we have questions about what happened when this person was in office. You don't get it. You don't get a pass just because you're now running against the current president. Right. Imagine if that was the case imagine so you have to do is run against the current political leadership in all your past wrongs would never be questioned as a result because it would be somehow inappropriate to ask another government about that. I think that's crazy. So again like I like I started out with there is a public interest in knowing about about why the vice president was so involved in this one prosecutor in a foreign country when it just so happens that his son that there was a connection with the son. And why why he wasn't recused from that why the State Department wasn't taking lead on that. I think there's real questions there. OK. Trump was asking him to investigate my personal life. Would that be a different story. Right so I distinguish between those factors.

Guy Benson: I am not arguing that Biden is immune here I also think that you can look at something and say that's a misuse of power and not say well that's a crime and let's throw someone out of office. And I think what we've seen and this is where the Democrats start to come into some trouble they many of them have been saying they want to impeach the president since before he even took office. And one of the public faces of that push who has been I think pretty reckless and irresponsible and dishonest all along the path has been the chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the house Adam Schiff. And now there's a move among GOP leadership to have him censured in the house. Where do you stand on the leadership of Chairman Schiff and this censure resolution.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well he clearly one of the most dishonest members of Congress that we know of with what the Russian probe him claiming and evidence that he did not.

Rep. Crenshaw: It's now coming out that he was he was well aware of this whistleblower and the complaints being made before it was made public even though it was planned otherwise. You know his his parody account in an official hearing at a congressional hearing was supposed to act like adults.

Rep. Crenshaw: This man does a Shakespearean parody account of what the actual transcript was between Trump and and Ukrainian president. I mean it's just disgusting behavior. This man is a liar you should not be trusted that he runs a very powerful and important committee that was ever meant to be so politicized. By the way did the intelligence committee was never meant to be in the public eye. The way it is it is supposed to be a bipartisan way to conduct official national security matters in the country.

Rep. Crenshaw: And it is not what he is capable of doing and it's just it's it's sad to see that.

Guy Benson: You know one of your colleagues on the Republican side who I think is a pretty smart and serious person is at Elise Stefanik from New York. She's not someone given to spasms of insane partisanship and she's come out in the last 24 hours and said that Schiff needs to step down as the chairman of that committee I think the chances of that are nil. Pelosi is going to go to bat for her chairman but I almost wonder does that politically speaking almost help the president because Schiff has such a credibility problem if he's out there as the tip of the spear on this impeachment stuff that might not be terribly helpful to the Democrats who want to at least put on a somber serious face as they go down this path.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah I mean that's exactly right. A ton of respect for her. And that's exactly right.

Rep. Crenshaw: She doesn't. She takes a very objective look at people's behavior and policy as I had a do I and now she's calling for that there's some substance to it she's obviously no that committe she deals with this every day and you know should take her at her word. And to your point yeah there's a there's a real credibility problem. OK. Adam Schiff has lied to us for years about about the Russia Collusion Hoax the evidence he had lying to us again you know and again to into your last point prior about you know whether it's wrong or appropriate but not illegal.

Rep. Crenshaw: You know I would I would still push back in this case because we're assuming that there was some quid pro quo but it turns out after we get the transcript there's really no evidence of that. And that's a really important distinction to make. If if there was an obvious political quid pro quo our view on this should change. But the evidence is just not there. And the media narrative seems to be operating on that premise and it's a false premise.

Guy Benson: Congressman last question we have about a minute left. We've seen Elizabeth Warren propose in the last few days taxing speech. Kamala Harris writing to Twitter saying that the president's Twitter feed should be shut down. And of course the ongoing spat with better raw who's out there talking about gun confiscation. I mean first and second amendments I'm a little nervous about this crowd over there.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah they really like the Bill of Rights. I think they've made that very clear and and that's it. If you want to understand who Democrats are they believe in pure democracy in a pure democracy 51 percent the population can can can can club the rest of the 49 percent.

Rep. Crenshaw: They can change what they can tell them what they think what to do what they can own what they can't own what they can say what they can't say. Democrats believe that it's in the name then Democrat Republicans believe.

Guy Benson: Yes and thankfully Congressman we have a republic if we can keep it. Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas. Always a pleasure sir. We gotta go. Taking a break. Back next on THE GUY BENSON show."

* Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders remains hospitalized, but according to his wife, the Vermont senator will not need any additional medical procedures and he expects to participate in the Democratic primary debate scheduled for Oct. 15.

* Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, which is a very impressive haul, and puts her second only to Bernie Sanders’ $25.3 million quarter. [Update: I added this item after originally publishing the round-up.]

* Reinforcing impressions that Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign sees Joe Biden as a threat, the president’s operation is launching a $1 million ad buy in early primary states, airing a new attack ad peddling a discredited conspiracy theory involving the former vice president and Ukraine.

* Speaking of Biden, the Democratic campaign announced yesterday that it raised $12.5 million in the third quarter. It’s an underwhelming haul, which is roughly half the money Sanders raised over the same three-month period.

* For his part, Biden is moving forward with a $6 million ad buy in the first four states holding 2020 nominating contests.

* At an official White House event in Florida yesterday, Trump discussed 2020 campaign strategy, went after Elizabeth Warren with his “Pocahontas” slur, and labeled Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe.” It served as a reminder that the president obviously has no qualms about blurring the lines of propriety ahead of 2020.

* In an increasingly common dynamic in the GOP, former Rep. Pete Sessions (R) is launching a comeback bid in a new congressional district. Sessions lost last year in Texas’ 32nd district – an area he’d represented for more than two decades – so he’s now moving to Texas’ 17th district, which will be home to an open-seat contest next year.

* A new Washington Post-Schar School poll shows Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) with a 47% approval rating, despite his recent racial controversy. The same poll found Trump with a 39% approval rating in the commonwealth.

* And in Ohio, the latest Emerson poll shows Biden narrowly leading Sanders, 29% to 27%, with Warren not far behind with 21%. Also of note, the survey found each of the Democratic contenders leading Trump in Ohio in hypothetical general election match-ups."

* Much of the Democrats’ 2020 field participated in an MSNBC policy forum yesterday on addressing gun violence. NBC published a live-blog of the event.

* The lineup and podium order for the next Democratic presidential primary debate was announced yesterday, and it will be a one-night, 12-candidate event.

* With only a month remaining ahead of Louisiana’s gubernatorial race, Trump is urging his followers in the state to support either Eddie Rispone (R) or Ralph Abraham (R), one of whom is likely to advance to a probable runoff against incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D).

* Similarly, with time running out in Mississippi’s gubernatorial race, the president is throwing his support behind Tate Reeves’ (R) candidacy, arguing yesterday that his rival, state Attorney General Jim Hood (D), is “pro-Crooked Hillary.” In case anyone’s curious, the 2016 election was 1,058 days ago."

""Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,"" Orthman said.

Details of the ""inappropriate behavior"" were not immediately available, but a source told Politico there were no reports of sexual assault.

McDaniel released a statement saying he'd ""separated"" from the campaign, according to Politico.

""I have tremendous respect for my colleagues despite any disagreements we may have had and believe departing at this time is in the best interest of both parties,"" he said. ""I would never intentionally engage in any behavior inconsistent with the campaign or my own values. If others feel that I have, I understand it is important to listen even when you disagree. I wish the campaign and my colleagues well.""

McDaniel is a veteran of Democratic campaigns, having previously worked as the field and political director for Sen. Doug Jones' successful bid for the U.S. Senate in a 2017 special election. During the 2016 campaign, McDaniel worked as Hillary Clinton's primary-states regional director in the 2016 campaign and was political director for the Democratic Party of Georgia during the first half of 2015.

TRUMP BACKERS TORMENT WARREN IN NEVADA

A series of polls released this week shows Warren leading Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden both among national voters and in early primary and caucus states.

BERNIE SANDERS HAS STENTS INSERTED AFTER DOCTORS FIND BLOCKAGE

Sanders took a break from the trail this week after he ended up in the hospital with heart complications and underwent an emergency procedure Tuesday to repair a blocked artery, according to his campaign.

""We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,"" Sanders' campaign said in a statement.

Varney argued that Sanders' hospital visit lends credence to those questioning whether his age will get in the way of securing a spot in the Oval Office.

""There are now obvious questions about whether a 78-year-old can endure months of exhausting campaigning,"" he said.

Varney then turned to Biden, who has come under fire since the launch of a formal impeachment investigation against President Trump over the content of a phone call during which Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Biden and son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

""He is a casualty of the impeachment, he is collateral damage,"" said Varney. ""All the attention given to the Ukraine call has brought back the question about Hunter Biden, and the money he received in Ukraine and China.""

""It all happened so quickly,"" he continued, ""but as of now, it's Elizabeth Warren's nomination to lose.""

However, Varney said he didn't think Warren could win the general election in November 2020 ""for two reasons.""

""I don't think Americans will elect as president someone who wants to destroy our economic system,"" he said. ""Elizabeth Warren is a socialist. Her proposals would destroy capitalism, and with it, the prosperity we enjoy today.""

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Varney said the second reason was due to Warren's ""demeanor,""

""Anger is Senator Warren's frequent theme, hating capitalism, the rich, the billionaires, Wall Street -- that plays well to socialists, but on your screens, every day for four years, anger is not so attractive,"" he said. ""... You've got to be good on TV to win these days.""

Varney also issued a warning to Democrats, saying they should be ""very worried,"" should ""far-left"" Warren win the nomination.

""Far-left Warren is now very likely to be the nominee and outside of California and New York, Democrats should be very worried,"" he concluded.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Bill Hemmer, Verma said President Trump's executive order – which would expand the program's private insurance option – is ""all about demonstrating his vision to protect and secure the Medicare program.""

In the executive order, the Trump administration claims his Medicare plan will:

Provide more plan choices and time with providers

Streamline approval of therapies

Reform link payments with value

Eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse

Reduce regulation

‘MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SPONSOR SAYS PLAN WOULD GUT 1 MILLION PRIVATE INSURANCE JOBS

""He's just building on the tremendous success that we've already had with the program,"" she told Hemmer. ""President Trump's Medicare program is putting money back into the pockets of seniors. We've lowered out-of-pocket costs for drugs and for doctors' visits.""

She added that Medicare Advantage rates were announced at historic lows, citing lower Part D premiums and decreases in drug pricing.

Medicare itself remains popular, but 2020 Democratic presidential candidates' calls to enact a single-payer, government-run system for everyone are far more controversial. Speaking to a retirement community in Florida on Thursday, the president said Democrats want to ""raid Medicare to fund the idea of socialism.""

""All of the Democrats' plans would totally devastate our health care plans,"" he exclaimed.

Sanders' ""single-payer"" approach would cover people of any age and would incorporate the Medicare program. Private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option used by about one-third of seniors, would no longer have a role.

Sanders, who underwent a heart procedure this week, has argued that ""Medicare-for-all"" would offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs.

""In all of these versions, whether it's 'Medicare-for-all' or the public option ... what they're talking about is a government takeover of our private health care system stripping 180 million Americans from private coverage and putting them into a government-run program,"" Verma explained.

""What we've seen from other countries that have tried these socialist experiments is that that leads to reductions in care, reduced access, long wait times, and rationing of care,"" she said.

FELLOW 2020 CANDIDATE CALLS BERNIE'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN A 'LOSING BATTLE' THAT WILL SET COUNTRY BACK 10 YEARS

""These types of options that we're hearing from people, would eviscerate the Medicare program. and, it would put our seniors in a situation where they're waiting in line for their care,"" Verma stated.

""President Trump has a very different vision,"" she concluded. ""He wants to strengthen and protect the Medicare program, make it better for seniors.""

The tech mogul said Facebook would sue the federal government if Warren wins in 2020 and tries to break up his company.

""The Rich and Powerful Are Afraid of Elizabeth Warren"" flashes across the screen during the Instagram video, followed by a montage of clips from cable news channels including Fox News Channel, CNBC and Fox Business Network, showing hosts and guests opining that Wall Street and corporate America won't enjoy a Warren administration.

The Massachusetts senator, a Democrat, has proposed that Big Tech firms like Facebook, Amazon and Google be broken up over antitrust concerns. Facebook, which is currently the subject of at least three different probes of its business practices -- by the Justice Department, a group of state attorneys general and the House of Representatives -- was forced to pay the Federal Trade Commission a record-breaking $5 billion fine over privacy violations earlier this year.

""Well, it would be a sub-optimal situation for the banks,"" says one guest in the clip.

""The pharmaceutical industry would also similarly say, 'Watch out,'"" another guest warns.

""I think Elizabeth Warren is the dangerous one,"" claims a different guest.

""Are you telling me that the billionaires are not in favor of my being president of the United States?"" Warren asks at the close of the clip. ""I'm shocked!""

Warren ignored the protesters as they held up signs and continued to shout at her.

“Welcome to Reno ⁦@ewarren! This is @teamtrump country!!” Nevada Republican Party state Chairman Michael J. McDonald wrote in a separate tweet.

Warren spoke to a much larger and friendlier crowd in Carson City on Wednesday evening – but a Trump supporter holding a “Keep America Great” sign interrupted her speech, prompting the crowd of Warren backers to chant ""Lock him up!”

""There's a lot we need to do,” Warren said to the crowd, according to New York Times reporter Thomas Kaplan, who tweeted the video. “And I understand, I understand that Donald Trump and his supporters are getting really nervous, and they have a good reason to be.""

Support for Warren has surged among Democrats in recent weeks, with the candidate passing former Vice President Joe Biden by four points in a new national poll released this week.

Warren spoke earlier Wednesday at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas.

Biden was also in Nevada on Wednesday, making a campaign stop in Reno, where he attacked Trump for his alleged “abuse of power.”

Elizabeth Warren raked in $24.6 million during the July-September fundraising quarter, blowing past former Vice President Joe Biden and coming close to Sen. Bernie Sanders' field-leading haul.

The figure affirms the momentum Warren has appeared to be gaining in recent weeks and months, as polls show her now battling Biden – once the unrivaled front-runner – for the primary lead.

While Sanders remains in third position in many polls, his fundraising is unmatched, totaling $25.3 million in the third quarter.

BIDEN RAISES $15.2 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER, DOWN $6 MILLION FROM APRIL-JUNE HAUL

But Warren's campaign cash number comes close — and is far ahead of the $15.2 million raised by Biden in the last quarter.

Warren and Biden are essentially tied for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

The Massachusetts senator, who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another, announced her fundraising figures on Twitter, saying, “I’m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in.”

“Together, we’re building a movement that’s going to put power back in the hands of the people,” she pledged.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren’s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter.

Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

President Trump’s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

Asked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if she reaches the general election, Warren touted her ""grassroots movement"" and highlighted ""that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.""

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel and ads.

WARREN LAUGHS OFF HARRIS SUGGESTION TO BOOT TRUMP FROM TWITTER

And Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered a simple ""no"" when asked by reporters if she thought the Republican president should be booted from Twitter. The Massachusetts Democrat chuckled as she gave her one-word answer on Wednesday.

Harris called this week for the president’s Twitter account to be shut down. This followed a storm of tweets by Trump critical of the whistleblower who filed a complaint against him over the Ukraine controversy. That controversy has spurred a House impeachment inquiry.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Trump, in a tweet, also questioned whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff should be arrested for “treason.” And on Wednesday he called the House Democrats' investigation “BULLS---"" in one tweet and a ""COUP"" in another.

“The words of a president matter. Trump has again shown he is irresponsible and endangering others with his tweets. He should lose the privilege to be on Twitter,” Harris wrote on Twitter on Monday.

She urged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to take action.

Gabbard's comments weren't the first time she's disagreed with Harris.

The two candidates clashed in a viral moment at July’s Democratic primary debate, when Gabbard took aim at the former California attorney general over her record as a prosecutor.

Asked if her pushback against Harris’ suggestion to suspend Trump from Twitter was personal, Gabbard quickly answered, “No. I don’t know why anyone would think that.”"

Her bizarre behavior and backstory led to suspicions that she was a Chinese government spy, but she was not charged with espionage or related crimes.

CHINESE WOMAN FOUND GUILTY OF TRESPASSING AT MAR-A-LAGO

Zhang apparently purchased a $20,000 travel package from Li Weitian, also known as Charles Lee, who advertised tickets on the Chinese social media site WeChat promising access to events across the U.S. to meet prominent political and business figures.

Lee ran the United Nations Chinese Friendship Association, which is not affiliated with the U.N., and was photographed at least twice with Cindy Yang, a Republican donor and former Florida massage parlor owner who organized events at Mar-a-Lago.

Upon learning that the event at Mar-a-Lago had been canceled, Lee tried to convince Zhang to attend another event on Wall Street in New York City, text messages between the pair released by the South Florida court Thursday revealed. Bill and HIllary Clinton were scheduled to be there.

""Regarding the event at the Trump's estate, it's been put on hold for now. We can forget about it. We have two other activities now. I sent them to you already,"" Lee texted Zhang on March 26, four days before she was arrested on the Trump property.

At the time of her arrest, Zhang told federal agents that she did not know that the event had been canceled, a claim contradicted by her messages.

Lee urged Zhang to go to ""Clinton's event, Clinton and his wife Hillary,"" he said, offering her a ticket for $60,000. ""There are politicians and the finance people that you talked about wanting to meet in this event. You can meet with these two famous people in one setting. Hillary was the former Secretary of State, equivalent to the Prime Minister. That is very extraordinary. Er... you can stand in between them and have a photo taken.""

In the same message, Lee also says, ""You can also go to Buffett's event which is particularly for investment and finance,"" referring to business mogul Warren Buffett.

Lee also explained to her why the previously scheduled Trump event was allegedly canceled.

""Regarding the Trump's event, this is what happened. It's because the Democratic Party has all along been fighting with the Republican Party. He is from the Republican Party. They accused Trump of colluding with Russia. Recently the investigation said Trump did not. He's not guilty. The media is controlled by the Republic Party-- eh, the Democratic Party. That's why they are in trouble. Trump takes the revenge. So they now join together and attack Trump. ... In order to minimize the nonsense, they canceled his events for the time being.""

In subsequent messages, Zhang asked Lee for her money back after hearing of the cancellation but ended up traveling from Shanghai to Florida anyway. Her motives for going to the property and lying to Secret Service agents at Mar-a-Lago remain unclear."

""Well, yes they are,"" Harris told the crowd, sparking some laughter.

On the roster: Trump offers no off-ramps for Republicans - Time Out: Bon appétit, y’all - Warren, Sanders lap Biden in third quarter fundraising - The real reason the chicken crossed the road



TRUMP OFFERS NO OFF-RAMPS FOR REPUBLICANS

The news these days is pretty grim for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.



The central claim of the whistleblower who came forward to authorities was that President Trump was pressuring America’s Ukrainian allies for dirt on Trump’s chief political rival, Joe Biden.



It has not only been proven true, the president is now doing it right out in the open. He’s even added China to the list of foreign powers he wants to provide opposition research on the Democratic front runner.



Worse, newly revealed texts between American diplomats show that senior State Department officials believed that Trump was conditioning U.S. aid to the long-beleaguered former Soviet republic on the provision of anti-Biden goodies.



But in potentially the worst development so far, it is now alleged that Trump’s personal defense attorney was dangling the promise of an official diplomatic visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president in exchange for a public statement from the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his family’s business dealings in Kyiv.



Team Trump is having some success in deflecting attention, discrediting the California Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee (who’s doing a pretty good job of discrediting himself) and bringing increased attention to the younger Biden’s super-swampy business model.



But the damage is already done. Trump has admitted that the central allegations are true. He has been and is using his office for his own political advantage. All presidents do in more innocuous ways — Air Force One as campaign prop, “official” events as rallies, the White House as an extension of the campaign — but dragging diplomats and involving one of the most potentially dangerous parts of the globe is new.



For Trump loyalists who are in the shoot-‘em-on-Fifth-Avenue club, this is not a problem. They agree with the president that his conduct was “perfect.” They are also convinced that Trump’s predecessor did as bad or worse but was protected by the media. But for those who are not acolytes of Trumpism, including the persuadable voters he desperately needs to win back for re-election, this is turning toxic.



Add in news of an increasingly slouchy economy and you have perhaps the worst political run for this administration yet.



That’s not to say that it’s likely that Trump would ever be removed by the Republican-held Senate. The idea that 20 Republican senators would join Democrats in ousting Trump still sounds laughable.



But the president is certainly not helping his cause with a scorched earth strategy that provides no shelter for his less-fanatically-devoted allies.



Trump’s stance is that he did nothing wrong — again “perfect” — and that anyone who says so is part of the cabal trying to drive him from office.



That’s not going to cut it for lawmakers, especially for vulnerable Senate Republicans, as the 2020 election approaches. They need a space in between: Denunciation of dragging other countries into American politics while still saying Trump’s behavior doesn’t merit removal from office.



Bill Clinton’s team in 1998 knew they had to give Democrats a chance to denounce the president’s scuzzy behavior. Those denunciations actually strengthened Clinton’s standing in the Senate and with voters. He was being punished, formally and informally, and so wasn’t getting away with it. It helped turn him into a sympathetic figure.



Trump and his party are right now a long way from anything like that.



THE RULEBOOK: SERIOUS STUFF

“There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than [the executive department]; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 67



TIME OUT: BON APPÉTIT, Y’ALL

Garden&Gun: “Nearly any Southerner who grew up in the country—whether on one acre or ten thousand—has seen the damage feral hogs do, trampling and uprooting crops and native plants alike. Raised in a North Texas cattle-ranching family, Taylor Hall experienced firsthand the destruction—and one potential solution. ‘Some of the cowboys I worked with would kill them for pig roasts, gumbo, and so forth,’ he says. … Hall kicked around California kitchens before returning home to open his own restaurant, Apis, in the hills outside Austin. A must for his menu: wild pig. … Hall compares the meat with beef. ‘It’s a lot darker because it’s an animal that moves around a lot, so there’s more blood in its muscles. And with that, you’re going to get more of that iron-y, metallic flavor.’ At Apis, Hall cures the meat for charcuterie and grinds it to make a traditional, slow-cooked Italian ragù, a.k.a. Sunday gravy.”

WARREN, SANDERS LAP BIDEN IN THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING

Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign said Friday that it raised $24.6 million in the third quarter and has $25.7 million cash on hand, further solidifying her rise to the top tier in the Democratic primary. The haul bests the $19 million Warren raised last quarter but trails progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose third-quarter total of $25.3 million is the biggest one so far from the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Despite neither candidate holding traditional high-dollar fundraisers, Warren and Sanders both significantly outraised former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million) and Sen. Kamala Harris ($11.6 million). Warren’s team was alone among those campaigns to disclose its exact cash on hand. … [Campaign manager Roger] Lau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.”



Dem front-runners’ ages show larger issue for party - Politico: “Bernie Sanders’ hospitalization with a blocked artery this week finally forced the Democratic Party to confront a lingering fact: All three of its presidential front-runners are septuagenarians, and two are older than Donald Trump… For Sanders, the immediate effect of the incident — a blockage requiring two stents — was to sideline the 78-year-old senator until further notice… But the broader implications were also thrust into plain view: In a Democratic primary that was once expected to break along generational lines, a whole crop of younger contenders has fallen so far back that — even with an aging, top-tier contender laid up — it would take an upset for the party to mount a generational argument against Trump next year. Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — the youngest of the three at 70 — are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate’s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit. Instead, it is Sanders’ friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.”



Harris struggles to gain ground in home state - LAT: “When Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid, she counted California as a major asset. … But rather than serving as a foundation, California is exposing the cracks in her troubled campaign. Recent polling shows Harris mired in a distant fourth place, with support from fewer than 1 in 10 of those surveyed. … In part, the poor standing reflects problems that have plagued Harris nationwide: uneven debate performances, a shifting stance on issues and, perhaps above all, the lack of a clear and compelling message. But part of the explanation is California itself. The state is physically immense… It’s also astronomically expensive to advertise, and that makes it exceedingly difficult for a politician — even one elected three times to statewide office like Harris — to become well known, much less revered. In short, as other presidential hopefuls have painfully learned, there is no such thing in California as a home-state advantage.”



Walter Shapiro: Pete Buttigieg’s undeniable allure - New Republic: “Four months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren. With Sanders ailing and Kamala Harris sputtering, Buttigieg has enough money to go the distance (he has raised $44 million in the last six months) and enough polling support to guarantee his place on every debate stage. Whatever happens next, this youthful candidate with a long resume (Harvard, Rhodes Scholar, McKinsey analyst, failed statewide candidate, mayor, and intelligence officer in Afghanistan) has already emerged as the political surprise of 2019. And that raises a new question: Is Buttigieg, who would be four years younger than JFK if he were inaugurated in 2021, ready for the White House?”

THE REAL REASON THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD

Bangor [Maine] Daily News: “It all started around two weeks ago when [Kate] McCormick returned home from a day at Common Ground Fair… ‘I was really tired and I just wanted to go to bed,’ she said. ‘I lifted up the throw pillows [on my bed], and there was an egg under them.’ McCormick said all she could do at the time was laugh, and look for the nearest suspect. In this case, her 7-year-old German Shepherd-Labrador Retriever mix Jake. … Further investigation, however, revealed the culprit. ‘I started walking around my house and found little piles of chicken poo,’ McCormick said. … The next morning … McCormick was able to witness the hen’s antics first hand. ‘I was awake and the back door was open and before I knew it, I could hear a chicken walking up the stairs in my house,’ she said. … The entire process took around 15 minutes, McCormick said, since the chicken took the time to arrange the blankets and pillows into a sort of nest into which she laid the egg.”

Now, former Vice President Joe Biden has been eclipsed by three of his rivals for their party’s 2020 nomination in the crucial race for campaign cash.

Democratic strategists say the ""devastating number"" is a clear warning sign for Biden as he battles to be his party's 2020 standard-bearer.

WARREN, SANDERS, FAR AHEAD OF BIDEN IN DASH FOR CAMPAIGN CASH

Even the candidate acknowledges the deficit.

“We haven't raised what a lot of people have -- we got started way later than everybody else, but we’ve raised, this last quarter, $15 million, in the middle of summer,” Biden said Thursday at a fundraising event in Palo Alto, Calif.

The $15.2 million the former vice president brought in during the July-September third quarter of fundraising was down more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June quarter.

Perhaps more telling is the fact that it is far behind the $25.3 million that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont collected in the past three months, and the $24.6 million that Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised. Warren, the populist senator from Massachusetts, has surged in recent months, in donations and surveys, and is now essentially tied with Biden for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

For the second straight fundraising quarter, Biden was also outraised by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who took in $19.1 million in contributions to his campaign over the past three months.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“This is a devastating number for Joe Biden,” said a Democratic strategist who asked for anonymity in order to speak more freely.

With the kickoff primary and caucus voting just four months away, the strategist emphasized that “this is a time when candidates are supposed to be showing momentum and strength going into the early contests. This number shows that his operation is basically treading water and being left behind by more dynamic campaigns.”

Another Democratic consultant, who also asked to remain anonymous, warned that Biden’s fundraising figures “should raise some serious questions about whether Joe Biden has the chops to raise the money necessary to compete in a general election and whether he can excite the Democratic base that is giving is giving an enormous number of small-dollar contributions to other candidates.”

A longtime friend, adviser and fundraiser for Biden cautioned against reading too much into the third-quarter figures.

“I’m relatively happy with the Biden numbers. Obviously they could always be higher,” said Larry Rasky, who was a senior adviser on Biden’s unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 White House runs.

Rasky said that raising funds wasn’t “the top priority of the campaign” over the past three months, as staffers concentrated on building up grassroots support.

“I think the numbers give them what they need to compete and try and win in February,” he added. “Third quarter numbers are tough historically for candidates and a candidate like Joe who may not have as big a grassroots base as Sanders and Warren. But the number [will] get us there.”

And he predicted a more robust fundraising effort for the already-underway fourth quarter, spotlighting “it feels that way to me already. There’s more intensity as we start the quarter off.”

Biden has spent the better part of the primary season to date fending off attacks not only from President Trump, but from an array of primary rivals eager to take him down a peg. His poll numbers have remained strong in the face of it all, even as Warren's have risen. One question mark for Biden going forward involves his connection to the newly launched Trump impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill.

Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their business dealings in Ukraine. Critics say this amounted to seeking foreign assistance in a U.S. election.

But it's also cast a spotlight on the Bidens. Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned Biden's role pushing for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been looking into corruption at the company (though the prosecutor was viewed by officials in several countries as himself corrupt).

While Biden denies wrongdoing, a recent Monmouth University poll indicated that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure. The survey also spelled trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be reelected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

Biden may soon have some outside help, however, as he battles for the Democratic nomination.

Biden’s haul is a drop of more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June second quarter of fundraising, and is far behind the $25.3 million that nomination rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont brought in the past three months. It’s also less than the $19.1 million that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised in the third quarter.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

Highlighting the numbers, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz noted that “today’s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall. The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond. Our campaign unequivocally does, and builds on our strength each week.”

The Biden camp emphasized that 98 percent of all donations were from grassroots donors giving $200 or less, and that 56 percent of contributors in the past three months were new to the campaign.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

Among those yet to report third-quarter fundraising figures is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is tied with Biden for the lead position in most the recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

President Trump’s reelection team announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to officially file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. The third-quarter fundraising figures of the Democratic presidential candidates will be heavily analyzed and scrutinized. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel, and ads."

Reid calls it ‘gateway to the west’,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-harry-reid-calls-nevada-gateway-to-the-west-but-how-important-is-the-silver-state-in-2020,"LAS VEGAS -- Diversity. That’s what differentiates Nevada from Iowa and New Hampshire, and why former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., believes it’s crucial for any presidential candidate hoping to reach the White House to campaign in the Silver State.

“The reason I've indicated that it is so important that people come here -- there's no diversity in Iowa and New Hampshire. None. Here we've got what’s like the most of the rest of America,” Reid told Fox News. ""Candidates must realize that Nevada is a diverse state. It's different than Iowa. It's different than New Hampshire. It's a state that's very diverse.""

Many say that although Iowa has long been seen as the first litmus test for presidential candidates ever since Jimmy Carter was able to use it as a springboard that ultimately led him to the presidency in 1977 – it doesn’t represent the microcosm of diversity that is the United States.

EX-UKRAINE ENVOY KURT VOLKER TOLD LAWMAKERS HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT FORMER PROSECUTOR'S RELIABILITY, SOURCES SAY

Iowa’s population is 85 percent white and New Hampshire is 90 percent, while Nevada is a minority-majority state, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Although Nevada falls in third behind Iowa and New Hampshire in the national voting pecking order, the state represents the first chance for candidates to reach a diverse voter base that could prove to be an important bellwether in determining voter trends.

But the 2020 candidates don't seem to be paying much attention to the state. Top tier Democratic candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have only spent a handful of days in Nevada, compared to dozens in the other two early voting states.

According to Fox News data, Sen. Sanders has spent 10 days in Nevada, the most among the top three polling candidates, compared to 27 days in Iowa. Warren has spent nine days in Nevada, with Biden only visiting five times.

While it's a critical state, Nevada poses a challenge for candidates.

“They've all come here. I’d like to see them more, but I mean you have to understand that it's much easier to go to Iowa, much easier go to New Hampshire,” Reid told Fox News, adding that most of the candidates are from the East which makes it more difficult to get out to Nevada.

But, he noted, “they’re doing a pretty good job.”

Other than being racially and ethnically diverse, Nevada also has a large labor union presence, a critical voting bloc for Democratic candidates. Still, the candidates seem to be overlooking the state to save money -- and because, unlike the first two voter states, politics doesn't have the same fixation in Nevada.

""It really is a question of dollars and cents,” said Patrick Murray, director, Monmouth University Polling Institute. “Turnout is low. There is not a culture around the Nevada caucus like there is in Iowa and New Hampshire in terms of these voters really turning out, really getting engaged in this process early on.”

While Nevada represents a different voter base that is more encompassing of the nation as a whole, Democratic strategist Roger Fisk said if a candidate loses Iowa and New Hampshire the third state won’t matter.

“If you come in fourth or fifth in Iowa you can maybe spin that and live for another day in New Hampshire, but if you’re coming out of New Hampshire fourth or fifth then you never had to worry about Nevada at all,” Fisk said, calling Iowa the “biggest slingshot in the world” and referencing former President Barack Obama’s 2008 victory that energized his campaign.

Murray agreed.

“They can spend all the resources saying Nevada is going be the place where they really break out, but if they tank in Iowa [and] New Hampshire, it really doesn't matter because they're done at that point,” Murray said.

On the flip side, both Murray and Fisk noted that if there is no clear frontrunner coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, Nevada’s stock gets increasingly more significant – with Fisk adding that it could even “resuscitate” a campaign.

Local politicians said Nevada has more political importance than people realize -- and could make or break a presidential candidate.

Assemblyman William McCurdy II, chair of the Nevada Democratic Party, believes Nevada is that state that will ultimately “decide who the nominee will be” and who is “going to take on Trump in the general.”

“Candidates who have a statewide presence here, who are actually coming here more and more frequently, we see them being very, very strategic and focused on making sure that they're doing the work to turn out voters,” McCurdy II told Fox News.

McCurdy also noted changes to the caucus system to encourage higher voter turnout

“Our caucus is going to be one of the most expansive, accessible and transparent caucuses yet,” he said, adding that people will have the opportunity to vote early with preference cards translated in different languages.

That's an enthusiasm echoed by Reid, who has high expectations for 2020.

“I think 2020 should be really good because there's so much attention focused now. It's not two candidates. It's 10 candidates. And, I think we've had participation here that I didn't expect has been really very, very good. Even some of the so-called minor candidates are coming here all the time hoping they'll get a strike of lightning here sometime.”

Reid said Nevada will also play a critical role in the general election.

Although a September Fox News Poll has Biden leading President Donald Trump by 14 points, followed by Sanders at 8 points and Sen. Warren right at the margin of error, topping Trump by 6 points – Reid warns against ruling out Trump.

“My career goes back to a number of presidents and there's never been anything like Donald Trump. It's created a lot of anxiety in Nevada, the country and around the world … I have always said, 'don't count him out.' Even though he's amoral, he is a person who is always able to have a discussion on his terms,” Reid told Fox News, adding that “people think he's not very smart, I think he's really smart. He may not be well-read. He may not be very academic. But I think he has a sense of how to pick a fight.”"

Medicare itself remains popular, but the calls to enact a single-payer, government-run system for everyone are far more controversial. Signing the order at the Villages – a retirement community north of Orlando – Trump singled out Democrats he said want to “totally obliterate Medicare.”

“They want to raid Medicare to fund the idea of socialism,” Trump said. “All of the Democrats' plans would totally devastate our health care plans.”

Trump added, “Democratic health care proposals would put everyone into a single-payer, socialist government-run plan.”

‘MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SPONSOR SAYS PLAN WOULD GUT 1 MILLION PRIVATE INSURANCE JOBS

The president’s criticism of the Democrats' plan was squarely aimed at the Medicare-for-all proposals of candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Sanders’ “single-payer” approach would cover people of any age and would incorporate the Medicare program. Private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option used by about one-third of seniors, would no longer have a role.

Medicare Advantage, the private insurance option under Medicare, offers savings on premiums and an annual limit on out-of-pocket costs. They provide one-stop shopping, eliminating the need for separate supplemental insurance. Offered by major insurers, the plans also cover prescription drugs in most cases.

But there are trade-offs. Seniors joining a Medicare Advantage plan generally must accept limits on their choice of hospitals and doctors as well as prior insurer approval for certain procedures. If they change their minds and decide to return to traditional Medicare, they’re not always guaranteed supplemental “Medigap” coverage, which is also private.

Trump’s order directs his department to examine whether its current policies and practices put traditional Medicare ahead of the private Medicare Advantage option.

The order would seek to expand the range of additional services that can be offered by the private plans and would direct regulators to find more ways for seniors to financially benefit from plans that provide cost-efficient service.

FELLOW 2020 CANDIDATE CALLS BERNIE'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN A 'LOSING BATTLE' THAT WILL SET COUNTRY BACK 10 YEARS

Many Medicare Advantage insurers offer some dental and vision coverage, along with basics like transportation to medical appointments. But the industry lately has started to experiment with in-home assistance, including nutritious meals and financial help with safety-related home improvements.

Sanders, who underwent a heart procedure this week, has argued that Medicare-for-all would offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs. In a tweet on Wednesday, Sanders reiterated the support for his proposal and added that “no one should fear going bankrupt” because of a hospital trip.

""None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!""

Trump also took time during his speech to slam Democrats for opening an impeachment inquiry over a phone call the president had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. In it, he asked Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s family’s dealings in the country.

“It’s corruption going on right now,” Trump said, calling congressional leaders “Do Nothing Dems” and the inquiry ""a hoax.""

Christopher P. Hasson, 50, admitted to all four charges against him -- illegally possessing unregistered silencers, illegally possessing unserialized silencers, possession of a firearm by an unlawful user or addict of a controlled substance and illegal possession of a controlled substance -- in federal court in Greenbelt, Md.

He was not charged with any terror-related crimes.

The Coast Guard lieutenant was arrested in February in his Silver Spring, Md., home, where authorities said they found a stockpile of weapons, including 15 guns, smoke grenades, silencers and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, the opioid painkiller Tramadol and other items.

Federal prosecutors allege Hasson compiled a spreadsheet of names he planned to target and claimed the self-described white nationalist was hell-bent on the ""murder [of] innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.""

COAST GUARD OFFICER ORDERED TO JAIL, ACCUSED OF BEING 'DOMESTIC TERRORIST'

After Thursday's hearing, Hasson's public defender said the case had been “mischaracterized and sensationalized.”

Liz Oyer said Hasson “was not plotting a terrorist attack or any of the abhorrent acts that the prosecution has repeatedly speculated about but never actually charged.”

Some of the prominent figures whose names were listed on Hasson's spreadsheet included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; and Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.

Several cable TV personalities, including MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN's Chris Cuomo and Van Jones were also mentioned.

Investigators said Hasson searched for Scarborough’s home address in January and Googled “best place in dc to see congress people” and “civil war if trump impeached,"" according to The Washington Post.

Prosecutors said he also targeted two unidentified Supreme Court justices and two social media executives and also searched for their home addresses online.

Investigators said Hasson appeared to be inspired by Anders Behring Breivik, a Norwegian right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in a 2011 bomb attack and shooting rampage.

His lawyers filed a request last week to bar prosecutors from introducing evidence linking him to white supremacist views or associations. In 2017, Hasson wrote to a Nazi leader where he advocated for ""'focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland,"" according to prosecutors.

Hasson, who had served in the Marines, worked at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington as an acquisition officer to acquire advanced new cutters for the agency. He faces up to 31 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 31.

""I think Trump supporters feel the same way now. They are looked down on, written off, ignored, and they don't like it -- and that's why the Trump base remains solidly behind the president despite impeachment and a barrage of hatred from the media,"" he continued.

Some four in 10 voters have stuck with the president throughout his time in office, explained Varney, challenging the elites to ""peer out from their ivory towers"" to understand the issues that have faced everyday Americans in the last decade -- and he took aim at many of the Obama-era policies.

""And if anybody objected, well, you're just a racist bigot ... or as Hillary put it, a deplorable,"" said Varney -- referring to the term used by Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign as a derogatory label for Trump supporters.

Contrasting Trump's successes to what he deemed President Barack Obama's failed policies, Varney praised the incumbent for producing a ""flood of jobs.""

""The lowest-paid workers are making the biggest wage gains, our economy is the top performer in the industrial world, and the open border is gradually, being closed. Middle America, working America, is doing well and gets the respect and attention of this president,"" Varney said.

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Despite Trump's accomplishments, explained Varney, the elites are pushing to remove Trump from office and support his impeachment, because he doesn't ""conform to presidential norms.""

In a drafted letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg obtained by Fox News, Barr says the tech giant should not proceed with its plan unless it can ensure that ""there is no reduction to user safety"" and also include ""a means for lawful access to the content of communications"" to protect the public.

""We must find a way to balance the need to secure data with public safety and the need for law enforcement to access the information they need to safeguard the public, investigate crimes and prevent future criminal activity,"" the letter states. ""Not doing so hinders our law enforcement agencies' ability to stop criminals and abusers in their tracks.""

Facebook, which owns the end-to-end encrypted messaging service WhatsApp, is planning to offer the same type of encryption for Facebook Messenger and Instagram as part of its push to integrate the messaging services.

The letter echoes Barr's comments in July at a cybersecurity conference.

“Converting the internet and communications platforms into a law-free zone, and thus giving criminals the means to operate free of lawful scrutiny will inevitably propel an expansion of criminal activity,” he said at the event. ""If you remove any possibility that the cops are going to be watching a neighborhood, the criminals already in the neighborhood will commit a lot more crimes.""

The letter -- which is also signed by Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton -- points out that Facebook does a lot to crack down on illegal content.

In 2018, the social network made 16.8 million reports to the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, an organization it has worked with for years. In addition, more than 99 percent of content the tech giant takes action against is identified by machine learning and algorithms, rather than reports from actual users.

The admission puts the mayor on a long line of corrupt leadership in the city, which has been riddled with chronic budget problems.

Frank Gillam Jr. told the judge he stole funds raised from donors in Atlantic City and Philadelphia for the Atlantic City Starz for personal expenses between 2013 and 2018. He was elected mayor in 2017 after serving as a City Councilman.

He was released after posting a $100,000 bond with the court, but New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and other elected officials quickly called for him to resign. Plans were already being made for the City Council president to assume Gillam’s position.

Gillam, 49, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted in his trial, which is set for Jan. 7. Half of the money he stole was recovered from his home when FBI agents raided it in December, and he’s agreed to pay restitution for the fraud.

According to prosecutors, Gillam used the money for personal expenses such as luxury clothing, expensive meals and trips. He had solicited the donations using his political office under the false pretense they were for the youth basketball team or for school supplies for underprivileged children.

“When a scheme depletes (a) charity for children, it's unconscionable,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregory Ehrie. “But when the fraud is perpetrated by someone the public trusts, it damages the community's confidence in their public servants. This defendant betrayed the trust of his community and of people who wanted to improve the lives of children.”

Gillam’s lawyer, Harry Rimm, issued a defense that Gillam only admitted misusing private funds, not public money, which he argued made the mayor better than many of his predecessors. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy when Gillam took office in 2017 as its casino industry struggled.

At the news conference Wednesday, Rovella said some lives were likely saved by the efforts of people on the ground who reacted swiftly, including a person who raced to help the victims and people on the plane who helped others to escape the fire by opening a hatch, he told reporters.

“You’re going to hear about some heroic efforts from some of the individuals that were in and around that plane,” he said.

The man that opened the hatch in the plane was a member of the Connecticut Air National Guard command chief, according to the National Guard. The airman, current command chief for the 103rd Airlift Wing and a trained C-130 loadmaster, brought his military-issued flame-retardant flight gloves with him during the flight and was able to open the hatch on the aircraft ""allowing other passengers to egress the plane after the crash.""

Police told WTNH the man, who authorities asked not to be identified, was sitting in the rear of the plane when it crashed.

“He is very familiar with the back of an aircraft,” Major General Francis J. Evon told WTNH. ""Our understanding is he popped the hatch and was able to extract some individuals.”

National Guard officials said the man was suffered injuries in the crash and was transported to Hartford Hospital for treatment. He was released by Thursday night and is recovering at home.

""Any further details on his specific actions will be revealed through the investigation,"" the National Guard said in a statement to FOX61.

The National Transportation Safety Board sent a 10-person team to investigate the cause of the crash.

Officials in the town of Windsor issued a warning about the potential release of firefighting foam used in response to the crash into the Farmington River that could lead to health concerns, FOX61 reported.

The retired, civilian-registered plane was associated with the Collings Foundation, an educational group that brought its Wings of Freedom vintage aircraft display to the airport this week, officials said.

The B-17 that went down Wednesday was built in 1945, too late to see combat in the war, according to the Collings Foundation.

TEAM TRUMP CONSIDERS APPEALING TO DEMS IN GOP DISTRICTS

WaPo: “White House officials intent on stopping the House from impeaching President Trump are considering appealing to moderate Democrats in Republican districts to stand with the president, a pursuit at odds with fresh political attacks from the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. The nascent outreach campaign would target some of the 31 Democrats from congressional districts Trump won in 2016, many of whom ran on rebuilding infrastructure, improving trade deals and lowering the cost of prescription drugs, according to multiple officials familiar with the strategy. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the appeal would be based on these Democrats’ 2018 election promises to work with the president — accompanied with a warning that impeachment would hamper possible legislative victories.”



Impeachment vets urge caution - AP: “But the Republicans who carried out President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 are unanimous in urging caution and restraint as Congress embarks on yet another impeachment struggle, this time over accusations that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son. The impeachment veterans of two decades ago were thrust into a seismic political event that was sober and circus-like at the same time. So began a new, angry chapter of American politics that strained Washington institutions that were stronger then than now. … Today, those Clinton impeachment Republicans are urging a pause in the tribalism of the Trump era. … The best-known is Lindsey Graham, a former Air Force prosecutor who was among those most aggressively gunning for Clinton. … The most senior of two Clinton prosecutor remaining in the House is Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin... Clinton impeachment manager Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, wasn’t eager to take a walk down memory lane when encountered in the Capitol last week…”



Kraushaar: The impeachment bellwethers - National Journal: “All told, the numbers suggest that while the politics of impeachment hearings now favor the Democrats, the prospect of building enough bipartisan support to remove Trump from office remains remote. … It’s easy to expect the Republican base remaining solidly behind the president regardless of new information, but it’s hard to see how the broader politics improve for Trump or his party. Despite the partisanship, there are still many members of Congress whose perspective on impeachment going forward will be worth watching closely. They’re the bellwethers, the swing votes whose forthcoming reactions will reflect the mood of the country. There are four categories of members I’m closely watching: the swing-state Republicans, the red-state Democrats, the Republican retirees, and the swing-district freshman Democrats with national security experience.”



Jim Geraghty: Don’t obsess over whistleblower - National Review: “Here’s an assessment sure to be unpopular: When the story of the impeachment effort against President Trump is written, the whistleblower will be an afterthought or a minor player in the overall story at most. Either the whistleblower’s claims are accurate, or they aren’t. Impeachment will hinge upon whether President Trump’s actions strike lawmakers as an effort to effectively blackmail Ukraine into finding dirt on Joe Biden, or whether it’s just Trump being Trump, wanting the facts on Biden strong-arming a foreign government to fire a prosecutor who might have been investigating a company that employed his son. The vast majority of lawmakers’ conclusions on this will just happen to align with their partisan affiliations.”



Schumer continues to press McConnell - Politico: “Chuck Schumer wants Senate Democrats to keep the pressure on Mitch McConnell to hold a fair trial if impeachment of President Donald Trump comes to the Senate — but he also wants to keep whacking the majority leader for presiding over a ‘legislative graveyard.’ The Senate minority leader convened a conference call with his caucus on Wednesday to stay focused on its double-barreled messaging tactics while his 47 members are scattered across the country in the middle of a two-week recess, according to three people familiar with the call. … Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged his colleagues to not act partisan amid the impeachment inquiry and pressure McConnell (R-Ky.) to commit to a fair process if the House impeaches the president, according to a Democratic aide briefed on the call. … A second Democrat briefed on the call said some in the party are anxious for more strategic guidance from party leaders.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Trump attacks his own presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains the Democrats’ evidence against President Trump and why he should present a principled defense if he has one: “Federal law defines as criminal the solicitation of aid – anything of value – for a political campaign from a foreign national or foreign government, whether the thing of value arrives or not. Federal law also prohibits bribery and attempted bribery, which is defined as withholding the performance of an official duty conditioned upon the personal receipt of a thing of value, whether the thing of value arrives or not. The law further prohibits intimidating witnesses, which is defined as the use of language designed to deter witnesses from giving testimony, whether the intimidation is successful or not.” More here.

TIME OUT: THE TECH BEHIND MUSIC

Smithsonian: “With its cheery singles, theatrical medley and iconic cover, The Beatles’ 11th studio album, ‘Abbey Road,’ holds a special place in the hearts of the band’s fans. But as the album celebrates its 50th anniversary, few may realize just how groundbreaking its tracks were for the band. In [William D. Moylan’s] forthcoming book, ‘Recording Analysis: How the Record Shapes the Song,’ [he shows] how the recording process can enhance the artistry of songs, and ‘Abbey Road’ is one of the albums [he highlights]. Beginning with 1965’s ‘Rubber Soul,’ The Beatles started exploring new sounds. This quest continued in ‘Abbey Road,’ where the band was able to deftly incorporate emerging recording technology in a way that set the album apart from everything they had previously done. … ‘Abbey Road’ … shows how a song can be poetically written and an instrument deftly played. But the way a track is recorded can be the artist’s final stamp on the song.”

DEMS GRUMBLE OVER LARGE DEBATE STAGE

Politico: “The next Democratic presidential primary debate will likely be historic — but probably not for the reason Democrats were hoping. The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that 12 candidates have qualified for the Oct. 15 debate in Westerville, Ohio. And unlike the previous rounds, when the stage was limited to 10 candidates, which resulted in the first two debates being split into two consecutive nights, all 12 are set to share one stage on Oct. 15.This would make it the largest presidential primary debate ever, Republican or Democrat… Invited to the debate are: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. If none of the candidates drop out between now and the debate — and Sanders participates in the debate after his recent heart procedure — it will surpass the previous record of 11 candidates on a primary debate stage, set by Republicans during the 2016 cycle. The crowded stage is leading to some grumbling from Democrats, who are already conscious about their speaking time.”



Biden tries to fashion a Super Tuesday firewall - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its investment in Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March. The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling figures have declined and Elizabeth Warren’s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire where she’s heavily invested in field organization. The former vice president’s campaign is still counting on strong finishes in the four early nominating states. But in the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden. Many of the states on the Super Tuesday map — which includes a handful of Southern and Border states — play to his strengths among African-American voters and more moderate Democrats.”



Molly Ball: Harris remains an enigma to voters - Time: “Perhaps, in these days of brutal ideological combat, that kind of pragmatism could be sold as refreshing. But in Harris’ case it seems to be having the opposite effect. Some of the attendees at her events in Iowa told me they don’t think she’s progressive enough; others said she strikes them as too far left. ‘She hasn’t gone far enough to get the activists behind her, but she’s gone too far for some of the moderates,’ says Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. ‘So she’s in kind of a no-person’s-land in terms of having a good base.’ And yet, polls indicate that Democratic voters still want to like her–if only they can figure out what she’s about. The race is far from over. Iowa voters are notorious for shopping around until the end.”



Klobuchar leans on family’s Iron Range roots - Roll Call: “If there’s proof of Klobuchar’s strengths as a candidate, it’s her margins in conservative parts of Minnesota. Despite Trump winning the 8th District — home to the Iron Range — by 16 points in 2016, and Democrats losing the seat last fall, Klobuchar carried it by more than 10 points in her 2018 reelection. But as Democrats have seen slippage in the Midwest, so has Klobuchar. Her margins last year in some conservative congressional districts were significantly lower than in 2012. Before she can try to extend that Minnesota success nationwide, she has to win over the Democratic Party base. ‘It would be unlikely,’ [University of Minnesota professor Larry] Jacobs said. ‘But I never give up on Amy Klobuchar. No one is going to outwork her.’”

AUDIBLE: THAT’S SOME PRETTY THICK BATTER

“There are different ways to bake the cake, depending on what sort of cake you want. Different flavoring, different temperatures, different ingredients yield different types of cake, and the president as the master baker is testing recipes and deciding what type of cake he wants.” – A senior White House official talking to the WaPo about President Trump’s freestyle solo approach to impeachment messaging.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I do enjoy reading the Halftime report and especially the From the Bleachers section where I can see how others are reacting to what they read. Your responses are usually spot on but [on Tuesday] I took umbrage to your calling the impeachment process ‘festivities’. While politics in general tends to resemble Battlebots and political conventions are certainly festive the gravity of what is taking place in Washington now should be handled with more seriousness. The potential removal of a duly elected president regardless of the outcome will leave wounds on this country that will take a long time to heal. We may not recognize our Republic when all is said and done due to the scars left behind. One can only hope that later generations can learn where we failed to, so that Impeachment, or the threat of it, is not used as a political tool every 4 years and never becomes something resembling a festival.” – Dave Fischer, Memphis, Tenn.



[Ed. note: I know that it’s very tempting to think the worst, Mr. Fischer. It not only seems more dramatic and historic than being optimistic, it also fits into the nation’s dour mood these days. I know it’s also tempting to take umbrage. In fact, umbrage taking has become sort of our new national pastime. The outrage olympics have overtaken our politics in a profound way. And while I do feel bad that you were offended at my jocularity, I am going to continue to decline to take politics so seriously. The issues at stake are too important to hang on every word of politicians. There’s no way around the partisan conflict ahead, but I still tend to think that there’s something better waiting on the other side. I’m grateful for your readership and hope you can stick with us despite my commitment to due flippancy.]



“Some are saying in the Senate trial, assuming the president is impeached, that the president’s attorneys will have the opportunity to subpoena and question anyone. By anyone, they’re suggesting Comey, Strzok, Page, Ohr, Holder, Lynch, Steele, Brennan, Clapper, not to mention Hilary Clinton… quite literally, anyone. It’s difficult to imagine that this is so, but, if it is, well, the country’s in for a tantalizing, and surely painful, show…” – B. A. Street, Colorado Springs, Colo.



[Ed. note: The Senate gets to make up its own trial rules. How long, how many witnesses, in what order, etc. would all be up for grabs if the House impeaches. I think the scenario you describe – weeks of confusing testimony going down alternate narratives, etc. – would be a bipartisan nightmare. Instead, I expect senators would prefer tight, concise presentations.]

Guy Benson [00:00:00] We continue it's the Guy Benson show. Thanks for being here. Guy Benson show dot.com. Joining me now is Congressman Dan Crenshaw a Republican from Texas the 2nd Congressional District in the Lone Star State the Houston area. He's a former Navy SEAL and a repeat guest here on the program we always appreciate having him.

Guy Benson: Hello Congressman.

Rep. Crenshaw: Hey Guy It's great to be with you.

Guy Benson: Let's start with the soundbite today from the president at the White House cut 16 talking about Biden and investigations and foreign countries. This is a triple down. Have a listen.

TRUMP: China should start an investigation into the Biden's because what happened to China. Is just about as bad as what happened with. With. Ukraine. So I would say that president Zelensky if it were me I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Biden's because nobody has any doubt that they weren't crooked. That was a crooked deal 100 present.

Guy Benson: All right Congressman so there's the president. We remember what he said about Russia and hacking in 2016. Here he goes again saying that the Chinese and the Ukrainians should be investigating the Bidens. Your reaction to that is that's something the president ought to be saying.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well what we should be saying is listen the public does have an interest in knowing this.

Rep. Crenshaw: Former Vice President Biden had a serious conflict of interest that he was advocating for this Ukrainian prosecutor fired when he knew the prosecutor was investigating the company that his son was a board member. And there is a public interest in knowing that. And so you know that the president uses very loose language every time he speaks. He's talked about investigating. I'm not sure any of where the illegal on regarding Ukraine. It wasn't illegal according to Ukrainian law. All right. Any legal part of Ukrainian law. What I care about is whether there was legitimate conflict of interest and just on the facts we have it would appear that there was whether that's illegal is another question whether it really warrants a so-called investigation. Is Another question. And it really is a political calculation if they do it. Do we trust someone who so blatantly had a conflict of interest and they recuse themselves that the facts we have or are frankly involved and just getting to the core of the current debate about about Trump's transcripts. I I will say that I will defend the idea that the public does have an interest in knowing about these things it's not out of the ordinary for the future.

Rep. Crenshaw: The current president to be asking about wrongdoing of U.S. officials.I think the public does have an interest in that.

Guy Benson: There is a public interest certainly but do you try to deputize a foreign government to do the digging in the course of practicing U.S. foreign policy when you're the president. Right. I think that's an important distinction about who's doing the digging who's asking whom to do the digging and when it comes to Biden Ukraine. I'm not saying that his hands are clean but it looks like the prosecutor that he was pushing to get fired was in fact extremely corrupt was not investigating Hunter Biden at the time. I just feel like there's there's a lot of assertions being made all over the place. Congressman I'm not saying you I'm just saying all over the place on both sides of the aisle that I'm not sure that we're following the facts necessarily.

Rep. Crenshaw: Perhaps I like I said whether it's illegal or not and it's kind of irrelevant. I think it's obvious that there was a conflict of interest. It would have been appropriate for the vice president to recuse himself on that. Whether you take any more action on that subject after after that is more questionable. But to your point about listen is it ever appropriate to ask another country to investigate some kind of wrongdoing. I'm not so sure I see a problem with that. It depends on what the investigation is about. Is it official wrongdoing by U.S. officials. Yeah I don't think it's inappropriate to be signaling to other countries of which we've done in the past with that forget that just a year ago there was a letter signed to the Ukrainian government by three Democrat senators asking them to investigate. TRUMP So this is this is this is clearly not unprecedented and we didn't raise any issues back then in 2018. So those again and just normal diplomatic affairs isn't actually out of the ordinary. Trump has the ability to make everything seem out of the ordinary by the way he speaks but we do have to pay attention to the substance of what he's actually saying and the precedent that's already set.

Guy Benson: Sure in the context and what exactly he's requesting and is there an explicit quid pro quo. I think people are getting out over their skis as usual in their criticism of him. I just I don't know Congressman I feel like if if you are looking at a president or asking a foreign government to investigate that president's domestic political rival in the context of any conversation about foreign aid I think that's the type of thing that should not be done and should be avoided. I'm not saying it's impeachable I'm not saying it's illegal I just think it's not a correct use of one's public office do you. Do you disagree with that.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah you're making a style of it it's it's a question of style right.

Rep. Crenshaw: It's a question of whether it's appropriate for that phone call.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well it's an extremely important distinction like whether it's illegal and certainly whether it's unprecedent. And I think we have to be we have to be to think coherently about this is if you're asking a foreign government to investigate somebody's personal life because they're your political rival. Well that's a very different thing than saying that hey we have questions about what happened when this person was in office. You don't get it. You don't get a pass just because you're now running against the current president. Right. Imagine if that was the case imagine so you have to do is run against the current political leadership in all your past wrongs would never be questioned as a result because it would be somehow inappropriate to ask another government about that. I think that's crazy. So again like I like I started out with there is a public interest in knowing about about why the vice president was so involved in this one prosecutor in a foreign country when it just so happens that his son that there was a connection with the son. And why why he wasn't recused from that why the State Department wasn't taking lead on that. I think there's real questions there. OK. Trump was asking him to investigate my personal life. Would that be a different story. Right so I distinguish between those factors.

Guy Benson: I am not arguing that Biden is immune here I also think that you can look at something and say that's a misuse of power and not say well that's a crime and let's throw someone out of office. And I think what we've seen and this is where the Democrats start to come into some trouble they many of them have been saying they want to impeach the president since before he even took office. And one of the public faces of that push who has been I think pretty reckless and irresponsible and dishonest all along the path has been the chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the house Adam Schiff. And now there's a move among GOP leadership to have him censured in the house. Where do you stand on the leadership of Chairman Schiff and this censure resolution.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well he clearly one of the most dishonest members of Congress that we know of with what the Russian probe him claiming and evidence that he did not.

Rep. Crenshaw: It's now coming out that he was he was well aware of this whistleblower and the complaints being made before it was made public even though it was planned otherwise. You know his his parody account in an official hearing at a congressional hearing was supposed to act like adults.

Rep. Crenshaw: This man does a Shakespearean parody account of what the actual transcript was between Trump and and Ukrainian president. I mean it's just disgusting behavior. This man is a liar you should not be trusted that he runs a very powerful and important committee that was ever meant to be so politicized. By the way did the intelligence committee was never meant to be in the public eye. The way it is it is supposed to be a bipartisan way to conduct official national security matters in the country.

Rep. Crenshaw: And it is not what he is capable of doing and it's just it's it's sad to see that.

Guy Benson: You know one of your colleagues on the Republican side who I think is a pretty smart and serious person is at Elise Stefanik from New York. She's not someone given to spasms of insane partisanship and she's come out in the last 24 hours and said that Schiff needs to step down as the chairman of that committee I think the chances of that are nil. Pelosi is going to go to bat for her chairman but I almost wonder does that politically speaking almost help the president because Schiff has such a credibility problem if he's out there as the tip of the spear on this impeachment stuff that might not be terribly helpful to the Democrats who want to at least put on a somber serious face as they go down this path.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah I mean that's exactly right. A ton of respect for her. And that's exactly right.

Rep. Crenshaw: She doesn't. She takes a very objective look at people's behavior and policy as I had a do I and now she's calling for that there's some substance to it she's obviously no that committe she deals with this every day and you know should take her at her word. And to your point yeah there's a there's a real credibility problem. OK. Adam Schiff has lied to us for years about about the Russia Collusion Hoax the evidence he had lying to us again you know and again to into your last point prior about you know whether it's wrong or appropriate but not illegal.

Rep. Crenshaw: You know I would I would still push back in this case because we're assuming that there was some quid pro quo but it turns out after we get the transcript there's really no evidence of that. And that's a really important distinction to make. If if there was an obvious political quid pro quo our view on this should change. But the evidence is just not there. And the media narrative seems to be operating on that premise and it's a false premise.

Guy Benson: Congressman last question we have about a minute left. We've seen Elizabeth Warren propose in the last few days taxing speech. Kamala Harris writing to Twitter saying that the president's Twitter feed should be shut down. And of course the ongoing spat with better raw who's out there talking about gun confiscation. I mean first and second amendments I'm a little nervous about this crowd over there.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah they really like the Bill of Rights. I think they've made that very clear and and that's it. If you want to understand who Democrats are they believe in pure democracy in a pure democracy 51 percent the population can can can can club the rest of the 49 percent.

Rep. Crenshaw: They can change what they can tell them what they think what to do what they can own what they can't own what they can say what they can't say. Democrats believe that it's in the name then Democrat Republicans believe.

Guy Benson: Yes and thankfully Congressman we have a republic if we can keep it. Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas. Always a pleasure sir. We gotta go. Taking a break. Back next on THE GUY BENSON show."

Trump to send Pelosi a letter 'daring' her to hold impeachment inquiry vote

The White House will send House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a letter on Friday ""daring"" her to hold a vote on Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Fox News has confirmed. The letter will say the White House won't comply with the Democrats' investigation because Pelosi hasn't codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent a similar letter to Pelosi on Thursday, taking issue with reports that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was limiting Republicans' ability to ask questions during Thursday’s testimony by former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who resigned last week. Pelosi shot back at McCarthy, saying that ""existing rules of the House provide House committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction."" Speaking to ABC's “Good Morning America” Thursday, Pelosi defended Schiff, who was criticized for reading a ""parody"" of President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Congress, stating “He did not make it up.""

Adam Schiff-Ukraine connection comes under scrutiny

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has played a leading role in investigating the Trump-Ukraine scandal, is facing questions about his own connection to a Soviet-born businessman who has raised money for his campaign and whose company has received lucrative defense contracts from Ukraine's government. That man is Igor Pasternak, founder and CEO of Worldwide Aeros Corp., which makes blimps for military and commercial customers, including the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. In 2013, Pasternak hosted a fundraiser in Washington for Schiff, who later came to embrace a strong stance in support of the U.S. sending military aid to Ukraine during its conflict with Russia.

Documents heighten scrutiny on Biden-Ukraine dealings, indicate Hunter Biden may have made ‘millions’

A batch of newly released documents, including court filings as well as notes from interviews conducted by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, raised more questions about how much money former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter made while serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm at the center of the controversy, with one estimate putting the figure in the ""millions."" Among the documents, as Fox News reported Wednesday, are notes from an interview Trump attorney Giuliani conducted with fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin earlier this year, in which he claimed he was told by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey R. Pyatt to back off an investigation involving that firm, Burisma Holdings, and its founder. According to interview notes, Shokin claimed Pyatt -- currently the ambassador to Greece -- told him to handle that investigation “with white gloves.” Shokin said his “investigations stopped out of fear of the United States.” Click here for more on this story.

In other developments in the formal Trump impeachment inquiry: Republican lawmakers who were present at ex-Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker’s closed-door marathon interview before three House committees on Thursday seemed confident it disproved any allegations of a ""quid pro quo"" in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, as sources told Fox News that Volker was worried about the reliability of the Ukrainian prosecutor informing Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Volker did not think Victor Shokin, the prosecutor investigating Ukrainian firm Burisma -- on which Hunter Biden held a board seat -- was reliable when he told Giuliani that he was told to back off of the investigation at then-Vice President Joe Biden's behest, which is why he worried what Giuliani might try to do with Shokin's claims, according to sources familiar with the testimony. Text messages obtained by Fox News showed Volker and other U.S. officials battling internally over whether Trump was engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine as he pressed the country to look into the Biden family, reportedly using $400 million in military aid as leverage during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to induce him to have officials investigate the Bidens.

Chinese woman caught at Mar-a-Lago with malware was apparently asked to target Clintons: docs

A Chinese businesswoman who was convicted of trespassing at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida earlier this year had been urged by her handler to target other famous figures including the Clintons and billionaire businessman Warren Buffett, court documents say. Yujing Zhang, 33, who is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 22, was caught by Secret Service agents with troves of technology embedded with malware and thousands of dollars in cash after she claimed that she was at Trump's prestigious club to attend a “United Nations friendship event” that had apparently been canceled. Her bizarre behavior and backstory led to suspicions that she was a Chinese government spy, but she was not charged with espionage or related crimes.

Zhang apparently purchased a $20,000 travel package from Li Weitian, also known as Charles Lee, who advertised tickets on the Chinese social media site WeChat promising access to events across the U.S. to meet prominent political and business figures. Upon learning that the event at Mar-a-Lago had been canceled, Lee tried to convince Zhang to attend another event on Wall Street in New York City, text messages between the pair released by the South Florida court Thursday revealed. Bill and Hillary Clinton were scheduled to be there. Click here for more on this story.

Environmental protesters spray UK's Treasury building with fake blood, four arrested

British police arrested four members of the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion on Thursday after they used a fire hose to spray the U.K.’s Treasury building with hundreds of gallons of fake blood. The group said it carried out the protest because it wanted to raise awareness of the ""inconsistency between the U.K. government's insistence that the U.K. is a world leader in tackling climate breakdown while pouring vast sums of money into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects,” according to Sky News. Organizers said they sprayed 1,800 liters of red liquid colored with food dye at the Treasury building, yet most of it appeared to have ended up on the street and sidewalk, Sky News reports. At another point, the protesters lost control of the decommissioned fire engine’s hose, it added. Click here for more on this story.

De Niro drops more F-bombs, this time in audio linked to harassment lawsuit

A former employee at Robert De Niro’s production company slammed ""The Irishman"" actor with a federal lawsuit Thursday, claiming he harassed her and discriminated against her for being a woman – then retaliated against her when she told him of her plans to take legal action, according to bombshell court papers. In one example, De Niro allegedly went ballistic on the woman, calling her a “spoiled brat” in an explicit voicemail when she did not answer his phone call, according to the suit. “How dare you f------ disrespect me?,” he said in the voicemail, in which he also told her: “You’re f------ history.” Last Sunday, De Niro startled CNN and its viewers when he used profanity during a live on-air interview.

Earlier this week, a four-engine, propeller-driven Boeing B-17 bomber encountered mechanical trouble and crashed into a maintenance building at Bradley International Airport, killing seven.

""These aircraft are reminders about the greatness of the World War II generation, they are a great part of history. Whether they are safe to fly is another question,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Fox News on Wednesday in Windsor Locks, where the crash occurred. ""And that's the question that we need to ask before people board them for the experience of flying, which is a great experience. But at the same time we need to make sure they are safe, reliable.""

The retired, civilian-registered plane involved in Wednesday's fiery accident was associated with the Collings Foundation, an educational group that brought its Wings of Freedom vintage aircraft display to the airport this week, according to Connecticut officials.

The now vintage bombers – which are 74 feet long, with a wingspan of 104 feet – were used in daylight bombing raids against Germany during the war.

WORLD WAR II-ERA PLANE CRASH VICTIM IDENTIFIED, AIR NATIONAL GUARD CHIEF HAILED FOR RESCUING PASSENGERS

The Collings Foundation said the B-17 that went down in Connecticut was built in 1945, too late to see combat. The same aircraft, however, was also involved in a crash in 1987 at an air show near Pittsburgh that injured several people, according to the group. The bomber was hit by a severe crosswind as it touched down and overshot the runway before plunging down a hill. It was later repaired.

""I am deeply concerned that these vintage aircraft, decades old, some of them having been involved in crashes before, are still flying,"" Blumenthal told Fox News. ""Until we know exactly what caused this crash, a major tragedy, whether it was a defect in the machine or some problem with maintenance or flying. There should be very serious scrutiny over these planes before they're allowed back in the air.""

The Boeing B-17 bomber – also known as a Flying Fortress – is one of the most celebrated Allied planes of World War II and was used to ferry history buffs and aircraft enthusiasts on short flights where they are able to explore the interior. The Collings Foundation had brought several planes to Bradley Airport this week, offering rides on the B-17 for $400. Besides the bomber, the group planned to have two World War II fighter planes and three bombers at the airport through Thursday.

National Transportation Safety Board member Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference on Thursday that the agency has investigated 21 accidents involving World War II-era bombers since 1982, of which there were 23 fatalities reported. Three of those were B-17G's. Those numbers don't include Wednesday's crash.

""We have to look at that as part of our investigation,"" she said in reference to the safety of the bombers at a news conference Thursday.

'A BIG RISK FOR PASSENGERS'

Those who step on board the vintage aircraft may not know or realize the unique risks that come with the planes that were never intended to be used for civilian tour flights, according to Michael Slack a former NASA engineer, a licensed pilot and aviation attorney with Slack Davis Sanger.

""We have a real disconnect between original purpose and the contemporary purpose,"" Slack said Thursday.

Slack, who owns his own World War II-era plane, a North American T-6 Texan trainer, told Fox News that aircraft such as the B-17 face ""significant"" maintenance challenges with the older engine and hydraulic systems not using original manufactured, but fabricated, parts in order to keep flying.

The biggest risk for passengers on such vintage aircraft is a crash-landing or off-airport landing, according to Slack, due to the possibility of post-impact fires because of how the aircraft's fuel tanks are structured and the ""lack of crashworthy design."" The aircraft's older fuel compartment system is not designed for modern standards, which leaves those on board, particularly at risk if there is a rupture that allows the ""volatile"" fuel to disperse, according to Slack.

""Anything that breaches those tanks can result in a very serious fire,"" he told Fox News.

WORLD WAR II-ERA PLANE CRASHES AT BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN CONNECTICUT, 7 REPORTED DEAD

Slack is currently handling a case on behalf of a passenger who sustained serious burns during a Commemorative Air Force C-47 (DC-3) crash in July 2018 in Burnet, Texas. The aircraft – a fixed-wing, propeller-driven airliner from the 1930s and 1940s – veered off the runway and caught fire at Burnet Municipal Airport, injuring many passengers.

""The risk of post-impact fires. It's very real, one of the things that don't get talked about,"" he said.

In Connecticut, Public Safety Commissioner James Rovella said hours after the crash that some of those on board were burned, and “the victims are very difficult to identify.”

The aircraft that crashed Thursday was one of only 10 B-17s actively flying. Slack told Fox News that in the older aircraft, the possibility of retrofitting the tanks would be ""prohibitively expensive"" and would require a custom fuel bladder arrangement that would be a ""significant expenditure"" for groups who fly the aircraft to take on.

Slack said the incident on Thursday has highlighted ""special risk that people are exposed to"" on the bombers that were never intended to be a transport aircraft.

""If you're going to continue to operate these aircraft, operate them with an essential crew and don't take passengers,"" he told Fox News.

'I WOULD HATE TO SEE THESE FLIGHTS STOP'

For those that get to step onboard the vintage aircraft and go along for a flight, the experience is described as ""surreal.""

""It was just an incredible feeling,"" Thomas Touw from San Francisco told Fox News on Thursday.

Touw, who went aboard a roughly 30-minute flight on the same aircraft that crashed Wednesday with a group of 10 people a few years ago while it was on tour in San Diego, said being on the aircraft was a reminder of what military crews went through at the height of the war, flying in an aircraft with a thin aluminum skin. It was an experience he applied to his own time in the Army.

""You don't get a sense of how vulnerable these crews were unless you fly in that aircraft,"" he told Fox News.

CLICK HERE FOR THE NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

Before passengers take flight, Touw said that crews give guests a briefing about the rules. Passengers are then seated against a wall of the aircraft and brace themselves until it it takes off. Once the plane is airborne, passengers are able to wander around the ""compartmented"" interior. For Touw, the highlight was the aircraft's glass nose which he said was ""beautiful.""

""I would hate to see these flights stop,"" he told Fox News. ""It's such an amazing visceral piece of history that you cannot experience in any other way.""

Slack told Fox News that B-17's are typically given a limited airworthiness certification that comes with limitations because it is a converted aircraft. Touw said as long as the Federal Aviation Administration continues to certify the aircraft to fly and they go through a ""rigorous inspection process,"" that others should be able to experience a few minutes of history.

""Tragedies happen,"" he told Fox News. ""It doesn't mean you need to change everything. You just need to look at ways to make it better.""

'VERY WELL TRAINED PILOT'

Connecticut State Police identified the pilot in Wednesday's accident as 75-year-old Ernest ‘Mac’ McCauley, who a retired Collings Foundation Pilot described as having extensive experience.

""I believe he's probably the highest B-17 Pilot out there,"" David Prescott told FOX61, referring to time spent flying the aircraft. ""In addition to being an airline pilot, he was a very, very well trained pilot with a very high degree of safety training on a regular basis.""

Prescott emphasized passengers should not be scared of taking similar flight tours despite what happened this week.

""The Collings Foundation has a very extensive safety program,"" said Prescott. ""They have a maintenance crew that travels with the planes.""

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

The Collings Foundation did not respond to a request for comment by Fox News regarding Blumenthal's comments, but in a statement posted to its website said its flight team is ""fully cooperating with officials to determine the cause of the crash of the B-17 Flying Fortress and will comment further when details become known.""

""Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were on that flight and we will be forever grateful to the heroic efforts of the first responders at Bradley,"" the group said.

The NTSB sent a team of 10 to investigate the cause of the crash. Blumenthal told Fox News on Wednesday officials told him they were going to do a ""full investigation"" and he was going to ""make it my business"" to look into how the vintage aircraft are overseen, whether they are used for sightseeing or tourism. He said that, because of the need for older parts that are ""difficult to find,"" in addition to the complexities in operating the vintage planes, ""stronger oversight"" should be sought.

""They endanger not just people who are passengers, or are flying them, but also bystanders on the ground,"" Blumenthal told Fox News. “If these aircraft continue to be flown, if they are going to avoid being grounded, there needs to be a stronger regiment of scrutiny and oversight for the vintage airplane.”

* Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, which is a very impressive haul, and puts her second only to Bernie Sanders’ $25.3 million quarter. [Update: I added this item after originally publishing the round-up.]

* Reinforcing impressions that Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign sees Joe Biden as a threat, the president’s operation is launching a $1 million ad buy in early primary states, airing a new attack ad peddling a discredited conspiracy theory involving the former vice president and Ukraine.

* Speaking of Biden, the Democratic campaign announced yesterday that it raised $12.5 million in the third quarter. It’s an underwhelming haul, which is roughly half the money Sanders raised over the same three-month period.

* For his part, Biden is moving forward with a $6 million ad buy in the first four states holding 2020 nominating contests.

* At an official White House event in Florida yesterday, Trump discussed 2020 campaign strategy, went after Elizabeth Warren with his “Pocahontas” slur, and labeled Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe.” It served as a reminder that the president obviously has no qualms about blurring the lines of propriety ahead of 2020.

* In an increasingly common dynamic in the GOP, former Rep. Pete Sessions (R) is launching a comeback bid in a new congressional district. Sessions lost last year in Texas’ 32nd district – an area he’d represented for more than two decades – so he’s now moving to Texas’ 17th district, which will be home to an open-seat contest next year.

* A new Washington Post-Schar School poll shows Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) with a 47% approval rating, despite his recent racial controversy. The same poll found Trump with a 39% approval rating in the commonwealth.

* And in Ohio, the latest Emerson poll shows Biden narrowly leading Sanders, 29% to 27%, with Warren not far behind with 21%. Also of note, the survey found each of the Democratic contenders leading Trump in Ohio in hypothetical general election match-ups."

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Bill Hemmer, Verma said President Trump's executive order – which would expand the program's private insurance option – is ""all about demonstrating his vision to protect and secure the Medicare program.""

In the executive order, the Trump administration claims his Medicare plan will:

Provide more plan choices and time with providers

Streamline approval of therapies

Reform link payments with value

Eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse

Reduce regulation

""He's just building on the tremendous success that we've already had with the program,"" she told Hemmer. ""President Trump's Medicare program is putting money back into the pockets of seniors. We've lowered out-of-pocket costs for drugs and for doctors' visits.""

She added that Medicare Advantage rates were announced at historic lows, citing lower Part D premiums and decreases in drug pricing.

Medicare itself remains popular, but 2020 Democratic presidential candidates' calls to enact a single-payer, government-run system for everyone are far more controversial. Speaking to a retirement community in Florida on Thursday, the president said Democrats want to ""raid Medicare to fund the idea of socialism.""

""All of the Democrats' plans would totally devastate our health care plans,"" he exclaimed.

Sanders' ""single-payer"" approach would cover people of any age and would incorporate the Medicare program. Private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option used by about one-third of seniors, would no longer have a role.

Sanders, who underwent a heart procedure this week, has argued that ""Medicare-for-all"" would offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs.

""In all of these versions, whether it's 'Medicare-for-all' or the public option ... what they're talking about is a government takeover of our private health care system stripping 180 million Americans from private coverage and putting them into a government-run program,"" Verma explained.

""Even when people disagree with what I think would be good to happen in the world, I still want to give them a voice — that's what we're here to do,"" Zuckerberg told his employees.

""I would rather have someone get elected even if I disagree with them on everything, which I don’t even think is the case here, than not give them the ability to say what they think.”

""My first year post-graduation, I worked -- it was in a public school system but I worked with the children with disabilities. I did that for a year, and then that summer I actually didn’t have the education courses, so I was on an 'emergency certificate,' it was called.

""I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, 'I don’t think this is going to work out for me,'"" Warren continued.

Warren has repeated the story at campaign appearances throughout the summer, each time repeating the ""principal did what principals did"" line to describe her departure from teaching.

The senator's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to clarify the apparent discrepancy.

This isn't the first time that Warren's past has raised questions about her credibility. She has been widely criticized for identifying herself as a Native American in legal directories before applying to work at Harvard Law School.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren’s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter.

Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

President Trump’s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

Asked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if she reaches the general election, Warren touted her ""grassroots movement"" and highlighted ""that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.""

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel and ads.

""Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,"" Orthman said.

Details of the ""inappropriate behavior"" were not immediately available, but a source told Politico there were no reports of sexual assault.

McDaniel released a statement saying he'd ""separated"" from the campaign, according to Politico.

""I have tremendous respect for my colleagues despite any disagreements we may have had and believe departing at this time is in the best interest of both parties,"" he said. ""I would never intentionally engage in any behavior inconsistent with the campaign or my own values. If others feel that I have, I understand it is important to listen even when you disagree.

McDaniel is a veteran of Democratic campaigns, having previously worked as the field and political director for Sen. Doug Jones' successful bid for the U.S. Senate in a 2017 special election.

Many Republican lawmakers have been wrongfully silent and have even defended Trump in these actions, Stoddard claimed Thursday on ""Special Report.""

Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, said the situation is the latest example of Trump putting lawmakers from his own party in a troubling spot.

She claimed unless there is an outcry within Republican ranks against what Trump has asked of Beijing and Kiev, his presidential successor will be able to play by the new set of rules he purportedly created.

Stoddard added Warren would also be allowed to ask for assistance from foreign governments unless Trump's actions are curtailed by Congress.

On the roster: Trump offers no off-ramps for Republicans - Time Out: Bon appétit, y’all - Warren, Sanders lap Biden in third quarter fundraising - The real reason the chicken crossed the road



TRUMP OFFERS NO OFF-RAMPS FOR REPUBLICANS

The news these days is pretty grim for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.



The central claim of the whistleblower who came forward to authorities was that President Trump was pressuring America’s Ukrainian allies for dirt on Trump’s chief political rival, Joe Biden.



It has not only been proven true, the president is now doing it right out in the open. He’s even added China to the list of foreign powers he wants to provide opposition research on the Democratic front runner.



Worse, newly revealed texts between American diplomats show that senior State Department officials believed that Trump was conditioning U.S. aid to the long-beleaguered former Soviet republic on the provision of anti-Biden goodies.



But in potentially the worst development so far, it is now alleged that Trump’s personal defense attorney was dangling the promise of an official diplomatic visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president in exchange for a public statement from the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his family’s business dealings in Kyiv.



Team Trump is having some success in deflecting attention, discrediting the California Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee (who’s doing a pretty good job of discrediting himself) and bringing increased attention to the younger Biden’s super-swampy business model.



But the damage is already done. Trump has admitted that the central allegations are true. He has been and is using his office for his own political advantage. All presidents do in more innocuous ways — Air Force One as campaign prop, “official” events as rallies, the White House as an extension of the campaign — but dragging diplomats and involving one of the most potentially dangerous parts of the globe is new.



For Trump loyalists who are in the shoot-‘em-on-Fifth-Avenue club, this is not a problem. They agree with the president that his conduct was “perfect.” They are also convinced that Trump’s predecessor did as bad or worse but was protected by the media. But for those who are not acolytes of Trumpism, including the persuadable voters he desperately needs to win back for re-election, this is turning toxic.



Add in news of an increasingly slouchy economy and you have perhaps the worst political run for this administration yet.



That’s not to say that it’s likely that Trump would ever be removed by the Republican-held Senate. The idea that 20 Republican senators would join Democrats in ousting Trump still sounds laughable.



But the president is certainly not helping his cause with a scorched earth strategy that provides no shelter for his less-fanatically-devoted allies.



Trump’s stance is that he did nothing wrong — again “perfect” — and that anyone who says so is part of the cabal trying to drive him from office.



That’s not going to cut it for lawmakers, especially for vulnerable Senate Republicans, as the 2020 election approaches. They need a space in between: Denunciation of dragging other countries into American politics while still saying Trump’s behavior doesn’t merit removal from office.



Bill Clinton’s team in 1998 knew they had to give Democrats a chance to denounce the president’s scuzzy behavior. Those denunciations actually strengthened Clinton’s standing in the Senate and with voters. He was being punished, formally and informally, and so wasn’t getting away with it. It helped turn him into a sympathetic figure.



Trump and his party are right now a long way from anything like that.



THE RULEBOOK: SERIOUS STUFF

“There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than [the executive department]; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 67



TIME OUT: BON APPÉTIT, Y’ALL

Garden&Gun: “Nearly any Southerner who grew up in the country—whether on one acre or ten thousand—has seen the damage feral hogs do, trampling and uprooting crops and native plants alike. Raised in a North Texas cattle-ranching family, Taylor Hall experienced firsthand the destruction—and one potential solution. ‘Some of the cowboys I worked with would kill them for pig roasts, gumbo, and so forth,’ he says. … Hall kicked around California kitchens before returning home to open his own restaurant, Apis, in the hills outside Austin. A must for his menu: wild pig. … Hall compares the meat with beef. ‘It’s a lot darker because it’s an animal that moves around a lot, so there’s more blood in its muscles. And with that, you’re going to get more of that iron-y, metallic flavor.’ At Apis, Hall cures the meat for charcuterie and grinds it to make a traditional, slow-cooked Italian ragù, a.k.a. Sunday gravy.”

WARREN, SANDERS LAP BIDEN IN THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING

Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign said Friday that it raised $24.6 million in the third quarter and has $25.7 million cash on hand, further solidifying her rise to the top tier in the Democratic primary. The haul bests the $19 million Warren raised last quarter but trails progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose third-quarter total of $25.3 million is the biggest one so far from the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Despite neither candidate holding traditional high-dollar fundraisers, Warren and Sanders both significantly outraised former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million) and Sen. Kamala Harris ($11.6 million). Warren’s team was alone among those campaigns to disclose its exact cash on hand. … [Campaign manager Roger] Lau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.”



Dem front-runners’ ages show larger issue for party - Politico: “Bernie Sanders’ hospitalization with a blocked artery this week finally forced the Democratic Party to confront a lingering fact: All three of its presidential front-runners are septuagenarians, and two are older than Donald Trump… For Sanders, the immediate effect of the incident — a blockage requiring two stents — was to sideline the 78-year-old senator until further notice… But the broader implications were also thrust into plain view: In a Democratic primary that was once expected to break along generational lines, a whole crop of younger contenders has fallen so far back that — even with an aging, top-tier contender laid up — it would take an upset for the party to mount a generational argument against Trump next year. Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — the youngest of the three at 70 — are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate’s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit. Instead, it is Sanders’ friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.”



Harris struggles to gain ground in home state - LAT: “When Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid, she counted California as a major asset. … But rather than serving as a foundation, California is exposing the cracks in her troubled campaign. Recent polling shows Harris mired in a distant fourth place, with support from fewer than 1 in 10 of those surveyed. … In part, the poor standing reflects problems that have plagued Harris nationwide: uneven debate performances, a shifting stance on issues and, perhaps above all, the lack of a clear and compelling message. But part of the explanation is California itself. The state is physically immense… It’s also astronomically expensive to advertise, and that makes it exceedingly difficult for a politician — even one elected three times to statewide office like Harris — to become well known, much less revered. In short, as other presidential hopefuls have painfully learned, there is no such thing in California as a home-state advantage.”



Walter Shapiro: Pete Buttigieg’s undeniable allure - New Republic: “Four months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren. With Sanders ailing and Kamala Harris sputtering, Buttigieg has enough money to go the distance (he has raised $44 million in the last six months) and enough polling support to guarantee his place on every debate stage. Whatever happens next, this youthful candidate with a long resume (Harvard, Rhodes Scholar, McKinsey analyst, failed statewide candidate, mayor, and intelligence officer in Afghanistan) has already emerged as the political surprise of 2019. And that raises a new question: Is Buttigieg, who would be four years younger than JFK if he were inaugurated in 2021, ready for the White House?”

THE REAL REASON THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD

Bangor [Maine] Daily News: “It all started around two weeks ago when [Kate] McCormick returned home from a day at Common Ground Fair… ‘I was really tired and I just wanted to go to bed,’ she said. ‘I lifted up the throw pillows [on my bed], and there was an egg under them.’ McCormick said all she could do at the time was laugh, and look for the nearest suspect. In this case, her 7-year-old German Shepherd-Labrador Retriever mix Jake. … Further investigation, however, revealed the culprit. ‘I started walking around my house and found little piles of chicken poo,’ McCormick said. … The next morning … McCormick was able to witness the hen’s antics first hand. ‘I was awake and the back door was open and before I knew it, I could hear a chicken walking up the stairs in my house,’ she said. … The entire process took around 15 minutes, McCormick said, since the chicken took the time to arrange the blankets and pillows into a sort of nest into which she laid the egg.”

Now, former Vice President Joe Biden has been eclipsed by three of his rivals for their party’s 2020 nomination in the crucial race for campaign cash.

Democratic strategists say the ""devastating number"" is a clear warning sign for Biden as he battles to be his party's 2020 standard-bearer.

WARREN, SANDERS, FAR AHEAD OF BIDEN IN DASH FOR CAMPAIGN CASH

Even the candidate acknowledges the deficit.

“We haven't raised what a lot of people have -- we got started way later than everybody else, but we’ve raised, this last quarter, $15 million, in the middle of summer,” Biden said Thursday at a fundraising event in Palo Alto, Calif.

The $15.2 million the former vice president brought in during the July-September third quarter of fundraising was down more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June quarter.

Perhaps more telling is the fact that it is far behind the $25.3 million that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont collected in the past three months, and the $24.6 million that Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised. Warren, the populist senator from Massachusetts, has surged in recent months, in donations and surveys, and is now essentially tied with Biden for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

For the second straight fundraising quarter, Biden was also outraised by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who took in $19.1 million in contributions to his campaign over the past three months.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“This is a devastating number for Joe Biden,” said a Democratic strategist who asked for anonymity in order to speak more freely.

With the kickoff primary and caucus voting just four months away, the strategist emphasized that “this is a time when candidates are supposed to be showing momentum and strength going into the early contests. This number shows that his operation is basically treading water and being left behind by more dynamic campaigns.”

Another Democratic consultant, who also asked to remain anonymous, warned that Biden’s fundraising figures “should raise some serious questions about whether Joe Biden has the chops to raise the money necessary to compete in a general election and whether he can excite the Democratic base that is giving is giving an enormous number of small-dollar contributions to other candidates.”

A longtime friend, adviser and fundraiser for Biden cautioned against reading too much into the third-quarter figures.

“I’m relatively happy with the Biden numbers. Obviously they could always be higher,” said Larry Rasky, who was a senior adviser on Biden’s unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 White House runs.

Rasky said that raising funds wasn’t “the top priority of the campaign” over the past three months, as staffers concentrated on building up grassroots support.

“I think the numbers give them what they need to compete and try and win in February,” he added. “Third quarter numbers are tough historically for candidates and a candidate like Joe who may not have as big a grassroots base as Sanders and Warren. But the number [will] get us there.”

And he predicted a more robust fundraising effort for the already-underway fourth quarter, spotlighting “it feels that way to me already. There’s more intensity as we start the quarter off.”

Biden has spent the better part of the primary season to date fending off attacks not only from President Trump, but from an array of primary rivals eager to take him down a peg. His poll numbers have remained strong in the face of it all, even as Warren's have risen. One question mark for Biden going forward involves his connection to the newly launched Trump impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill.

Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their business dealings in Ukraine. Critics say this amounted to seeking foreign assistance in a U.S. election.

But it's also cast a spotlight on the Bidens. Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned Biden's role pushing for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been looking into corruption at the company (though the prosecutor was viewed by officials in several countries as himself corrupt).

While Biden denies wrongdoing, a recent Monmouth University poll indicated that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure. The survey also spelled trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be reelected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

Biden may soon have some outside help, however, as he battles for the Democratic nomination.

""They were meant to create doubt, lest anybody even think of taking me seriously as a candidate. But I think at this point, just as that smear campaign cast doubt on my credibility, the fact that I’ve been out there, that people have heard me more themselves, people have seen my clips, enough has begun to cast doubt on the credibility of those who have projected onto me such mischaracterization.”

That’s what differentiates Nevada from Iowa and New Hampshire, and why former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., believes it’s crucial for any presidential candidate hoping to reach the White House to campaign in the Silver State.

“The reason I've indicated that it is so important that people come here -- there's no diversity in Iowa and New Hampshire. None. Here we've got what’s like the most of the rest of America,” Reid told Fox News. ""Candidates must realize that Nevada is a diverse state. It's different than Iowa. It's different than New Hampshire. It's a state that's very diverse.""

Many say that although Iowa has long been seen as the first litmus test for presidential candidates ever since Jimmy Carter was able to use it as a springboard that ultimately led him to the presidency in 1977 – it doesn’t represent the microcosm of diversity that is the United States.

Iowa’s population is 85 percent white and New Hampshire is 90 percent, while Nevada is a minority-majority state, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Although Nevada falls in third behind Iowa and New Hampshire in the national voting pecking order, the state represents the first chance for candidates to reach a diverse voter base that could prove to be an important bellwether in determining voter trends.

But the 2020 candidates don't seem to be paying much attention to the state. Top tier Democratic candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have only spent a handful of days in Nevada, compared to dozens in the other two early voting states.

According to Fox News data, Sen. Sanders has spent 10 days in Nevada, the most among the top three polling candidates, compared to 27 days in Iowa. Warren has spent nine days in Nevada, with Biden only visiting five times.

While it's a critical state, Nevada poses a challenge for candidates.

“They've all come here. I’d like to see them more, but I mean you have to understand that it's much easier to go to Iowa, much easier go to New Hampshire,” Reid told Fox News, adding that most of the candidates are from the East which makes it more difficult to get out to Nevada.

But, he noted, “they’re doing a pretty good job.”

Other than being racially and ethnically diverse, Nevada also has a large labor union presence, a critical voting bloc for Democratic candidates. Still, the candidates seem to be overlooking the state to save money -- and because, unlike the first two voter states, politics doesn't have the same fixation in Nevada.

""It really is a question of dollars and cents,” said Patrick Murray, director, Monmouth University Polling Institute. “Turnout is low. There is not a culture around the Nevada caucus like there is in Iowa and New Hampshire in terms of these voters really turning out, really getting engaged in this process early on.”

While Nevada represents a different voter base that is more encompassing of the nation as a whole, Democratic strategist Roger Fisk said if a candidate loses Iowa and New Hampshire the third state won’t matter.

BIDEN IS SPENDING $6 MILLION TO BLANKET EARLY-VOTING STATES WITH TV AND DIGITAL ADS

“If you come in fourth or fifth in Iowa you can maybe spin that and live for another day in New Hampshire, but if you’re coming out of New Hampshire fourth or fifth then you never had to worry about Nevada at all,” Fisk said, calling Iowa the “biggest slingshot in the world” and referencing former President Barack Obama’s 2008 victory that energized his campaign.

Murray agreed.

“They can spend all the resources saying Nevada is going be the place where they really break out, but if they tank in Iowa [and] New Hampshire, it really doesn't matter because they're done at that point,” Murray said.

On the flip side, both Murray and Fisk noted that if there is no clear frontrunner coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, Nevada’s stock gets increasingly more significant – with Fisk adding that it could even “resuscitate” a campaign.

Local politicians said Nevada has more political importance than people realize -- and could make or break a presidential candidate.

Assemblyman William McCurdy II, chair of the Nevada Democratic Party, believes Nevada is that state that will ultimately “decide who the nominee will be” and who is “going to take on Trump in the general.”

“Candidates who have a statewide presence here, who are actually coming here more and more frequently, we see them being very, very strategic and focused on making sure that they're doing the work to turn out voters,” McCurdy II told Fox News.

McCurdy also noted changes to the caucus system to encourage higher voter turnout

“Our caucus is going to be one of the most expansive, accessible and transparent caucuses yet,” he said, adding that people will have the opportunity to vote early with preference cards translated in different languages.

That's an enthusiasm echoed by Reid, who has high expectations for 2020.

“I think 2020 should be really good because there's so much attention focused now. It's not two candidates. It's 10 candidates. And, I think we've had participation here that I didn't expect has been really very, very good. Even some of the so-called minor candidates are coming here all the time hoping they'll get a strike of lightning here sometime.”

Reid said Nevada will also play a critical role in the general election.

Although a September Fox News Poll has Biden leading President Donald Trump by 14 points, followed by Sanders at 8 points and Sen. Warren right at the margin of error, topping Trump by 6 points – Reid warns against ruling out Trump.

“My career goes back to a number of presidents and there's never been anything like Donald Trump. It's created a lot of anxiety in Nevada, the country and around the world … I have always said, 'don't count him out.' Even though he's amoral, he is a person who is always able to have a discussion on his terms,” Reid told Fox News, adding that “people think he's not very smart, I think he's really smart. He may not be well-read. He may not be very academic. But I think he has a sense of how to pick a fight.”"

""I think Trump supporters feel the same way now. They are looked down on, written off, ignored, and they don't like it -- and that's why the Trump base remains solidly behind the president despite impeachment and a barrage of hatred from the media,"" he continued.

Some four in 10 voters have stuck with the president throughout his time in office, explained Varney, challenging the elites to ""peer out from their ivory towers"" to understand the issues that have faced everyday Americans in the last decade -- and he took aim at many of the Obama-era policies.

""Well paid jobs went overseas, especially to China, ObamaCare helped create an army of part-time workers, opioids devastated communities -- which the elites will never visit, [and] millions of illegals challenged the native-born in the workplace.""

""And if anybody objected, well, you're just a racist bigot ... or as Hillary put it, a deplorable,"" said Varney -- referring to the term used by Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign as a derogatory label for Trump supporters.

Contrasting Trump's successes to what he deemed President Barack Obama's failed policies, Varney praised the incumbent for producing a ""flood of jobs.""

""The lowest-paid workers are making the biggest wage gains, our economy is the top performer in the industrial world, and the open border is gradually, being closed. Middle America, working America, is doing well and gets the respect and attention of this president,"" Varney said.

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Despite Trump's accomplishments, explained Varney, the elites are pushing to remove Trump from office and support his impeachment, because he doesn't ""conform to presidential norms.""

Varney also slammed the media for ""writing the impeachment playbook,"" focusing on ""Trump and how bad he is,"" instead of the ""problems and concerns of everyday Americans.""

""They are indeed ignored and dismissed,"" he said.

Trump has doubled down on his call for Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden over his financial ties with the country while his father served during the Obama administration and called on China to do the same regarding their country's involvement with the Bidens.

The Democratic senator from California slammed the president on Twitter Thursday, while also defending Biden's honor.

""Mr. President, telling lies about Joe Biden won't protect you from the truth. Joe has more patriotism in his pinky finger than you'll ever have,"" Harris wrote. ""You violate your oath and undermine American values when you urge foreign nations to do your dirty work. We will hold you accountable.""

WARREN LAUGHS OFF SUGGESTION THAT TWITTER BAN TRUMP AFTER HARRIS' CALL FOR SUSPENSION

The 2020 presidential contender has been on a warpath recently over her call to have the president suspended from Twitter, which began on Monday after Trump attacked the whistleblower who shed a light on his communications with Ukraine.

""The president's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" Harris said on CNN.

110,Morgan Phillips,"President Trump issued a proclamation Friday requiring immigrants applying for U.S. visas to prove they can afford health care.

Applicants will be denied entry into the U.S. unless they have plans to be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to cover the cost, according to the White House.

The measure would take effect Nov. 3 and will apply to applicants for visas from abroad. It will not be applied retroactively to those already in the U.S. It does not affect lawful permanent residents, nor does it apply to asylum seekers, refugees or children. However, it would apply to the spouses and parents of U.S. citizens.

“Hospitals and other providers often administer care to the uninsured without any hope of receiving reimbursement from them,” the White House explained. “The costs associated with this care are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher fees for medical services ... The United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants who come lawfully in search of brighter futures. We must continue that tradition while also addressing the challenges facing our healthcare system, including protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.""

TOP WARREN CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL FIRED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR'

Hospitals have spent more than $35 billion, or an average of $7 million per hospital, on “unreimbursed services” over the last 10 years, according to the White House.

“Beyond imposing higher costs on hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure, uninsured individuals often use emergency rooms to seek remedies for a variety of non-emergency conditions, causing overcrowding and delays for those who truly need emergency services,” the White House added.

Under the proposed rule, the required insurance can be purchased individually or provided by an employer, and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic. Medicaid doesn't count. And an immigrant will not be able to obtain a visa if using ObamaCare subsidies when buying insurance.

BERNIE SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL, DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK

According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration think tank, 57 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance in 2017, compared with 69 percent of U.S.-born, and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage, compared with 36 percent of native-born. The institute also said the uninsured rate for immigrants dropped from 32 percent to 20 percent between 2013 to 2017.

Earlier this year the Trump administration issued a “public charge rule,” which will go into effect Oct. 15, allowing federal officials to deny green cards to applicants deemed likely to rely on government aid. Officials described the rule as a means to protect taxpayers and promote self-sufficiency among those granted permanent residence. Factors to be considered under the “public charge rule” are age, health, financial assets and education.

The White House also directed officials to recover income-based welfare payments from sponsors and proposed a rule requiring verification of immigration status for anyone seeking access to public housing benefits.

The new restrictions came as immigration and health care are at the forefront of the 2020 presidential race. Democratic candidates have repeatedly decried Trump’s strict immigration policies and most have touted ""Medicare-for-All"" or at the very least a public option for health care. Most have even taken it a step further and supported providing health care for undocumented immigrants. Trump mocked Democrats on Twitter who supported the idea at a Democratic primary debate in June.

“All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare,” Trump tweeted. “How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race!”

Trump to send Pelosi a letter 'daring' her to hold impeachment inquiry vote

The White House will send House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a letter on Friday ""daring"" her to hold a vote on Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Fox News has confirmed. The letter will say the White House won't comply with the Democrats' investigation because Pelosi hasn't codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent a similar letter to Pelosi on Thursday, taking issue with reports that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was limiting Republicans' ability to ask questions during Thursday’s testimony by former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who resigned last week. Pelosi shot back at McCarthy, saying that ""existing rules of the House provide House committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction."" Speaking to ABC's “Good Morning America” Thursday, Pelosi defended Schiff, who was criticized for reading a ""parody"" of President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Congress, stating “He did not make it up.""

Adam Schiff-Ukraine connection comes under scrutiny

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has played a leading role in investigating the Trump-Ukraine scandal, is facing questions about his own connection to a Soviet-born businessman who has raised money for his campaign and whose company has received lucrative defense contracts from Ukraine's government. That man is Igor Pasternak, founder and CEO of Worldwide Aeros Corp., which makes blimps for military and commercial customers, including the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. In 2013, Pasternak hosted a fundraiser in Washington for Schiff, who later came to embrace a strong stance in support of the U.S. sending military aid to Ukraine during its conflict with Russia.

Documents heighten scrutiny on Biden-Ukraine dealings, indicate Hunter Biden may have made ‘millions’

A batch of newly released documents, including court filings as well as notes from interviews conducted by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, raised more questions about how much money former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter made while serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm at the center of the controversy, with one estimate putting the figure in the ""millions."" Among the documents, as Fox News reported Wednesday, are notes from an interview Trump attorney Giuliani conducted with fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin earlier this year, in which he claimed he was told by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey R. Pyatt to back off an investigation involving that firm, Burisma Holdings, and its founder. According to interview notes, Shokin claimed Pyatt -- currently the ambassador to Greece -- told him to handle that investigation “with white gloves.” Shokin said his “investigations stopped out of fear of the United States.” Click here for more on this story.

In other developments in the formal Trump impeachment inquiry: Republican lawmakers who were present at ex-Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker’s closed-door marathon interview before three House committees on Thursday seemed confident it disproved any allegations of a ""quid pro quo"" in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, as sources told Fox News that Volker was worried about the reliability of the Ukrainian prosecutor informing Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Volker did not think Victor Shokin, the prosecutor investigating Ukrainian firm Burisma -- on which Hunter Biden held a board seat -- was reliable when he told Giuliani that he was told to back off of the investigation at then-Vice President Joe Biden's behest, which is why he worried what Giuliani might try to do with Shokin's claims, according to sources familiar with the testimony. Text messages obtained by Fox News showed Volker and other U.S. officials battling internally over whether Trump was engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine as he pressed the country to look into the Biden family, reportedly using $400 million in military aid as leverage during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to induce him to have officials investigate the Bidens.

Chinese woman caught at Mar-a-Lago with malware was apparently asked to target Clintons: docs

A Chinese businesswoman who was convicted of trespassing at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida earlier this year had been urged by her handler to target other famous figures including the Clintons and billionaire businessman Warren Buffett, court documents say. Yujing Zhang, 33, who is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 22, was caught by Secret Service agents with troves of technology embedded with malware and thousands of dollars in cash after she claimed that she was at Trump's prestigious club to attend a “United Nations friendship event” that had apparently been canceled. Her bizarre behavior and backstory led to suspicions that she was a Chinese government spy, but she was not charged with espionage or related crimes.

Zhang apparently purchased a $20,000 travel package from Li Weitian, also known as Charles Lee, who advertised tickets on the Chinese social media site WeChat promising access to events across the U.S. to meet prominent political and business figures. Upon learning that the event at Mar-a-Lago had been canceled, Lee tried to convince Zhang to attend another event on Wall Street in New York City, text messages between the pair released by the South Florida court Thursday revealed. Bill and Hillary Clinton were scheduled to be there. Click here for more on this story.

Environmental protesters spray UK's Treasury building with fake blood, four arrested

British police arrested four members of the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion on Thursday after they used a fire hose to spray the U.K.’s Treasury building with hundreds of gallons of fake blood. The group said it carried out the protest because it wanted to raise awareness of the ""inconsistency between the U.K. government's insistence that the U.K. is a world leader in tackling climate breakdown while pouring vast sums of money into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects,” according to Sky News. Organizers said they sprayed 1,800 liters of red liquid colored with food dye at the Treasury building, yet most of it appeared to have ended up on the street and sidewalk, Sky News reports. At another point, the protesters lost control of the decommissioned fire engine’s hose, it added. Click here for more on this story.

Earlier this week, a four-engine, propeller-driven Boeing B-17 bomber encountered mechanical trouble and crashed into a maintenance building at Bradley International Airport, killing seven.

""These aircraft are reminders about the greatness of the World War II generation, they are a great part of history. Whether they are safe to fly is another question,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Fox News on Wednesday in Windsor Locks, where the crash occurred. ""And that's the question that we need to ask before people board them for the experience of flying, which is a great experience. But at the same time we need to make sure they are safe, reliable.""

The retired, civilian-registered plane involved in Wednesday's fiery accident was associated with the Collings Foundation, an educational group that brought its Wings of Freedom vintage aircraft display to the airport this week, according to Connecticut officials.

The now vintage bombers – which are 74 feet long, with a wingspan of 104 feet – were used in daylight bombing raids against Germany during the war.

WORLD WAR II-ERA PLANE CRASH VICTIM IDENTIFIED, AIR NATIONAL GUARD CHIEF HAILED FOR RESCUING PASSENGERS

The Collings Foundation said the B-17 that went down in Connecticut was built in 1945, too late to see combat. The same aircraft, however, was also involved in a crash in 1987 at an air show near Pittsburgh that injured several people, according to the group. The bomber was hit by a severe crosswind as it touched down and overshot the runway before plunging down a hill. It was later repaired.

""I am deeply concerned that these vintage aircraft, decades old, some of them having been involved in crashes before, are still flying,"" Blumenthal told Fox News. ""Until we know exactly what caused this crash, a major tragedy, whether it was a defect in the machine or some problem with maintenance or flying. There should be very serious scrutiny over these planes before they're allowed back in the air.""

The Boeing B-17 bomber – also known as a Flying Fortress – is one of the most celebrated Allied planes of World War II and was used to ferry history buffs and aircraft enthusiasts on short flights where they are able to explore the interior. The Collings Foundation had brought several planes to Bradley Airport this week, offering rides on the B-17 for $400. Besides the bomber, the group planned to have two World War II fighter planes and three bombers at the airport through Thursday.

National Transportation Safety Board member Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference on Thursday that the agency has investigated 21 accidents involving World War II-era bombers since 1982, of which there were 23 fatalities reported. Three of those were B-17G's. Those numbers don't include Wednesday's crash.

""We have to look at that as part of our investigation,"" she said in reference to the safety of the bombers at a news conference Thursday.

'A BIG RISK FOR PASSENGERS'

Those who step on board the vintage aircraft may not know or realize the unique risks that come with the planes that were never intended to be used for civilian tour flights, according to Michael Slack a former NASA engineer, a licensed pilot and aviation attorney with Slack Davis Sanger.

""We have a real disconnect between original purpose and the contemporary purpose,"" Slack said Thursday.

Slack, who owns his own World War II-era plane, a North American T-6 Texan trainer, told Fox News that aircraft such as the B-17 face ""significant"" maintenance challenges with the older engine and hydraulic systems not using original manufactured, but fabricated, parts in order to keep flying.

The biggest risk for passengers on such vintage aircraft is a crash-landing or off-airport landing, according to Slack, due to the possibility of post-impact fires because of how the aircraft's fuel tanks are structured and the ""lack of crashworthy design."" The aircraft's older fuel compartment system is not designed for modern standards, which leaves those on board, particularly at risk if there is a rupture that allows the ""volatile"" fuel to disperse, according to Slack.

""Anything that breaches those tanks can result in a very serious fire,"" he told Fox News.

WORLD WAR II-ERA PLANE CRASHES AT BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN CONNECTICUT, 7 REPORTED DEAD

Slack is currently handling a case on behalf of a passenger who sustained serious burns during a Commemorative Air Force C-47 (DC-3) crash in July 2018 in Burnet, Texas. The aircraft – a fixed-wing, propeller-driven airliner from the 1930s and 1940s – veered off the runway and caught fire at Burnet Municipal Airport, injuring many passengers.

""The risk of post-impact fires. It's very real, one of the things that don't get talked about,"" he said.

In Connecticut, Public Safety Commissioner James Rovella said hours after the crash that some of those on board were burned, and “the victims are very difficult to identify.”

The aircraft that crashed Thursday was one of only 10 B-17s actively flying. Slack told Fox News that in the older aircraft, the possibility of retrofitting the tanks would be ""prohibitively expensive"" and would require a custom fuel bladder arrangement that would be a ""significant expenditure"" for groups who fly the aircraft to take on.

Slack said the incident on Thursday has highlighted ""special risk that people are exposed to"" on the bombers that were never intended to be a transport aircraft.

""If you're going to continue to operate these aircraft, operate them with an essential crew and don't take passengers,"" he told Fox News.

'I WOULD HATE TO SEE THESE FLIGHTS STOP'

For those that get to step onboard the vintage aircraft and go along for a flight, the experience is described as ""surreal.""

""It was just an incredible feeling,"" Thomas Touw from San Francisco told Fox News on Thursday.

Touw, who went aboard a roughly 30-minute flight on the same aircraft that crashed Wednesday with a group of 10 people a few years ago while it was on tour in San Diego, said being on the aircraft was a reminder of what military crews went through at the height of the war, flying in an aircraft with a thin aluminum skin. It was an experience he applied to his own time in the Army.

""You don't get a sense of how vulnerable these crews were unless you fly in that aircraft,"" he told Fox News.

Before passengers take flight, Touw said that crews give guests a briefing about the rules. Passengers are then seated against a wall of the aircraft and brace themselves until it it takes off. Once the plane is airborne, passengers are able to wander around the ""compartmented"" interior. For Touw, the highlight was the aircraft's glass nose which he said was ""beautiful.""

""I would hate to see these flights stop,"" he told Fox News. ""It's such an amazing visceral piece of history that you cannot experience in any other way.""

Slack told Fox News that B-17's are typically given a limited airworthiness certification that comes with limitations because it is a converted aircraft. Touw said as long as the Federal Aviation Administration continues to certify the aircraft to fly and they go through a ""rigorous inspection process,"" that others should be able to experience a few minutes of history.

""Tragedies happen,"" he told Fox News. ""It doesn't mean you need to change everything. You just need to look at ways to make it better.""

'VERY WELL TRAINED PILOT'

Connecticut State Police identified the pilot in Wednesday's accident as 75-year-old Ernest ‘Mac’ McCauley, who a retired Collings Foundation Pilot described as having extensive experience.

""I believe he's probably the highest B-17 Pilot out there,"" David Prescott told FOX61, referring to time spent flying the aircraft. ""In addition to being an airline pilot, he was a very, very well trained pilot with a very high degree of safety training on a regular basis.""

Prescott emphasized passengers should not be scared of taking similar flight tours despite what happened this week.

""The Collings Foundation has a very extensive safety program,"" said Prescott. ""They have a maintenance crew that travels with the planes.""

The Collings Foundation did not respond to a request for comment by Fox News regarding Blumenthal's comments, but in a statement posted to its website said its flight team is ""fully cooperating with officials to determine the cause of the crash of the B-17 Flying Fortress and will comment further when details become known.""

""Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were on that flight and we will be forever grateful to the heroic efforts of the first responders at Bradley,"" the group said.

The NTSB sent a team of 10 to investigate the cause of the crash. Blumenthal told Fox News on Wednesday officials told him they were going to do a ""full investigation"" and he was going to ""make it my business"" to look into how the vintage aircraft are overseen, whether they are used for sightseeing or tourism. He said that, because of the need for older parts that are ""difficult to find,"" in addition to the complexities in operating the vintage planes, ""stronger oversight"" should be sought.

""They endanger not just people who are passengers, or are flying them, but also bystanders on the ground,"" Blumenthal told Fox News. “If these aircraft continue to be flown, if they are going to avoid being grounded, there needs to be a stronger regiment of scrutiny and oversight for the vintage airplane.”

Warren has repeated the story at campaign appearances throughout the summer, each time repeating the ""principal did what principals did"" line to describe her departure from teaching.

The senator's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to clarify the apparent discrepancy.

This isn't the first time that Warren's past has raised questions about her credibility.

Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4).

South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. It is the fourth state to vote in the nomination race and the first with a large African-American population.

The poll, released Sunday, shows Biden with large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38). Since July, his support has grown 9 points among blacks and 13 points among black men.

Warren is ahead among one group -- white voters with a college degree (+5 points), and comes close to Biden among white voters, trailing him by just 4 points.

Sanders is the top pick among voters under age 35, besting Biden by 9 points.

Hillary Clinton beat Sanders by 73-26 percent in the 2016 South Carolina primary.

When asked their second-choice candidate, Warren tops the list with 16 percent. When first and second-choice preferences are combined, it’s Biden at 52 percent, Warren at 28 and Sanders at 23 percent.

“Warren is a distant second even though she more than doubled her support since July -- and she would need to triple her support again to even get within striking distance of winning South Carolina,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. “But she is really in the delegate hunt here. The fact that she is the top second choice candidate puts her in a good position to gain momentum as the field narrows.”

Fifty-eight percent of South Carolina Democratic primary voters prioritize backing a candidate who can beat Donald Trump, up from 52 percent who felt that way in July. That’s twice the number saying supporting a candidate they like is more important (29 percent).

They also prefer a candidate who will build on former President Barack Obama’s legacy over one with a new and different approach (50-41 percent).

Biden dominates among those prioritizing beating Trump (+39 points) and those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy (+41). He has narrower advantages, although still commanding, among those wanting to back their favorite candidate (+15) and preferring a new approach (+16).

Some 83 percent of primary voters are dissatisfied with how things are going in the country today, and 78 percent favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office.

Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41).

The Democratic candidates mostly owe their advantage to women voters and those with a college degree. Trump does best among white men without a degree and white evangelical Christians.

“Wisconsin is a tough nut for Republicans and the president has an uphill climb,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “He needs to reassure rural voters who are spooked by the tariffs while persuading suburban voters to buy into his low tax/pro-growth economic vision.”

Trump won rural voters by 27 points in 2016. They now back him over Biden by only 2 points.

By a 19-point margin Wisconsin voters think tariffs hurt rather than help the economy, and more oppose building a wall along the southern border by 10 points.

Those favoring the wall prefer Trump by 73 points, while those opposed go for Biden by 76.

Voters who say tariffs hurt the economy prefer Biden by a 61-point margin. Those who think tariffs help support Trump by 65.

Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, making him the first Republican to win the state since 1984. Ninety-two percent of Clinton voters back Biden, while 83 percent of Trump voters stick with him.

Currently, 44 percent of Badger State voters approve of the job Trump is doing and 54 percent disapprove.

Views are nearly identical on the direction of the country: 43 percent are satisfied with how things are going vs. 55 percent dissatisfied.

Almost half (48 percent) rate the economy as excellent or good, while slightly more (51 percent) say it is in only fair or poor shape.

Meanwhile, despite many finding Trump’s dealings with the president of Ukraine troubling (33 percent extremely and 12 percent very), a 54 percent majority says there is zero chance something about the situation would cause them to change their mind about Trump.

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached, but not removed, and 45 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (90 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor it (82 percent).

In the race for the Democratic nomination, Biden is the top choice with 28 percent support, followed by Warren at 22 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent.

Pete Buttigieg comes in at 7 percent, Kamala Harris 5 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang get 2 percent apiece. All others receive 1 percent or less.

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

More Sanders supporters strongly back him (75 percent), compared to Warren (61 percent) and Biden supporters (61 percent).

Biden’s strongest groups include moderates, white Catholics and voters without a college degree. Warren does best among college graduates and self-described liberals, and Sanders makes the top three largely because of voters under age 35.

More Warren supporters (64 percent) are extremely interested in the election than Sanders (60 percent) or Biden supporters (51 percent).

Democratic primary voters place far greater importance on beating Trump than voting for their preferred candidate (52-33 percent). They split, however, when it comes to supporting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy vs. one who will take a new and different approach (43-47 percent).

Biden is the top pick among those who want to build on Obama’s legacy and those who prioritize beating Trump.

Democratic primary voters favoring a new approach give roughly equal support to Biden, Warren and Sanders.

CNN's Van Jones, with zero proof, attributed Trump's victory to ""whitelash."" Trump received 57 percent of the white vote, actually a lower percentage of the white vote than the 59 percent received by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate in 2012. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama received a greater percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did four years earlier. Obama also received 95 percent of the black vote.

Stunned, angry and bewildered by Trump's win, some Democrats urged the Electoral College to refuse to certify his victory.

Nearly 70 Democratic lawmakers vowed to boycott Trump's inauguration. Nearly a dozen Democrats refused to attend Trump's first State of the Union address. In explaining his refusal to attend, Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., said, ""This is a presidency that has been built on racism, stupidity and lies, which has already wasted enough of America's time and I will not waste any more of mine.""

Trump's refusal to turn over his tax returns provoked claims of corruption. Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said: ""What's unprecedented is [Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin] refusing to comply with our lawful, Article I request. What's unprecedented is a Justice Department that again sees its role as being bodyguard to the executive and not the rule of law.

Raskin told Vanity Fair last month: ""It is still very much on my mind and the time will come. I don't think of it as an alternative remedy for impeachment. They address different problems. The core of the concern of impeachment is high crimes and misdemeanors committed by the president. The core problem addressed by the 25th Amendment is the mental or physical incapacity of the president.""

Joe Biden's candidacy will be irreparably harmed by all this Ukraine business, increasing the odds that hard-left Elizabeth Warren will win the Democratic nomination.

Then there was the outcry over Trump's payments to former mistresses. About the payments, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said: ""The president is a criminal. ... This criminal must be brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said from ""day one"" Trump committed an impeachable offense for allegedly violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits all persons holding federal office from accepting ""any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."" Last year, Ocasio-Cortez said:

""I think that there are serious grounds in violations of the emoluments clause from day one. I think that is, first and foremost, one of the basic elements and violations.

One can only marvel at how, with a straight face, Democrats call Trump ""racist"" while embracing as ""kingmaker"" the race card-hustling Rev. Al Sharpton and refusing to denounce anti-Semitic Minister Louis Farrakhan.

Of course, for 2 1/2 years, special counsel Robert Mueller investigated allegations of Russian ""collusion,"" and he drilled a dry hole. On the issue of obstruction of justice, he punted.

While Biden and Trump have been at odds long before the former vice president entered the 2020 presidential race, the animosity between the two has heated following the whistleblower complaint that claimed Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, and threatened to withhold military aid if the Ukrainians did not follow through.

TRUMP FIRES BROADSIDE AT 'PILLAGING' BIDENS, CLAIMS UKRAINE PUSH WAS ONLY ABOUT 'CORRUPTION'

Trump has accused Hunter Biden of improper activity related to his business dealings with energy company Burisma Holdings and claimed his father used his office to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma.

The former vice president has acknowledged publicly that he pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin but denied it had any relation to his son’s business dealings in the country. Biden said his actions were in line with pressure from other foreign leaders to fire the prosecutor.

“We weren’t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn’t do the job,” Biden said this past Wednesday of an Obama administration policy supported by other Western governments that viewed Shokin as incompetent or perhaps corrupt.

The U.S. also had support internationally for its opposition to Shokin. Ukrainian officials, including Shokin’s successor, have said since that the Bidens were never implicated in any wrongdoing.

Biden’s “unhinged” comment came amid a challenging weekend for the Trump administration as reports emerged that a second whistleblower – this one with firsthand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky – has spoken to the intelligence community’s inspector general.

The first whistleblower was subjected to criticism from Trump and his supporters based on an apparent lack of direct knowledge of the president’s conversation with Zelensky, as well as what Trump has called an inaccurate description of the call.

The new whistleblower also faced the ire of Trump, who has been even more active on social media over the weekend than normal. Targets of his social-media attacks included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah.

“The first so-called second hand information “Whistleblower” got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info, Trump tweeted. “Meet with Shifty.

Applicants will be denied entry into the U.S. unless they have plans to be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to cover the cost, according to the White House.

The measure would take effect Nov. 3 and will apply to applicants for visas from abroad. It will not be applied retroactively to those already in the U.S. It does not affect lawful permanent residents, nor does it apply to asylum seekers, refugees or children. However, it would apply to the spouses and parents of U.S. citizens.

“Hospitals and other providers often administer care to the uninsured without any hope of receiving reimbursement from them,” the White House explained. “The costs associated with this care are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher fees for medical services ... The United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants who come lawfully in search of brighter futures. We must continue that tradition while also addressing the challenges facing our healthcare system, including protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.""

Hospitals have spent more than $35 billion, or an average of $7 million per hospital, on “unreimbursed services” over the last 10 years, according to the White House.

“Beyond imposing higher costs on hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure, uninsured individuals often use emergency rooms to seek remedies for a variety of non-emergency conditions, causing overcrowding and delays for those who truly need emergency services,” the White House added.

Under the proposed rule, the required insurance can be purchased individually or provided by an employer, and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic. Medicaid doesn't count. And an immigrant will not be able to obtain a visa if using ObamaCare subsidies when buying insurance.

The institute also said the uninsured rate for immigrants dropped from 32 percent to 20 percent between 2013 to 2017.

Earlier this year the Trump administration issued a “public charge rule,” which will go into effect Oct. 15, allowing federal officials to deny green cards to applicants deemed likely to rely on government aid. Officials described the rule as a means to protect taxpayers and promote self-sufficiency among those granted permanent residence. Factors to be considered under the “public charge rule” are age, health, financial assets and education.

The White House also directed officials to recover income-based welfare payments from sponsors and proposed a rule requiring verification of immigration status for anyone seeking access to public housing benefits.

The new restrictions came as immigration and health care are at the forefront of the 2020 presidential race. Democratic candidates have repeatedly decried Trump’s strict immigration policies and most have touted ""Medicare-for-All"" or at the very least a public option for health care. Most have even taken it a step further and supported providing health care for undocumented immigrants. Trump mocked Democrats on Twitter who supported the idea at a Democratic primary debate in June.

“All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare,” Trump tweeted. “How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race!”

Some investors and analysts are growing increasingly concerned about the prospect of democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren taking the White House in 2020.

Any hit to the stock market from a Warren presidency will likely be temporary, RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients on Monday.

Most of the concerns about a Warren presidency stem from the Senator's policy positions on regulating industries such as health care, banking, and energy.

Wall Street is getting worried about the potential impact of an Elizabeth Warren presidency on the stock market.

But RBC Capital Markets says any pain will likely be short-lived.

Much of the concern surrounding a potential Warren presidency stems from the democratic senator's position on regulating industries such as health care, banking, and energy.

According to RBC, while the broader stock market seems expensive, the industries most vulnerable to Warren's policy plans are deeply undervalued.

""Ultimately we think corporate America and US equity investors would learn to adapt to new political leadership, as they always do,"" said Lori Calvasina, the head of US equity strategy, in a note to clients.

""The stock market tends to go up over time, regardless of who occupies the White House.""

RBC also said that if Warren secures the democratic nomination, the risk of her presidency will likely unravel in the market well before election day.

Warren has proposed a broad range of policies including stricter guidelines for Wall Street banks, a ban on fracking, and a dramatic transition away from private health care providers. While Warren's push for increased regulation could pose a threat to some industries, a democratic presidency could also present some positive themes for US equity investors, RBC added.

""The election of a progressive Democrat seems supportive of the already growing popularity of ESG as an investment approach, since issues like climate change and fair pay could be in the spotlight,"" the firm said in a note to clients on Monday.

Dividends could also become more popular as share buybacks typically lose political favor under democrats, RBC added.

* Late Friday afternoon, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign said the Vermonter was hospitalized following a heart attack in Las Vegas last week. There is no reason to believe this will derail the 78-year-old senator’s presidential campaign, though he is now at home recuperating.

* The latest Fox News poll in South Carolina shows Joe Biden with a sizable lead over his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. The results showed the former vice president with 41%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 12% and Bernie Sanders at 10%.

* Fox News yesterday also released its latest poll out of Wisconsin, where Biden leads Warren by a much narrower margin, 28% to 22%, with Sanders not far behind with 18%. The same survey showed each of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination leading Donald Trump in Wisconsin in hypothetical match-ups, with Biden enjoying the largest advantage (nine points) and Warren enjoying the smallest lead over the president (four points).

* The Warren presidential campaign announced late last week that it has fired its national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, after an investigation into “multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior.”

* As of this morning, it appears that Sen. Cory Booker and Tom Steyer have qualified to participate in the Democratic presidential primary debate in November, bringing the new total of participants to seven. In contrast, 12 candidates are slated to appear in next week’s debate.

* Biden wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post, responding to Trump’s offensive against him, and it concluded, “[T]o Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.”

* Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters on Friday that if Warren is elected president, Power isn’t ruling out the possibility of running for her seat.

* And in a curious tweet, later promoted by Donald Trump, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel suggested donor support is most important indicator of the president’s public standing, arguing, “Dollars are the real polls right now.”"

BIDEN STILL SLIDIN’

IBD: “Elizabeth Warren has taken a narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the October IBD/TIPP Poll found. Both candidates continue to lead in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump, though Biden had a more comfortable lead, outside the margin of error. Elizabeth Warren had the support of 27%, with Joe Biden backed by 26% and Bernie Sanders a distant third at 10%. Support for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg climbed to 7% from 5%. No other candidate polled more than 3%. The October IBD/TIPP Poll showed continued momentum for Warren. Last month's poll had shown support for Warren jumping to 24% from 17%. Meanwhile, Biden's support saw further erosion, after slipping to 28% in September from 30% in August. Sanders, whose nomination prospects could suffer after his heart attack last week, saw support fall after registering 12% the prior two months.”



Biden expands lead in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden increases his lead in the Palmetto State, as a growing number of South Carolina Democratic primary voters want a candidate who can defeat President Trump. The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That’s up from a 21-point lead in July. Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4). … Kamala Harris receives 4 percent, down from 12 percent. Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July, also gets 4 percent. Cory Booker (3 percent) and Pete Buttigieg (2 percent) held steady. All others receive 1 percent or less. South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. … Biden [has] large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38).”



Trump trails Dems in Wisconsin - Fox News: “Wisconsin voters are unhappy with how things are going in the country, oppose the border wall, think tariffs hurt the economy, and disapprove of the job President Trump is doing. … Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way. Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.”



Have you tried turning your campaign off, then turning it back on? - NYT: “At campaign events this past week, Ms. [Kamala] Harris debuted a fresh stump speech focused on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, an issue in which her campaign believes she is uniquely suited to lead as a former prosecutor. She began each of the rallies, titled ‘Dude Gotta Go,’ with a lengthy discussion of the president’s purported crimes, and concluded by talking directly about the idea of ‘electability,’ which she described as the ‘elephant’ in the 2020 race, and the fear that the country was not ready to elect a black woman as president. … In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates … while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.”



STEYER STICKING AROUND

Fox Business: “The wealthiest Democrat in the 2020 race, billionaire Tom Steyer, announced Sunday that he qualified for the November debate. Steyer is worth a whopping $1.6 billion. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the runner-up with a net worth of roughly $200 million. ‘Tom is surging because he’s not part of the establishment and his message of ending the corporate takeover of our government is resonating,’ his campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said in a statement. ‘Tom is excited to continue getting out there and meeting with voters all across the country, hearing their stories, and connecting with them personally, and we are thrilled to see him on stage sharing his vision with the full country at the DNC debate in Ohio on October 15th and in November.’”



Sanders takes aim at DNC corporate donors in new plan - Politico: “Bernie Sanders, a longtime critic of the nation’s campaign finance system, is releasing a plan Monday aimed at ending the influence of corporate cash in politics, including at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The Vermont senator pledges to put a stop to all corporate PAC contributions to the convention if he wins the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. AT&T, Facebook, Independence Blue Cross and other companies each gave seven-figure donations to the event’s host committee in 2016. … His proposal also calls for a lifetime lobbying ban on Democratic National Committee chairs and co-chairs, as well as a prohibition on them working for companies that hold federal contracts or are trying to obtain government approval for mergers or other projects.”



Dem race becomes one of uncertainty - WaPo: “Interviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how — or how much — the events will shift the race. But they point to several worrying factors [about Biden, Warren and Sanders]… Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump’s unmatched ability to shift the public’s focus. … The shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire… But for the front-running trio, the events of the last two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IN MIND…

“…it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated…” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 1



TIME OUT: THE COMEBACK OF ‘THE NATION’S RIVER’

Smithsonian: “When George Washington chose to build his Mount Vernon estate along the Potomac River, he declared the then-pristine body of water ‘the nation’s river.’ At the time, even dolphins were a common sight. In fact, as Karin Bruillard at the Washington Post reports, the porpoises were seen as far upriver as Alexandria, Virginia, in the 1840s. But by the 1960s, the river that flows through the nation’s capital had lost its luster. … Now, after almost 50 years of pollution control, clean-up and restoration efforts, researchers have catalogued well over 1,000 bottlenose dolphins living, mating, and even giving birth in the lower reaches of the river. … Over the past four years, researchers from Georgetown University’s Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project have been cataloguing dolphins in the lake-like area where the Potomac joins the Chesapeake Bay, reports Bruillard for the Post. … But the most exciting development came in August, when researchers witnessed a dolphin giving birth in the river.”

PELOSI RIDES TO RESCUE

WaPo: “A Democratic group with close ties to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to spend more than $1 million on ads set to begin airing this week aimed at bolstering a handful of vulnerable House Democrats as the impeachment probe unfolds. The ads from House Majority Forward, examples of which were reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention the word ‘impeachment.’ Instead, they focus solely on the accomplishments of the 11 individual lawmakers targeted in the campaign. … The campaign represents the first tranche of television ads to be aired by a group with close ties to the party establishment. House Majority Forward is an affiliate of House Majority PAC, the largest Democratic super PAC focused solely on House races. The focus on non-impeachment issues is further evidence that Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders are aiming to sell a ‘walk and chew gum’ image for the party — that they can investigate and possibly impeach President Trump while also working to make progress on jobs, health care and other concerns.”



Team Trump sends Pence impeachment Dems districts - Politico: “The White House wants to make vulnerable House Democrats pay for impeachment. Starting this week, Vice President Mike Pence will embark on a national tour of congressional districts represented by Democrats who’ve come out in support of the inquiry. … Each of the districts on Pence's itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he’s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger.”



McConnell uses campaign ad to flex impeachment muscle - Louisville Courier Journal: “Earlier [last] week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to impeach. But in a new campaign ad on Facebook, the Kentucky Republican makes clear that any impeachment attempt will fail as long as he remains in charge of the Senate. ‘Nancy Pelosi's in the clutches of a left wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president,’ McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video. ‘All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.’ … The McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's ‘Ad Library,’ started running the digital ad last week…”



SUPCO BACK IN SESSION

Fox News: “Now, as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to launch its new term Monday, a 5-4 conservative majority could be poised to provide the White House with significant legal and political victories -- or setbacks. Such are the unusual dynamics now percolating from the nation's highest court. The justices' election-year agenda includes cases dealing with Trump's executive power over immigration, along with LGBTQ workplace discrimination, gun rights and abortion regulations. All are teed up to be argued this term, with religious liberty and health-care appeals good bets to be added to the docket. All will likely be decided in a presidential election year. ‘The court will be an issue in 2020 but that's perfectly normal. It was a huge issue in 2016, it helped get President Trump elected,’ said Paul Smith, a Georgetown University law professor who has argued 21 cases before the high court. ‘And it will be so again, precisely because it's become such an important part of our system.’”

AUDIBLE: HABITUAL LINE STEPPER

“We say, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ Okay, you crossed it. So, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ We’re finally at a point where patience is exhausted, reason is exhausted and, quite frankly, the voters are exhausted.” – Tom Rath, a longtime member of the GOP in New Hampshire, explaining the crossroads Republicans are at with the president right now, per the WaPo.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A week ago (give or take a few days), you ran a lead article to the effect that over the months ahead you were going to soberly and impartially report the facts at every turn in the very ‘wine-dy’ (meaning curve-y) road to the 2020 election. Your lead article [Friday] entitled ‘Trump Offers No Off Ramps to Republicans’ strikes me (after the second reading) as anything but consistent with what I understood to be your sober and impartial mission. It seems that your article is strongly slanted against Trump from beginning to end. If I am wrong, can you explain what your ‘Off Ramp’ article would have to say in order to fail your criteria of impartiality, none-emotional, none-judgmental reporting and analysis? I'm genuinely baffled.” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I gather from your sentiments, Mr. Hutchins that you are a political supporter of the president. And I understand that for the president’s supporters these are trying, frustrating, exhausting days. If one agrees with the president that his conduct relating to Joe Biden and Ukraine has been “perfect” then what’s happening now must seem like madness. But to most observers, the president failed in his duty by entwining domestic politics with foreign policy. It’s proving to be quite damaging. Now, I don’t care who believes what. You may think Trump hung the moon or you may think Trump is Old Scratch himself. Not my problem. What I promised you on Sept. 26 was that we would not obsess over minutiae from the day to day battle between the two sides over impeachment: “You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.” I’m not sure how I’m supposed to do that and not talk about what’s happening in the news. The president is getting absolutely smashed over his conduct vis-a-vis Biden. Support for impeachment has jumped hugely. Republicans are in a defensive crouch and every day one of the president’s team seems to make another blunder that makes the situation even worse. It’s a political catastrophe. It may end up actually working out for Trump and the GOP. Democrats are making plenty of errors of their own and this may all blow up in their faces. And if it does, we’ll certainly be talking about it. But right now, the president and his core supporters don’t seem to understand what a pickle he’s put them in — and the huge problems he’s creating for the GOP. Trump had just gotten out of the woods on the Mueller probe and the very next day needlessly put himself in this jackpot. The position that the president has taken — the “perfect” doctrine — does not reflect the political reality for many members of his party. They need to be able to say that they disapprove, like Democrats did a generation ago, but think America should now “move on” from a divisive distraction. It’s none of my business who wins this fight. That’s up to you. But if you’re interested in my abilities as a forecaster and analyst, it will mean hearing things that you don’t always agree with and certainly discussing matters that are bad news for your team. But it will also mean that I will tell it to you straight. That I will be fair-minded. That I will listen and admit when I’m wrong. That I will give you my thoughts without fear or favor. That we will always do our best.]



“Chris, I’ll keep this short and sweet: 1. Where can I find the law that prohibits a candidate from getting ‘dirt’ on his political opponent from a foreign government? 2. Why is it against the law? Don’t I as a constituent have the right to know if a candidate has broken the law regardless of where the act was committed? 3. If you can never investigate a political opponent for deeds done in a foreign country, what’s to keep someone from simply committing all of their illegal acts in a foreign country?” – Meredith Shoemaker, Sugar Land, Texas



[Ed. note: The president mustn’t do such things himself. And he especially mustn’t do them when he would be the direct beneficiary. We have a Justice Department and a Department of State. We have federal police at the FBI. We have all manner of means by which to combat corruption here and abroad. But when it’s about his political opponents, the president must do his best to stay out of it. Doing otherwise diminishes the confidence Americans have in our legal system to provide dispassionate justice. Presidents of both parties have failed this test in the past so we know how real the temptation is. But it’s not something Americans want to become normal. That’s how governments operate in places like Turkey, Russia and China: People in power use that power to stifle their rivals. I know Trump believes the system is rigged against him, but he is still the president and he must find some way to better honor that high vocation or voters will surely throw him out next year.]



“Unforced errors are the worst kind of errors, in sports and everywhere else. I am reminded of Watergate back when President Richard Nixon was running for re-election. No benefit or advantage was gained from the break-in, and Nixon won re-election in a landslide anyway. Here now President Trump is trying to compromise Joe Biden as a candidate with actions that are expected to have substantial negative consequences for the incumbent – and for what? The race for the Democratic nominee is far from over, but Biden seems to be suffering from the ‘Curse of the Early Frontrunner’ and slipping in the polls for many other reasons than those that are being brought to light from any revelations out of The Ukraine. Hindsight, but also no small amount of foresight and experience, suggests that it would have been (and is) best to ‘keep your powder dry’ for whomever is the actual nominee and not waste time and resources going after those who will not be running against you. If Joe Biden is not the eventual Democratic nominee, this may well be one of those unforced errors that may even approach the impact and magnitude of the Watergate disaster. So much for learning from our past mistakes.” – Kent Haldorson, Beaverton, Ore.



[Ed. note: That’s a very interesting take, Mr. Haldorson. I’m going to chew on it for a while. If I write on it, it will be with due credit to you, sir.]

SO FRESH YOU CAN TASTE THE SQUEAK

Fox News: “And we thought mustard ice cream was a stretch. An ice cream vendor in Ecuador is reportedly seeing demand for her new — and arguably strangest — offering. It's made using the flesh of guinea pigs. Guinea pig meat, known as ‘cuy’ in Ecuador, is typically eaten as a savory dish there and in other South American countries, like Peru and Colombia, where it's often grilled and served whole, per NPR. But María del Carmen Pilapaña, who runs a small stall near the capital of Quito, has stumbled upon a completely new preparation — and it is a hit, she tells The Associated Press. … Pilapaña makes the ice cream by cooking down the guinea pig’s meat and making a pate of sorts before blending it with milk or cream, freezing it, and serving it just like she does with her other flavors.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“As I became convinced of the practical and theoretical defects of the social-democratic tendencies of my youth, it was but a short distance to a philosophy of restrained, free-market governance that gave more space and place to the individual and to the civil society that stands between citizen and state.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Oct. 25, 2013.

VARNEY: BERNIE SANDERS' HOSPITALIZATION MAY TIP DEM NOMINATION TO WARREN

Discussing the latest developments on his Fox Nation show, ""My Take,"" Varney said Democrats are scrambling in fear as they begin to realize ""that none of them can beat Donald Trump"" -- and he believes Americans will stick with the president despite an open impeachment investigation.

""For the 2020 Democratic hopefuls, it is in my opinion, a Monday mess,"" Varney said. ""There's mounting anxiety that none of the Democratic candidates can launch a campaign that will beat Donald Trump.""

""Of course,"" Varney continued, ""if you scan the news of the day, you'd think the world turns on impeachment, you'd think the Trump presidency is on its last legs...that's the media's never-ending obsession. Look beneath the screaming headlines, and it's the Democrats' presidential campaigns that are in real trouble.""

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Delving into the Democratic frontrunners, Varney responded to 2020 candidate Joe Biden's recent statement, in which he wrote that he intends to ""beat Trump like a drum"" in 2020.

Biden has had trouble collecting donations recently, Varney said, after he found himself in the middle of the investigation against President Trump over the content of a phone call during which Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

""He is a casualty of the impeachment, he is collateral damage,"" said Varney in an earlier interview.

Varney then turned to Bernie Sanders, who recently took a break from the campaign trail after he ended up in the hospital with heart complications and underwent an emergency procedure to repair a blocked artery, according to his campaign. It was later disclosed that he had suffered a heart attack.

Varney argued that Sanders' hospital visit lends credence to those questioning whether his age will get in the way of securing a spot in the Oval Office.

BERNIE SANDERS HAS STENTS INSERTED AFTER DOCTORS FIND BLOCKAGE

""We wish the Senator well,"" he said, ""but voters have to be a little skeptical that a 78-year-old can return for a year of exhausting campaigning.""

As Senator Elizabeth Warren surges in the polls, Democrats ""who don't buy her far left-leaning policies"" are becoming increasingly alarmed, Varney said.

WARREN FACES NEW QUESTIONS ON CREDIBILITY

""Warren proposes a wealth tax, a lobbying tax, a corporate profits tax, a higher social security tax on the rich, a higher income tax, and a higher tax on gunmakers... Simply put, the calmer voices in the Democratic party understand that Elizabeth Warren is unelectable,"" Varney said.

""The top three all have their troubles and the rest of the pack has failed to break through,"" concluded Varney.

""Wouldn't you think that, with the President under impeachment threat, the candidates trying to succeed him would be powering ahead? They're not,"" he added.

""It's Trump who has raised the most money, it's the Trump base that is united. I'll repeat,"" he continued, ""eight days before the next debate it's a Monday mess for the Democrat hopefuls.""

The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That’s up from a 21-point lead in July.

Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4).

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. It is the fourth state to vote in the nomination race and the first with a large African-American population.

The poll, released Sunday, shows Biden with large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38). Since July, his support has grown 9 points among blacks and 13 points among black men.

Warren is ahead among one group -- white voters with a college degree (+5 points), and comes close to Biden among white voters, trailing him by just 4 points.

Sanders is the top pick among voters under age 35, besting Biden by 9 points.

Hillary Clinton beat Sanders by 73-26 percent in the 2016 South Carolina primary.

When asked their second-choice candidate, Warren tops the list with 16 percent. When first and second-choice preferences are combined, it’s Biden at 52 percent, Warren at 28 and Sanders at 23 percent.

“Warren is a distant second even though she more than doubled her support since July -- and she would need to triple her support again to even get within striking distance of winning South Carolina,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. “But she is really in the delegate hunt here. The fact that she is the top second choice candidate puts her in a good position to gain momentum as the field narrows.”

Fifty-eight percent of South Carolina Democratic primary voters prioritize backing a candidate who can beat Donald Trump, up from 52 percent who felt that way in July. That’s twice the number saying supporting a candidate they like is more important (29 percent).

They also prefer a candidate who will build on former President Barack Obama’s legacy over one with a new and different approach (50-41 percent).

Biden dominates among those prioritizing beating Trump (+39 points) and those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy (+41). He has narrower advantages, although still commanding, among those wanting to back their favorite candidate (+15) and preferring a new approach (+16).

Some 83 percent of primary voters are dissatisfied with how things are going in the country today, and 78 percent favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office.

Conducted September 29-October 2, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 803 South Carolina Democratic primary voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

That gives Democratic candidates the lead in each of the possible 2020 matchups tested in a Fox News Poll of Wisconsin registered voters.

Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way.

Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.

The Democratic candidates mostly owe their advantage to women voters and those with a college degree. Trump does best among white men without a degree and white evangelical Christians.

“Wisconsin is a tough nut for Republicans and the president has an uphill climb,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “He needs to reassure rural voters who are spooked by the tariffs while persuading suburban voters to buy into his low tax/pro-growth economic vision.”

Trump won rural voters by 27 points in 2016. They now back him over Biden by only 2 points.

By a 19-point margin Wisconsin voters think tariffs hurt rather than help the economy, and more oppose building a wall along the southern border by 10 points.

Those favoring the wall prefer Trump by 73 points, while those opposed go for Biden by 76.

Voters who say tariffs hurt the economy prefer Biden by a 61-point margin. Those who think tariffs help support Trump by 65.

Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, making him the first Republican to win the state since 1984. Ninety-two percent of Clinton voters back Biden, while 83 percent of Trump voters stick with him.

Currently, 44 percent of Badger State voters approve of the job Trump is doing and 54 percent disapprove.

Views are nearly identical on the direction of the country: 43 percent are satisfied with how things are going vs. 55 percent dissatisfied.

Almost half (48 percent) rate the economy as excellent or good, while slightly more (51 percent) say it is in only fair or poor shape.

Meanwhile, despite many finding Trump’s dealings with the president of Ukraine troubling (33 percent extremely and 12 percent very), a 54 percent majority says there is zero chance something about the situation would cause them to change their mind about Trump.

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached, but not removed, and 45 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (90 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor it (82 percent).

In the race for the Democratic nomination, Biden is the top choice with 28 percent support, followed by Warren at 22 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent.

Pete Buttigieg comes in at 7 percent, Kamala Harris 5 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang get 2 percent apiece. All others receive 1 percent or less.

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

More Sanders supporters strongly back him (75 percent), compared to Warren (61 percent) and Biden supporters (61 percent).

Biden’s strongest groups include moderates, white Catholics and voters without a college degree. Warren does best among college graduates and self-described liberals, and Sanders makes the top three largely because of voters under age 35.

More Warren supporters (64 percent) are extremely interested in the election than Sanders (60 percent) or Biden supporters (51 percent).

Democratic primary voters place far greater importance on beating Trump than voting for their preferred candidate (52-33 percent). They split, however, when it comes to supporting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy vs. one who will take a new and different approach (43-47 percent).

Biden is the top pick among those who want to build on Obama’s legacy and those who prioritize beating Trump.

Democratic primary voters favoring a new approach give roughly equal support to Biden, Warren and Sanders.

Washington insiders report that Democratic Party officials are also urging the former first lady to enter the race. They see Joe Biden’s campaign in free-fall, with polling and donations dropping, and they are panicked that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren grows more inevitable by the day. Warren, they think, is way too liberal to win a national election. (They are correct.)

Hence, the overtures to Mrs. Obama, the most admired woman in the country, according to Gallup polls. And not only in the U.S.; according to a YouGov survey, Michelle is the most admired woman in the world. Admittedly, for that honor, she displaced actress Angelina Jolie, whom most would not consider presidential material, but even so…

MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS THERE'S 'ZERO CHANCE' SHE'LL RUN FOR PRESIDENT: 'IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME'

It must be tempting for DNC apparatchiks to look for a new Super Candidate. Notwithstanding the unprecedented number of 2020 contenders, the herd has thinned; the leaders today are no lock to beat President Trump.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is struggling. His money-raise in the third quarter was a pitiful $15 million, nearly $10 million behind Elizabeth Warren. In the RealClearPolitics average of polls, Biden’s line trends downward like a stock you don’t want to own. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-6824.html

Joe’s problems mounted (as I predicted) when Democrats jumped into full-impeachment mode. Their focus on Trump’s push to investigate Biden for corruption in Ukraine of course also brought scrutiny to his son Hunter’s lucrative job with Burisma, a local gas company.

That the younger Biden was paid $50,000 per month by a company whose founder had been under investigation for tax evasion and money laundering and that he won that post when his father was the Obama administration’s point person in Ukraine raises reasonable questions. There may have been no wrongdoing, but the episode is an unpleasant reminder that Biden has been a swamp dweller for decades, and swamp mud tends to cling.

Biden’s worst problem, however, is that he has not batted down Trump’s accusations more convincingly. In a recent front-page piece, the New York Times quotes Democrats who bemoan Biden’s response as tepid and worrisome; they see it as evidence he may not be up to the task of confronting Trump on the campaign trail.

David Plouffe, Obama’s former campaign manager, is reportedly “mystified” by Biden’s hesitance, saying the former vice president should “use this moment and become Trump’s opponent.” But, he has not.

Meanwhile, Warren barrels ahead, much to the dismay of moderate Democrats who admire her zeal but worry that with her far-left agenda she cannot win a national election. Warren’s appeal is strong among women, college-educated whites and young people, but she has yet to bring minority voters on board, and she also trails with whites without a college degree. She recently rolled out a lengthy pro-union program aimed at attracting blue-collar workers, but her embrace of “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal has to date not won over that important Democrat cohort.

Hence, the search for a miracle outsider. But would Michelle Obama want to run? And, would she win?

The Obamas are enjoying life in the post-presidential fast lane, frolicking with billionaires and celebrities like Bruce Springsteen, Oprah, David Geffen and Richard Branson, celebrating their new-found freedom on yachts in Tahiti and elsewhere.

They are also celebrating their new-found wealth. Each has reportedly signed book deals worth $60 million, and signed a “high ten-figure” contract to help Netflix produce films. They recently plunked down $15 million for a beachfront home in Martha’s Vineyard; their net worth has been estimated https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-michelle-obama-net-worth-2018-7 to be between at $40 million and $135 million.

Would Michelle give that up? She says no; she has twice declared publicly she would not run. She must know that campaigning against Trump would be ugly, no matter her credentials or popularity.

Past controversies will dog her, like this remark in 2008: “For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country…” Critics will again scrutinize her Princeton thesis; her kids will once more be thrust on the national stage. Running for president is a dirty business.

But there’s a bigger problem awaiting any last-minute entrant into the 2020 race. Bernie Sanders’ supporters are already angry, convinced they were cheated out of victory by the DNC in 2016.

Hillary Clinton blames Bernie (along with scads of other villains) for her 2016 loss, saying he did not campaign hard enough on her behalf. As a result, she claims, some offended Sanders supporters simply stayed home.

The same will be true in 2020 should the party try an end-run – only this time it will be both Sanders’ army and Warren’s fans who will be furious. Combined, those progressives are attracting 41 percent of Democratic primary voters. That large group will be loath to give up their crusade. Sure, Michelle is popular, but will she adopt their favored policies like the Green New Deal or open borders?

Also, it has been clear in recent months that President Obama’s star has faded. Numerous Democrat candidates have been quick to blast his TPP trade deal and even his signature Affordable Care Act, clearly convinced the Obama imprimatur no longer carries much weight with voters. As much as Biden clings to his relationship with the former president, the less it seems to matter.

Maybe that’s because Democrats now concede that the former president demolished their party; under his leadership, Democrats lost 18 governorships and 816 state legislative seats, 12 seats in the U.S. Senate seats and 64 in the House. Obama left the party politically and financially bankrupt.

Because of those Obama-era losses, President Trump has been able to enact tax and regulation reforms, and appoint hundreds of judges and two Associate Justices of the Supreme Court. Do Democrats really want to travel down that road again?

Middle-class incomes surging – thanks to Trump policies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/steve-moore-democrats-are-wrong-middle-class-incomes-surging-thanks-to-trump-policies,"The latest Census Bureau Current Population Survey data now show that middle-class incomes, after adjusting for inflation, have surged by $5,003 since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. Median household income has now reached $65,976 – an all-time high and up more than 8 percent in 2019 dollars under the Trump presidency.

This data was compiled by the statisticians at Sentier Research, an economic research group whose founders have more than 30 years of experience at the Census Bureau in analyzing the monthly income numbers.

I reported last week in the Wall Street Journal that real median family income had soared by $4,146 under Trump through July 2019. The just-released August numbers from Sentier show a huge monthly gain of $857 in income per household.

MIKE HUCKABEE: TRUMP ECONOMY IS DELIVERING HIGHER INCOMES AND RECORD EMPLOYMENT FOR AMERICANS

These numbers contrast sharply with the 16 years prior to Trump’s presidency. In the eight years that George W. Bush was president, median income barely showed any gain, up just $401 thanks to the deep recession of 2008.

In the seven and a half years that Barack Obama was president, and not including the end of the recession, which Obama inherited, incomes inched up by $1,043 (June 2009 – January 2019). This means that in the 16 years before the Trump presidency, incomes rose by about $1,500 while in less than three years middle incomes have risen three times faster.

The contrast is even sharper when measured on a monthy basis. The monthly rise in incomes under Bush was $4. That number was $11 under Obama and $161 under Trump.

These income numbers are PRE-TAX, so they do NOT include the impact of the Trump tax cut. The Heritage Foundation estimates that the average household has saved $1,400 a year on their federal taxes from the 2017 Trump tax cut. This means many working-class families now have a $6,000 higher after-tax, and after-inflation paycheck today.

These surges in income, especially in the last several months, have occurred at exactly the time when many liberal economists and media talking heads were shouting “recession.” In reality middle-class families were enjoying a near-unprecedented income windfall and “the gains in income levels in recent months,” Sentier reports, “have been accelerating.“

These surges in income, especially in the last several months, have occurred at exactly the time when many liberal economists and media talking heads were shouting “recession.”

These higher wage and salary incomes are no doubt related to the very tight labor market, which has given workers new bargaining power to ask for higher pay. Today there are more than seven million unfilled jobs in America – the highest number of surplus jobs in American history.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

These latest income numbers also squarely contradict the claims by Democratic presidential candidates, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who claim that all the gains from the Trump economy have gone to the rich and large corporations. Warren claimed earlier this year that workers had to work ""two or three or four jobs"" just to keep their incomes from falling.

No, this has been one of the biggest middle-class success stories in modern times, and it is a testament to the success of the Trump tax, regulatory and energy policies.

CNN's Van Jones, with zero proof, attributed Trump's victory to ""whitelash."" Trump received 57 percent of the white vote, actually a lower percentage of the white vote than the 59 percent received by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate in 2012. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama received a greater percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did four years earlier. Obama also received 95 percent of the black vote. None dared call it ""blacklash.""

Stunned, angry and bewildered by Trump's win, some Democrats urged the Electoral College to refuse to certify his victory. In a Washington Post op-ed, John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, said, ""The [Obama] administration should brief members of the Electoral College on the extent and manner of Russia's interference in our election before they vote on Dec. 19.""

Nearly 70 Democratic lawmakers vowed to boycott Trump's inauguration. Nearly a dozen Democrats refused to attend Trump's first State of the Union address. In explaining his refusal to attend, Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., said, ""This is a presidency that has been built on racism, stupidity and lies, which has already wasted enough of America's time and I will not waste any more of mine.""

Trump's refusal to turn over his tax returns provoked claims of corruption. Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said: ""What's unprecedented is [Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin] refusing to comply with our lawful, Article I request. What's unprecedented is a Justice Department that again sees its role as being bodyguard to the executive and not the rule of law. What's unprecedented is an entire federal government working in concert to shield a corrupt president from legal accountability.""

There was the bill introduced in April 2017 by Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., with 67 co-sponsors, to determine whether to invoke the 25th Amendment, under which a president can be removed if ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."" Raskin told Vanity Fair last month: ""It is still very much on my mind and the time will come. I don't think of it as an alternative remedy for impeachment. They address different problems. The core of the concern of impeachment is high crimes and misdemeanors committed by the president. The core problem addressed by the 25th Amendment is the mental or physical incapacity of the president.""

Joe Biden's candidacy will be irreparably harmed by all this Ukraine business, increasing the odds that hard-left Elizabeth Warren will win the Democratic nomination.

Then there was the outcry over Trump's payments to former mistresses. About the payments, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said: ""The president is a criminal. ... This criminal must be brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said from ""day one"" Trump committed an impeachable offense for allegedly violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits all persons holding federal office from accepting ""any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."" Last year, Ocasio-Cortez said:

""I think that there are serious grounds in violations of the emoluments clause from day one. I think that is, first and foremost, one of the basic elements and violations. And then, once again, it's hard to predict what's going to happen over the next few months. There are one or more investigations happening.""

In July, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, wanted Trump impeached for his ""racist tweets"" that attacked several Democratic freshman House members known as ""the squad."" Green tweeted: ""[Trump's] racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia can no longer be tolerated or ignored. We must impeach.""

One can only marvel at how, with a straight face, Democrats call Trump ""racist"" while embracing as ""kingmaker"" the race card-hustling Rev. Al Sharpton and refusing to denounce anti-Semitic Minister Louis Farrakhan.

Of course, for 2 1/2 years, special counsel Robert Mueller investigated allegations of Russian ""collusion,"" and he drilled a dry hole. On the issue of obstruction of justice, he punted. Before the Mueller report came out, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif., claimed there was ""direct evidence [of collusion] but ... also abundant circumstantial evidence.""

Speaking at a Service Employees International Union (SEIU) summit, the 2020 presidential primary contender continued his strategy of pushing back against Trump’s allegations and what his campaign has called the president’s “unprecedented abuse of power.”

""Have you ever seen -- rhetorical question -- a president ever so unhinged as this guy is?"" the Democrat asked Sunday.

While Biden and Trump have been at odds long before the former vice president entered the 2020 presidential race, the animosity between the two has heated following the whistleblower complaint that claimed Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, and threatened to withhold military aid if the Ukrainians did not follow through.

TRUMP FIRES BROADSIDE AT 'PILLAGING' BIDENS, CLAIMS UKRAINE PUSH WAS ONLY ABOUT 'CORRUPTION'

Trump has accused Hunter Biden of improper activity related to his business dealings with energy company Burisma Holdings and claimed his father used his office to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma.

The former vice president has acknowledged publicly that he pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin but denied it had any relation to his son’s business dealings in the country. Biden said his actions were in line with pressure from other foreign leaders to fire the prosecutor.

“We weren’t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn’t do the job,” Biden said this past Wednesday of an Obama administration policy supported by other Western governments that viewed Shokin as incompetent or perhaps corrupt.

The U.S. also had support internationally for its opposition to Shokin. Ukrainian officials, including Shokin’s successor, have said since that the Bidens were never implicated in any wrongdoing.

Biden’s “unhinged” comment came amid a challenging weekend for the Trump administration as reports emerged that a second whistleblower – this one with firsthand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky – has spoken to the intelligence community’s inspector general.

The first whistleblower was subjected to criticism from Trump and his supporters based on an apparent lack of direct knowledge of the president’s conversation with Zelensky, as well as what Trump has called an inaccurate description of the call.

The new whistleblower also faced the ire of Trump, who has been even more active on social media over the weekend than normal. Targets of his social-media attacks included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah.

“The first so-called second hand information “Whistleblower” got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info, Trump tweeted. “Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!”

Biden held a nine-point advantage over Trump in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, according to a Fox News poll out Sunday.

Thom Tillis: Dems' strategy of personal destruction against Trump began with Brett Kavanaugh,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-strategy-personal-destruction-trump-kavanaugh-thom-tillis,"Monday, October 7, marks one year since Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. He is already proving to be a brilliant and fair-minded conservative jurist who follows the Constitution as written.

While Kavanaugh will undoubtedly make his lasting mark on the Court in the coming decades, his confirmation process will, unfortunately, go down in history as one of the low points of American politics.

It will be remembered as the moment in which Democrats, starving for a political victory following their stunning defeat to President Trump in 2016, adopted a politics of personal destruction strategy, launching a highly coordinated smear campaign against the president’s judicial nominee.

GREGG JARRETT: THE PELOSI-SCHIFF 'WITCH HUNT' TO IMPEACH TRUMP IS AN ABUSE OF POWER

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was on the frontline throughout the entire confirmation process and was one of Kavanaugh’s staunchest supporters.

It was surreal to see my Democratic colleagues abandon the basic tenants of due process, presuming Kavanaugh guilty until proven innocent.

Encouraged by their fanatical, left-wing base and a pliant media, no allegation was too far-fetched to embrace. They even sunk so low that they hyped up the egregiously false allegations made by the client of con-man lawyer Michael Avenatti. It was a disgrace.

Fortunately, their smear campaign failed. The truth prevailed and Kavanaugh was confirmed.

Fast forward to just a few weeks ago, when Democratic presidential candidates and mainstream media outlets pounced on a completely uncorroborated allegation against Kavanaugh published by The New York Times in the paper’s Opinion section.

The Democrats’ impeachment push is about overturning the results of the 2016 election, covering up their socialist and open borders policies, and destroying President Trump personally and politically to pave their path to victory in 2020.

Democrats like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris rushed to call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. However, the American people soon learned that the authors conveniently left out vital exculpatory facts, forcing the New York Times to issue an editor’s note correcting the story.

While September may have started with Democrats’ aiming their politics of personal destruction and calls for impeachment at Kavanaugh, it ended with them doing the same against President Trump.

We already know more about the facts of President Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart than the so-called “whistleblower” did because we’ve seen the transcript, unlike the individual who filed the complaint. The transcript directly contradicts the Democratic narrative that the president engaged in a “quid pro quo.”

The latest impeachment push is already unfolding in a way that’s eerily similar to the Kavanaugh spectacle, including Democrats knowing about the allegations before they were made public -- giving them time to create their narrative in advance.

This week the public learned that Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and his staff were working with the so-called whistleblower and encouraged him or her to file the complaint.

It’s no surprise that Democrats have already deemed the facts as irrelevant because their end game is removing President Trump from power using any means necessary.

They're not even trying to hide what their motivation is with Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, recently declaring on national television that “I’m concerned if we don’t impeach this president, he will get re-elected.”

That’s exactly why Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for an impeachment inquiry before she even saw the transcript of the president’s call with the Ukrainian leader. And it’s why Schiff tried to deceive the American public by reading a completely fabricated transcript to make the president look bad.

Democrats, including those running against me in North Carolina, are taking a page out of their Kavanaugh playbook by pushing impeachment because it’s the only play they have left.

At the end of the day, Democrats know they can’t beat President Trump on the issues the American people care about.

They know they can’t beat President Trump by attacking his record of generating record economic growth, securing the border, appointing conservative judges, rebuilding our military, making major reforms to the VA and cutting taxes for hardworking Americans.

The only alternative Democrats are offering Americans is a radical liberal agenda that the American people refuse to buy.

They want to eliminate your employer-provided health insurance, increase the taxes on the money you worked hard for and even implement radical policies like the Green New Deal to prevent you from eating hamburgers and driving the cars you to want to drive.

Democrats know they can’t beat President Trump by running on the issues the American people care about, which is why they’ve employed the politics of personal destruction designed to grind the president’s policy initiatives to a halt, even as they admit that doing so will tear the country apart.

Some investors and analysts are growing increasingly concerned about the prospect of democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren taking the White House in 2020.

Any hit to the stock market from a Warren presidency will likely be temporary, RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients on Monday.

Most of the concerns about a Warren presidency stem from the Senator's policy positions on regulating industries such as health care, banking, and energy.

Visit the Markets Insider homepage for more stories.

Wall Street is getting worried about the potential impact of an Elizabeth Warren presidency on the stock market.

But RBC Capital Markets says any pain will likely be short-lived.

Much of the concern surrounding a potential Warren presidency stems from the democratic senator's position on regulating industries such as health care, banking, and energy.

According to RBC, while the broader stock market seems expensive, the industries most vulnerable to Warren's policy plans are deeply undervalued.

""Ultimately we think corporate America and US equity investors would learn to adapt to new political leadership, as they always do,"" said Lori Calvasina, the head of US equity strategy, in a note to clients.

""The stock market tends to go up over time, regardless of who occupies the White House.""

RBC also said that if Warren secures the democratic nomination, the risk of her presidency will likely unravel in the market well before election day.

Warren has proposed a broad range of policies including stricter guidelines for Wall Street banks, a ban on fracking, and a dramatic transition away from private health care providers. While Warren's push for increased regulation could pose a threat to some industries, a democratic presidency could also present some positive themes for US equity investors, RBC added.

""The election of a progressive Democrat seems supportive of the already growing popularity of ESG as an investment approach, since issues like climate change and fair pay could be in the spotlight,"" the firm said in a note to clients on Monday.

Dividends could also become more popular as share buybacks typically lose political favor under democrats, RBC added.

* Late Friday afternoon, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign said the Vermonter was hospitalized following a heart attack in Las Vegas last week. There is no reason to believe this will derail the 78-year-old senator’s presidential campaign, though he is now at home recuperating.

* The latest Fox News poll in South Carolina shows Joe Biden with a sizable lead over his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. The results showed the former vice president with 41%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 12% and Bernie Sanders at 10%.

* Fox News yesterday also released its latest poll out of Wisconsin, where Biden leads Warren by a much narrower margin, 28% to 22%, with Sanders not far behind with 18%. The same survey showed each of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination leading Donald Trump in Wisconsin in hypothetical match-ups, with Biden enjoying the largest advantage (nine points) and Warren enjoying the smallest lead over the president (four points).

* The Warren presidential campaign announced late last week that it has fired its national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, after an investigation into “multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior.”

* As of this morning, it appears that Sen. Cory Booker and Tom Steyer have qualified to participate in the Democratic presidential primary debate in November, bringing the new total of participants to seven. In contrast, 12 candidates are slated to appear in next week’s debate.

* Biden wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post, responding to Trump’s offensive against him, and it concluded, “[T]o Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.”

* Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters on Friday that if Warren is elected president, Power isn’t ruling out the possibility of running for her seat.

* And in a curious tweet, later promoted by Donald Trump, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel suggested donor support is most important indicator of the president’s public standing, arguing, “Dollars are the real polls right now.”"

* With just a few days remaining before Louisiana’s gubernatorial primary, the latest Mason-Dixon poll found incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) leading the pack with 45%, followed by while Eddie Rispone (R) is at 22% and Ralph Abraham (R) is at 17%. In the expected runoff, scheduled November 16, the poll shows Edwards leading Abraham, 53% to 38%.

* With Donald Trump slated to hold a rally in Minneapolis this week, there’s apparently a brewing dispute between the president’s campaign team and local officials over security costs associated with the event. It’s why Trump has spent much of the morning lashing out at Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey via Twitter.

* Speaking of Minnesota, Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s Democratic presidential campaign reported a third-quarter fundraising haul of $4.8 million, which isn’t great, but which is more than enough to meet the threshold for the party’s November primary debate. Klobuchar has not, however, yet met the polling threshold to participate in the event.

* The New York Times had an interesting item the other day on prominent members of the Republican Party’s “Never Trump” contingent who’ve since changed their minds. The article noted Erick Erickson, among others, who vowed, “I will not vote for Donald Trump. Ever,” only to recently change direction.

* With Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) stepping down in a couple of months for health reasons, Republicans are lining up to ask Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to appoint them to the seat. Among the latest is former Rep. Jack Kingston (R), who lost in his Senate bid in 2014, and who last week reminded the governor’s office that he’s “aggressively defended President Trump at every turn” and “spent 30 years taking on the Democrats’ misguided agenda.”

* With only four weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the Democratic Governors Association is running this ad targeting Gov. Matt Bevin (R) for trying to derail the state’s Medicaid-expansion program, which is a story we discussed in some detail a few years ago.

* And in California, the latest Public Policy Institute of California poll found Elizabeth Warren narrowly leading Joe Biden, 23% to 22%, with Bernie Sanders right behind them with 21%. Kamala Harris is still running fourth in her home state with 8% support in the poll."

Elizabeth Warren proved she's ""more Native American than capitalist"" and is seeking to fundamentally change America's financial system for the worse, said former CKE Restaurants CEO Andy Puzder on ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday.

Puzder was responding to Warren's letter to J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, urging him and other financial leaders to support her 2020 campaign agenda.

""I expect that you will endorse and wholeheartedly support the reforms laid out in the Accountable Capitalism Act,"" she wrote.

WARREN ACCUSES LARGE U.S. COMPANIES OF BEING DISLOYAL TO AMERICANS IN NEW CAMPAIGN AD, CALLS HER PAN 'ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM'

""I don't know what view [Warren] has of capitalism,"" Puzder said. ""She claims she's a capitalist to the core -- I think she's more Native American than she is capitalist. I mean, this letter is ridiculous. She writes it like she's the premier of China, ordering corporations in China to do X or to do Y.""

Puzder claimed Warren's platform attacks the very foundation of business and free enterprise that drives wealth in the United States and said everyday Americans will see their 401(k)'s take a hit if she assumes office.

""She attacks corporate profits, which is how businesses stay in business -- it's how they make money [so] that they can pay dividends,"" he said. ""She then attacks dividends which is how corporations get money out, not only to individuals or corporate executives... but also to 401(k) plans and pension plans.

""If pension plans -- if their dividends are cut, they're not going to be able to meet their obligations to retirees,"" Puzder continued. ""The entire letter she wrote to Jamie Dimon was an embarrassment. I hope people actually read it.""

Puzder also said Warren's policies would ironically widen the wealth gap and stifle economic growth, all in the name of redistribution of wealth.

""People's wages are up, there are more people working than have ever worked in the history of this country. They're making more money. They're taking home more money because of the tax cuts, and income inequality is shrinking. So what she wants to do would hurt the economy, it would hurt workers, it would increase income inequality. It would do all of the things that she says she's opposed to."""

In Warren’s 2017 book, “This Fight is Our Fight,” she recalls that her mother’s temper boiled over during an argument about the high cost of attending college.

“Quick as lightning, she hit me hard in the face,” the Democratic senator from Massachusetts wrote.

WARREN STANDS BY CLAIM SCHOOL FORCED HER OUT OF TEACHING JOB DUE TO PREGNANCY

But the incident -- and Warren’s memory of her mother’s aggression -- are missing from a very similar story about going away to college in an earlier book called “A Fighting Chance.”

“My mother kept saying no, but then Daddy surprised both of us, saying: ‘Let her try, Polly,’” Warren wrote in the 2014 book.

This description of her mother, Polly Herring, as ultimately supportive, instead of physically forceful, is consistent with an even earlier book, “The Two Income Trap.”

“When I was a senior in high school, she talked about quitting, but she decided to keep working so that she and my father could help with the cost of my college tuition,” Warren wrote in 2003.

As a presidential candidate, Warren often weaves stories about her own struggles as a student into proposals for things like tuition-free college and student loan debt cancellation.

But recently discovered discrepancies raise new questions about the accuracy of her stories on the stump.

The Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News about why her descriptions about the same set of conversations about college are so different.

But Warren did explain her approach to sharing her biography in an attempt to clarify a similar story, about her claims that she was passed over for a teaching job in her twenties because she was pregnant, despite newly-uncovered records suggesting otherwise.

“After becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them,” Warren told CBS News.

Most famously when it comes to her biography, Warren has repeatedly faced questions throughout her political career about her past claims of Native American ancestry. She doesn't identify that way anymore and has faced accusations from Republicans that she once did so to advance her academic career."

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Sandra Smith, Pavlich predicted that Warren will increasingly face scrutiny for her ""pattern"" of autobiographical stories that just don't add up.

On Tuesday, Warren -- who in recent weeks has been surging in the polls -- attempted to clarify another personal story that has been called into question. She has repeatedly claimed that in 1971, she was fired from a teaching job because she was ""visibly pregnant."" The dismissal has been presented as a turning point for Warren that propelled her toward a Harvard Law professorship and a career in politics.

However, Warren said in a 2007 interview that she left the job after realizing that the education courses that she needed to take weren’t working out for her.

VIDEO APPEARS TO CONTRADICT WARREN'S SUGGESTION THAT SCHOOL FIRED HER OVER PREGNANCY

""I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, 'I don't think this is going to work out for me.' I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years and I was really casting about, thinking, 'What am I going to do?'"" she said.

""Elizabeth Warren's team is saying that her contract was renewed when she was only four months pregnant and not showing that she was pregnant,"" Pavlich noted. ""They're not denying and they're not clarifying this discrepancy between the two stories.""

""And, it really comes and brings into light Elizabeth Warren's pattern now of telling stories that don't necessarily add up about her background and her efforts to turn herself into a victim in some ways,"" she told Smith. ""As she goes for that frontrunner status against Joe Biden, she's certainly going to face a lot more scrutiny about her claims of victimhood that she's using in her campaign stump speeches on the campaign trail.""

On Monday, The Washington Free Beacon located records from the local school board. Those records showed that the board in April 1971 voted to extend Warren a second-year contract similar to the one she held the previous year.

WARREN FACES MOUNTING QUESTIONS ON ANOTHER PART OF HER PERSONAL STORY: WAS SHE FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT?

That June, the board's minutes show that Warren's resignation was “accepted with regret.”

On Tuesday, Warren repeated her claim that she was pushed out, indicating that while the contract was extended in April when her pregnancy was not visible, that changed a few months later.

In an interview with CBS, Warren also stood by her claim of being ""shown the door"" by the principal.

""When someone calls you in and says the job that you've been hired for the next year is no longer yours, 'we're giving it to someone else,' I think that's being shown the door,"" she said.

""We are in the age of authenticity,"" said Pavlich, ""and Elizabeth Warren has had a really hard time maintaining her authenticity through these stories she keeps telling about discrimination against herself.

""When in fact, she's using these things like the story of her alleged mistreatment or discrimination because she was pregnant - even though the documents show otherwise,"" she added, ""to get ahead in the polls, to try and relate to women, to build policy platforms, to argue that women are maybe still discriminated against in the workplace because they are pregnant.""

Elizabeth Warren is holding a slight edge over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for their party’s 2020 nomination.

The poll – released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University – is the latest in a slew of national and early voting state surveys in recent weeks to show Warren has surged and now is virtually tied with Biden in the Democratic primary battle.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

The populist senator from Massachusetts who has produced one progressive plan after another stands at 29 percent support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the survey. Biden – who for months was the unrivaled front-runner – registers at 26 percent. Warren’s three-point advantage over the former vice president is within the poll’s margin of error.

“Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders – the progressive independent from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – received 16 percent support.

Warren was at 27 percent, Biden 25 percent, and Sanders 16 percent in Quinnipiac's last Democratic primary poll, which was released two weeks ago.

QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER WARREN'S STUMP SPEECH STORY THAT SHE LOST HER TEACHING JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a distant fourth, at 4 percent, in the new survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang stand at 3 percent in the survey. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota register at 2 percent, with everyone one else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates coming in at 1 percent or less.

Biden tops President Trump 51-40 percent in a hypothetical general election matchup. But that’s down from a 16 percentage point lead over the GOP president in Quinnipiac’s late August poll. Warren’s ahead of Trump by eight points in the new survey, down from a 12-point lead in August. And Sanders beat the president by 7 points, down from a 14 point lead in the previous poll.

The new poll also indicates that registered voters nationwide remain divided over impeaching and removing the president from office over the Ukrainian crisis.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY GETS MAJORITY SUPPORT IN NEW POLL

Forty-five percent of registered voters say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 49 percent opposing such a move. Voters were evenly split at 47 percent in last week’s Quinnipiac survey. But a Quinnipiac poll released late last month – before news of the Ukrainian crisis broke – indicated support for impeachment at just 37 percent.

The new poll indicates 53-43 percent majority support for impeachment inquiry being conducted the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, a slight uptick from 52-45 percent backing for the investigation a week ago.

As expected, there’s a vast partisan divide, with 92 percent of Democrats saying the inquiry’s legitimate and 88 percent of Republicans calling it a witch hunt. By a 52-40 percent margin, independents say the investigation into Trump is legitimate.

Trump’s under fire over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country that’s been battling Russia this decade. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a read-out of the call released by the White House, Democrats argue the president was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

The president and allies have instead tried to put the spotlight in the scandal on Biden, a political rival who’s hoping to face off against the president in next year’s election.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 4-7, with 1,483 self-identified registered voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percent for questions to the 646 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents."

BIDEN STILL SLIDIN’

IBD: “Elizabeth Warren has taken a narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the October IBD/TIPP Poll found. Both candidates continue to lead in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump, though Biden had a more comfortable lead, outside the margin of error. Elizabeth Warren had the support of 27%, with Joe Biden backed by 26% and Bernie Sanders a distant third at 10%. Support for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg climbed to 7% from 5%. No other candidate polled more than 3%. The October IBD/TIPP Poll showed continued momentum for Warren. Last month's poll had shown support for Warren jumping to 24% from 17%. Meanwhile, Biden's support saw further erosion, after slipping to 28% in September from 30% in August. Sanders, whose nomination prospects could suffer after his heart attack last week, saw support fall after registering 12% the prior two months.”



Biden expands lead in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden increases his lead in the Palmetto State, as a growing number of South Carolina Democratic primary voters want a candidate who can defeat President Trump. The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That’s up from a 21-point lead in July. Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4). … Kamala Harris receives 4 percent, down from 12 percent. Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July, also gets 4 percent. Cory Booker (3 percent) and Pete Buttigieg (2 percent) held steady. All others receive 1 percent or less. South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. … Biden [has] large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38).”



Trump trails Dems in Wisconsin - Fox News: “Wisconsin voters are unhappy with how things are going in the country, oppose the border wall, think tariffs hurt the economy, and disapprove of the job President Trump is doing. … Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way. Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.”



Have you tried turning your campaign off, then turning it back on? - NYT: “At campaign events this past week, Ms. [Kamala] Harris debuted a fresh stump speech focused on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, an issue in which her campaign believes she is uniquely suited to lead as a former prosecutor. She began each of the rallies, titled ‘Dude Gotta Go,’ with a lengthy discussion of the president’s purported crimes, and concluded by talking directly about the idea of ‘electability,’ which she described as the ‘elephant’ in the 2020 race, and the fear that the country was not ready to elect a black woman as president. … In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates … while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.”



STEYER STICKING AROUND

Fox Business: “The wealthiest Democrat in the 2020 race, billionaire Tom Steyer, announced Sunday that he qualified for the November debate. Steyer is worth a whopping $1.6 billion. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the runner-up with a net worth of roughly $200 million. ‘Tom is surging because he’s not part of the establishment and his message of ending the corporate takeover of our government is resonating,’ his campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said in a statement. ‘Tom is excited to continue getting out there and meeting with voters all across the country, hearing their stories, and connecting with them personally, and we are thrilled to see him on stage sharing his vision with the full country at the DNC debate in Ohio on October 15th and in November.’”



Sanders takes aim at DNC corporate donors in new plan - Politico: “Bernie Sanders, a longtime critic of the nation’s campaign finance system, is releasing a plan Monday aimed at ending the influence of corporate cash in politics, including at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The Vermont senator pledges to put a stop to all corporate PAC contributions to the convention if he wins the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. AT&T, Facebook, Independence Blue Cross and other companies each gave seven-figure donations to the event’s host committee in 2016. … His proposal also calls for a lifetime lobbying ban on Democratic National Committee chairs and co-chairs, as well as a prohibition on them working for companies that hold federal contracts or are trying to obtain government approval for mergers or other projects.”



Dem race becomes one of uncertainty - WaPo: “Interviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how — or how much — the events will shift the race. But they point to several worrying factors [about Biden, Warren and Sanders]… Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump’s unmatched ability to shift the public’s focus. … The shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire… But for the front-running trio, the events of the last two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IN MIND…

“…it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated…” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 1



TIME OUT: THE COMEBACK OF ‘THE NATION’S RIVER’

Smithsonian: “When George Washington chose to build his Mount Vernon estate along the Potomac River, he declared the then-pristine body of water ‘the nation’s river.’ At the time, even dolphins were a common sight. In fact, as Karin Bruillard at the Washington Post reports, the porpoises were seen as far upriver as Alexandria, Virginia, in the 1840s. But by the 1960s, the river that flows through the nation’s capital had lost its luster. … Now, after almost 50 years of pollution control, clean-up and restoration efforts, researchers have catalogued well over 1,000 bottlenose dolphins living, mating, and even giving birth in the lower reaches of the river. … Over the past four years, researchers from Georgetown University’s Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project have been cataloguing dolphins in the lake-like area where the Potomac joins the Chesapeake Bay, reports Bruillard for the Post. … But the most exciting development came in August, when researchers witnessed a dolphin giving birth in the river.”

PELOSI RIDES TO RESCUE

WaPo: “A Democratic group with close ties to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to spend more than $1 million on ads set to begin airing this week aimed at bolstering a handful of vulnerable House Democrats as the impeachment probe unfolds. The ads from House Majority Forward, examples of which were reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention the word ‘impeachment.’ Instead, they focus solely on the accomplishments of the 11 individual lawmakers targeted in the campaign. … The campaign represents the first tranche of television ads to be aired by a group with close ties to the party establishment. House Majority Forward is an affiliate of House Majority PAC, the largest Democratic super PAC focused solely on House races. The focus on non-impeachment issues is further evidence that Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders are aiming to sell a ‘walk and chew gum’ image for the party — that they can investigate and possibly impeach President Trump while also working to make progress on jobs, health care and other concerns.”



Team Trump sends Pence impeachment Dems districts - Politico: “The White House wants to make vulnerable House Democrats pay for impeachment. Starting this week, Vice President Mike Pence will embark on a national tour of congressional districts represented by Democrats who’ve come out in support of the inquiry. … Each of the districts on Pence's itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he’s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger.”



McConnell uses campaign ad to flex impeachment muscle - Louisville Courier Journal: “Earlier [last] week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to impeach. But in a new campaign ad on Facebook, the Kentucky Republican makes clear that any impeachment attempt will fail as long as he remains in charge of the Senate. ‘Nancy Pelosi's in the clutches of a left wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president,’ McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video. ‘All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.’ … The McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's ‘Ad Library,’ started running the digital ad last week…”



SUPCO BACK IN SESSION

Fox News: “Now, as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to launch its new term Monday, a 5-4 conservative majority could be poised to provide the White House with significant legal and political victories -- or setbacks. Such are the unusual dynamics now percolating from the nation's highest court. The justices' election-year agenda includes cases dealing with Trump's executive power over immigration, along with LGBTQ workplace discrimination, gun rights and abortion regulations. All are teed up to be argued this term, with religious liberty and health-care appeals good bets to be added to the docket. All will likely be decided in a presidential election year. ‘The court will be an issue in 2020 but that's perfectly normal. It was a huge issue in 2016, it helped get President Trump elected,’ said Paul Smith, a Georgetown University law professor who has argued 21 cases before the high court. ‘And it will be so again, precisely because it's become such an important part of our system.’”

AUDIBLE: HABITUAL LINE STEPPER

“We say, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ Okay, you crossed it. So, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ We’re finally at a point where patience is exhausted, reason is exhausted and, quite frankly, the voters are exhausted.” – Tom Rath, a longtime member of the GOP in New Hampshire, explaining the crossroads Republicans are at with the president right now, per the WaPo.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A week ago (give or take a few days), you ran a lead article to the effect that over the months ahead you were going to soberly and impartially report the facts at every turn in the very ‘wine-dy’ (meaning curve-y) road to the 2020 election. Your lead article [Friday] entitled ‘Trump Offers No Off Ramps to Republicans’ strikes me (after the second reading) as anything but consistent with what I understood to be your sober and impartial mission. It seems that your article is strongly slanted against Trump from beginning to end. If I am wrong, can you explain what your ‘Off Ramp’ article would have to say in order to fail your criteria of impartiality, none-emotional, none-judgmental reporting and analysis? I'm genuinely baffled.” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I gather from your sentiments, Mr. Hutchins that you are a political supporter of the president. And I understand that for the president’s supporters these are trying, frustrating, exhausting days. If one agrees with the president that his conduct relating to Joe Biden and Ukraine has been “perfect” then what’s happening now must seem like madness. But to most observers, the president failed in his duty by entwining domestic politics with foreign policy. It’s proving to be quite damaging. Now, I don’t care who believes what. You may think Trump hung the moon or you may think Trump is Old Scratch himself. Not my problem. What I promised you on Sept. 26 was that we would not obsess over minutiae from the day to day battle between the two sides over impeachment: “You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.” I’m not sure how I’m supposed to do that and not talk about what’s happening in the news. The president is getting absolutely smashed over his conduct vis-a-vis Biden. Support for impeachment has jumped hugely. Republicans are in a defensive crouch and every day one of the president’s team seems to make another blunder that makes the situation even worse. It’s a political catastrophe. It may end up actually working out for Trump and the GOP. Democrats are making plenty of errors of their own and this may all blow up in their faces. And if it does, we’ll certainly be talking about it. But right now, the president and his core supporters don’t seem to understand what a pickle he’s put them in — and the huge problems he’s creating for the GOP. Trump had just gotten out of the woods on the Mueller probe and the very next day needlessly put himself in this jackpot. The position that the president has taken — the “perfect” doctrine — does not reflect the political reality for many members of his party. They need to be able to say that they disapprove, like Democrats did a generation ago, but think America should now “move on” from a divisive distraction. It’s none of my business who wins this fight. That’s up to you. But if you’re interested in my abilities as a forecaster and analyst, it will mean hearing things that you don’t always agree with and certainly discussing matters that are bad news for your team. But it will also mean that I will tell it to you straight. That I will be fair-minded. That I will listen and admit when I’m wrong. That I will give you my thoughts without fear or favor. That we will always do our best.]



“Chris, I’ll keep this short and sweet: 1. Where can I find the law that prohibits a candidate from getting ‘dirt’ on his political opponent from a foreign government? 2. Why is it against the law? Don’t I as a constituent have the right to know if a candidate has broken the law regardless of where the act was committed? 3. If you can never investigate a political opponent for deeds done in a foreign country, what’s to keep someone from simply committing all of their illegal acts in a foreign country?” – Meredith Shoemaker, Sugar Land, Texas



[Ed. note: The president mustn’t do such things himself. And he especially mustn’t do them when he would be the direct beneficiary. We have a Justice Department and a Department of State. We have federal police at the FBI. We have all manner of means by which to combat corruption here and abroad. But when it’s about his political opponents, the president must do his best to stay out of it. Doing otherwise diminishes the confidence Americans have in our legal system to provide dispassionate justice. Presidents of both parties have failed this test in the past so we know how real the temptation is. But it’s not something Americans want to become normal. That’s how governments operate in places like Turkey, Russia and China: People in power use that power to stifle their rivals. I know Trump believes the system is rigged against him, but he is still the president and he must find some way to better honor that high vocation or voters will surely throw him out next year.]



“Unforced errors are the worst kind of errors, in sports and everywhere else. I am reminded of Watergate back when President Richard Nixon was running for re-election. No benefit or advantage was gained from the break-in, and Nixon won re-election in a landslide anyway. Here now President Trump is trying to compromise Joe Biden as a candidate with actions that are expected to have substantial negative consequences for the incumbent – and for what? The race for the Democratic nominee is far from over, but Biden seems to be suffering from the ‘Curse of the Early Frontrunner’ and slipping in the polls for many other reasons than those that are being brought to light from any revelations out of The Ukraine. Hindsight, but also no small amount of foresight and experience, suggests that it would have been (and is) best to ‘keep your powder dry’ for whomever is the actual nominee and not waste time and resources going after those who will not be running against you. If Joe Biden is not the eventual Democratic nominee, this may well be one of those unforced errors that may even approach the impact and magnitude of the Watergate disaster. So much for learning from our past mistakes.” – Kent Haldorson, Beaverton, Ore.



[Ed. note: That’s a very interesting take, Mr. Haldorson. I’m going to chew on it for a while. If I write on it, it will be with due credit to you, sir.]

SO FRESH YOU CAN TASTE THE SQUEAK

Fox News: “And we thought mustard ice cream was a stretch. An ice cream vendor in Ecuador is reportedly seeing demand for her new — and arguably strangest — offering. It's made using the flesh of guinea pigs. Guinea pig meat, known as ‘cuy’ in Ecuador, is typically eaten as a savory dish there and in other South American countries, like Peru and Colombia, where it's often grilled and served whole, per NPR. But María del Carmen Pilapaña, who runs a small stall near the capital of Quito, has stumbled upon a completely new preparation — and it is a hit, she tells The Associated Press. … Pilapaña makes the ice cream by cooking down the guinea pig’s meat and making a pate of sorts before blending it with milk or cream, freezing it, and serving it just like she does with her other flavors.”

“As I became convinced of the practical and theoretical defects of the social-democratic tendencies of my youth, it was but a short distance to a philosophy of restrained, free-market governance that gave more space and place to the individual and to the civil society that stands between citizen and state.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Oct. 25, 2013.

WARREN UNDER FIRE FOR BIOGRAPHY, AGAIN

CBS News: “On the campaign trail, Elizabeth Warren often tells the story of how she was fired from her first teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant, a pivotal moment that ultimately put her on a path to Harvard, the United States Senate, and quite possibly the presidency. But recently, several media outlets have questioned the veracity of these claims. In an exclusive interview with CBS News on Monday evening, Warren said she stands by her characterizations of why she left the job. ‘All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,’ she said. … Asked by CBS News why she told the story differently at Berkeley a decade ago, Warren said her life since her election to the Senate in 2012 caused her to ‘open up’ about her past. … The Washington Free Beacon reported on a transcript from contemporaneous local school board meetings, also obtained by CBS News, which said Warren was rehired that spring and that the board ‘accepted with regret’ her ‘resignation’ the following summer.”



Ed Kilgore: The emerging anybody-but-Warren campaign - NY Mag: “But the problem with Warren that we are beginning to hear about most frequently is the claim that she’s just ‘too liberal’ or ‘too far left’ for otherwise persuadable voters (or donors) to countenance. Thus, in theory, she will lose swing voters that, say, Joe Biden might win, in part because her anti-corporate rhetoric and progressive policy positions will play into the Trump campaign’s clearly planned message that Democrats are all godless, baby-killing, America-hating socialists. Where is this argument coming from, if Warren is leading Trump in trial heats and becoming steadily more popular? Pretty clearly, corporate voices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are taking the lead in demonizing her, for good reason: She’s a threat to their bottom lines and their all-but-sovereign business practices.”



Pennsylvanians unimpressed with 2020 Dems - FOX43: “Pennsylvania's presidential primary in 2020 is among the latest in the country. Only 10 states have primary dates later than April 28. … Of the 650 registered voters polled, 307 were registered Democrats. Of them, a majority of people (52%) say they are still undecided when it comes to who they plan to vote for in the Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden still has the most interest among candidates with 17 percent of Democrats polled saying they would vote for him… Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (9%) and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (8%) both polled ahead of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 6 percent.”



Team Bernie want him to use heart attack to show personal side - WaPo: “Prominent friends and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) say he should cut back on his relentless campaign pace and speak openly about his recent heart attack when he returns to the campaign trail, urging a shift toward a more personal and less hectic campaign than he has run so far. The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders’s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can — or should — maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign. … Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected.”



Klobuchar raises $4.8 million - Politico: “Democrat Amy Klobuchar raised $4.8 million between July and the end of September, her campaign announced Monday, a total that bested the Minnesota Senator’s haul from the previous quarter by $1 million. Klobuchar’s third-quarter fundraising was a fraction of the amount raised by top Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders, who raised the most of any candidate in the field, $25.3 million. But it is likely enough to keep Klobuchar’s campaign functioning as she attempts to secure more support. Klobuchar has qualified for the October Democratic debate and has crossed the donor threshold for the November debate, giving her opportunities to keep making the case for her presidential bid to a national audience.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE

“If, on the other hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies … what a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes!” – John Jay, Federalist No. 4



TIME OUT: CONSEQUENTIAL COW

History: “On October 8, 1871, flames spark in the Chicago barn of Patrick and Catherine O’Leary, igniting a two-day blaze that kills between 200 and 300 people, destroys 17,450 buildings, leaves 100,000 homeless and causes an estimated $200 million (in 1871 dollars; $3 billion in 2007 dollars) in damages. Legend has it that a cow kicked over a lantern in the O’Leary barn and started the fire, but other theories hold that humans or even a comet may have been responsible for the event that left four square miles of the Windy City, including its business district, in ruins. Dry weather and an abundance of wooden buildings, streets and sidewalks made Chicago vulnerable to fire. …Despite the fire’s devastation, much of Chicago’s physical infrastructure, including its water, sewage and transportation systems, remained intact. Reconstruction efforts began quickly and spurred great economic development and population growth, as architects laid the foundation for a modern city featuring the world’s first skyscrapers.”

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT CLIMBING

WaPo: “A majority of Americans say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and nearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step and recommend that the president be removed from office, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. … The poll finds that, by a margin of 58 percent to 38 percent, Americans say the House was correct to undertake the inquiry. ... More than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal. Among the critical voting bloc of independents, support for the impeachment inquiry hits 57 percent, with 49 percent saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office.”



Trump digs in - NYT: “The Trump administration directed a top American diplomat involved in its pressure campaign on Ukraine not to appear Tuesday morning for a scheduled interview in the House’s impeachment inquiry. The decision to block Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, from speaking with investigators for three House committees is certain to provoke an immediate conflict with potentially profound consequences for the White House and President Trump. House Democrats have repeatedly warned that if the administration tries to interfere with their investigation, it will be construed as obstruction, a charge they see as potentially worthy of impeachment. Democrats from the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees did not immediately respond on Tuesday.”



Graham offers Giuliani a stage to fight back - Fox News: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has offered President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a chance to come before lawmakers to detail his allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and his dealings with Ukraine. ‘Have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by [Giuliani] about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor-General Viktor Shokin,’ Graham said Tuesday on Twitter. ‘Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.’ Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday he intends to testify, but needs to go over the offer with the other attorneys involved to determine whether they could sort out issues regarding attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.”



House Dems try to keep whistleblower secret - WaPo: “House Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted their impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent President Trump’s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations. The steps under consideration include having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual’s appearance and voice, these officials said. The efforts reflect Democrats’ deepening distrust of their GOP colleagues, whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower’s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans. ‘There are lots of different protocols and procedures we’re looking into to find out what works and doesn’t work to protect the identity of the whistleblower,’ said a person familiar with the talks.”



Perry under pressure - Politico: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Monday denied that he pressed the Ukrainian government to put two U.S. businessmen on the board of the state energy company or that he was planning to leave the Trump administration. … Perry acknowledged making the recommendations to Ukraine’s state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, but said he did so only at the request of that country’s government. He also said it was ‘true’ that he had pressed President Donald Trump to make the July call to Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. … Perry also denied he was planning to step down from his position, which POLITICO, the New York Times and Washington Post reported last week. ‘I’m here. I’m serving. They’ve been writing the story that I was leaving the Department of Energy for at least nine months now.’”

“We're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's okay that we're all different… but just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them.” – Ellen DeGeneres’ response after receiving backlash for appearing at a Dallas Cowboys football game next to former President George W.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris, you sounded like a Democrat politician when you dodged a direct answer to Meredith Shoemaker’s question [on Monday]. She did not ask you what you thought of President Trump’s call with the Ukrainian President. She asked you very directly ‘what law did President Trump break?’ With the impeachment standard being ‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’ Meredith’s question gets to the heart of the matter. Can I give you second chance here? No Democrat talking points, please. What law?” – Kevin Cook, Farmers Branch, Texas



[Ed. note: So I gather you’re not a Democrat, Mr. Cook! The question of a specific criminal statue here isn’t relevant. Congress’ power to impeach and remove is pretty much unlimited. Andrew Johnson’s impeachment, for example, rested on 11 articles, some relating to specific crimes, but check out the 10th and 11th articles here. How about alleging that Johnson acted “to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach” on Congress? It’s not a crime to ridicule Congress, even for the president. But Congress was asserting that Johnson’s efforts to undermine Congress was a breach of his duties under the constitutional. Or think of a hypothetical. What if a president laid up dead drunk every day at the White House or was posting top secret documents on Instagram? Neither of those things would be illegal for the president to do, but both would surely doubt in his or her impeachment. These are political, not legal considerations. Democrats in this case are focusing on the president seeking help from a foreign power against a political opponent, and the Constitution gives them more than enough room to do so.]



“At the risk of being accused of being ‘too cute by a half,’ until Joe Biden receives the Democratic nomination, can he really be considered a ‘political opponent’ for the purpose of prohibiting the President from asking for investigative assistance from a foreign government? Full disclosure – I am a supporter of President Trump.” – Tim Kasparek, Goodyear, Ariz.

SF Gate: “Reptile breeder Brian Gundy had just given a talk and animal presentation Saturday at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in downtown San Jose. While going to get his car parked on the second level of the Fourth and San Fernando Street garage about 4:30 p.m., he left his snakes and lizards in boxes and a bag in a no-parking zone. When he returned for his critters, he made a grim discovery. ‘As I was loading up my gear, I realized the bag that had my four pythons and blue skink lizard inside was gone and they were just there seconds ago,’ Gundy told KTVU Fox 2. Gundy had seen several people walk by his equipment, so he ran after them but couldn't catch up. He told KTVU he doesn't think they knew what was inside. … The stolen animals were worth approximately $5,000, according to the reptile breeder.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who in recent weeks has been surging in the polls in the Democratic presidential primary race, sought Tuesday to clarify another part of her personal story that's been called into question — namely, her claim that she was fired in the 1970s for being pregnant.

Warren has long told the story of how in 1971 she was fired in the first year of her teaching job because she was “visibly pregnant.” It has been presented as a key moment in her story, propelling her toward Harvard and eventually politics.

VIDEO APPEARS TO CONTRADICT WARREN'S SUGGESTION THAT SCHOOL FIRED HER OVER PREGNANCY

But that story was cast into doubt after a 2007 interview reemerged in which she said she left the job after realizing that the education courses that she needed to take weren’t working out for her.

""I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, 'I don't think this is going to work out for me.' I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years and I was really casting about, thinking, 'What am I going to do?'"" she said.

Most recently, The Washington Free Beacon located county records from the local school board, showing that the board in April 1971 voted to extend Warren a second-year contract similar to the one she held the previous year.

A few months later in June, the minutes show that her resignation was “accepted with regret.”

Warren told CBS News on Monday that her life since becoming a senator has caused her to “open up” about different parts of her life as she stood by her account. And on Tuesday, she reiterated her claims that she was pushed out, indicating that while the contract was extended in April when her pregnancy was not visible, that changed a few months later.

“When I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant — and the principal told me the job I'd already been promised for the next year would go to someone else,” she tweeted.

“This was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination — but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.”

Speaking to CBS, she also stood by her claim of being “shown the door” by the principal.

""When someone calls you in and says the job that you've been hired for for the next year is no longer yours, 'we're giving it to someone else,' I think that's being shown the door,"" she said.

This isn’t the first controversy surrounding Warren’s backstory. The beginning of her campaign was dogged by questions about her claim to have Native American heritage.

In February she apologized to Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her ancestry — a test that an analysis found suggested she was between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American.

So far, other 2020 candidates have not taken aim at Warren for either controversy. On Tuesday, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, asked if Warren has an issue with trust, told Fox News that ""we're all going to go through this X-ray of the soul"" and that ""the people who have been consistent and truthful about where they are, are going to stand up well.""

VARNEY: BERNIE SANDERS' HOSPITALIZATION MAY TIP DEM NOMINATION TO WARREN

Discussing the latest developments on his Fox Nation show, ""My Take,"" Varney said Democrats are scrambling in fear as they begin to realize ""that none of them can beat Donald Trump"" -- and he believes Americans will stick with the president despite an open impeachment investigation.

""For the 2020 Democratic hopefuls, it is in my opinion, a Monday mess,"" Varney said. ""There's mounting anxiety that none of the Democratic candidates can launch a campaign that will beat Donald Trump.""

""Of course,"" Varney continued, ""if you scan the news of the day, you'd think the world turns on impeachment, you'd think the Trump presidency is on its last legs...that's the media's never-ending obsession. Look beneath the screaming headlines, and it's the Democrats' presidential campaigns that are in real trouble.""

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Delving into the Democratic frontrunners, Varney responded to 2020 candidate Joe Biden's recent statement, in which he wrote that he intends to ""beat Trump like a drum"" in 2020.

Biden has had trouble collecting donations recently, Varney said, after he found himself in the middle of the investigation against President Trump over the content of a phone call during which Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

""He is a casualty of the impeachment, he is collateral damage,"" said Varney in an earlier interview.

Varney then turned to Bernie Sanders, who recently took a break from the campaign trail after he ended up in the hospital with heart complications and underwent an emergency procedure to repair a blocked artery, according to his campaign. It was later disclosed that he had suffered a heart attack.

Varney argued that Sanders' hospital visit lends credence to those questioning whether his age will get in the way of securing a spot in the Oval Office.

BERNIE SANDERS HAS STENTS INSERTED AFTER DOCTORS FIND BLOCKAGE

""We wish the Senator well,"" he said, ""but voters have to be a little skeptical that a 78-year-old can return for a year of exhausting campaigning.""

As Senator Elizabeth Warren surges in the polls, Democrats ""who don't buy her far left-leaning policies"" are becoming increasingly alarmed, Varney said.

WARREN FACES NEW QUESTIONS ON CREDIBILITY

""Warren proposes a wealth tax, a lobbying tax, a corporate profits tax, a higher social security tax on the rich, a higher income tax, and a higher tax on gunmakers... Simply put, the calmer voices in the Democratic party understand that Elizabeth Warren is unelectable,"" Varney said.

""The top three all have their troubles and the rest of the pack has failed to break through,"" concluded Varney.

""Wouldn't you think that, with the President under impeachment threat, the candidates trying to succeed him would be powering ahead? They're not,"" he added.

""It's Trump who has raised the most money, it's the Trump base that is united. I'll repeat,"" he continued, ""eight days before the next debate it's a Monday mess for the Democrat hopefuls.""

The former vice president’s $750 billion higher education plan represents a major expansion of the federal government’s role in educating Americans beyond high school. But Biden’s pitch Tuesday is not as sweeping as proposals from his 2020 rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom offer plans exceeding the $1 trillion mark.

JOE BIDEN UNVEILS NEW STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH GROWING UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

The competing approaches reflect Democrats’ efforts to address spiking tuition costs in the United States and the $1.5 trillion-plus in student debt held by about 45 million Americans. The party’s education policy divide is similar to the gap that separates Biden from the two progressive senators on health care, with the former vice president proposing to expand the federal government’s role in the existing health insurance market, while Warren and Sanders propose a single-payer insurance system that would see the federal government essentially replace private insurance altogether.

Jill Biden, the candidate’s wife and a longtime community college professor, explained her husband’s approach.

“My students inspire me,” she said in a conference call with reporters, “and they ask for one thing in return: opportunity.”

The crux of Biden’s higher education plan is a federal-state partnership to cover community college tuition and technical training. Biden calls for the federal government to cover 75 percent of the tuition costs, with states covering the rest. That’s a similar financing concept to the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and the disabled, with states required to cover some costs to qualify for federal money to cover the majority of the program.

Biden proposes that the federal government cover 95 percent of the community college tuition cost at Native Americans’ tribal campuses.

Sanders and Warren propose universal, free access to all undergraduate public colleges and universities.

On student debt, Biden’s more limited approach calls for doubling the Pell Grant program for low-income Americans and cutting in half the income percentage caps on student loan repayments. Borrowers now must pay up to 10 percent of their discretionary income. Biden calls for capping payments at 5 percent of discretionary income, while also delaying payments for anyone making less than $25,000, with the borrower accruing no additional interest.

Biden’s plan would forgive any remaining debt after 20 years of payments and would allow borrowers to get out of their debts as part of personal bankruptcy.

Sanders, conversely, proposes eliminating all student loan debt, while Warren calls for broad debt relief based on income. Warren’s idea would cancel $50,000 in debt for each person with household income under $100,000, with additional proportional relief for those making up to $250,000 annually.

Biden and Warren have another noticeable split on for-profit colleges, which have come under scrutiny because their graduates have a much higher default rate on loans as they struggle to find quality jobs. Biden proposes tighter regulations on those colleges to stop them “from profiteering off of students.” Warren calls for banning such businesses from getting federal money altogether.

All three Democratic hopefuls point to proposed tax increases to pay for their spending. Sanders would tax Wall Street transactions. Warren points to her “wealth tax,” 2 cents on every dollar of a household’s net worth beyond $50 million. Biden calls for eliminating certain breaks in inheritance taxes and capping itemized deductions for the wealthiest Americans."

MICHAEL GOODWIN: HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN -- OR GET OVER IT ALREADY

Clinton famously lost the 2016 presidential election after a long and contentious battle during which Trump repeatedly accused her of wrongdoing and suggested he would prosecute her after winning the White House. Clinton, for her part, later described the email controversy as a ""witch hunt.""

Amid Trump's tweet, polling showed a tight race between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden as they vie for the 2020 Democratic nomination.

Clinton previously said that she has advised multiple candidates during the primary race. Her Tuesday tweet fueled speculation that she might try and run, although she's said she wouldn't. In March, a report surfaced that Clinton hadn't completely shut the door on 2020 and was waiting for the release of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

When Trump tweeted about her possible run, Clinton mocked him with a gif from the movie, ""Mean Girls.""

MINNEAPOLIS' LIBERAL MAYOR TRYING TO 'BULLY' PRESIDENT TRUMP OUT OF MINNESOTA, SAYS HEAD OF POLICE UNION

Warren's elevated profile is attracting new scrutiny of her policy ideas, including a 2% annual tax on the wealth of individuals with more than $50 million and a 3% tax on the wealth of those with over $1 billion. Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., has advanced a similar proposal.

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman and a panel of experts debated if the Warren plan was feasible and at the least constitutional.

Lincoln Mitchell, who is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Political Science at Columbia University, said Warren's proposal highlights a critical concept about inequality.

HOUSE DEMS SUBPOENA PENTAGON, WHITE HOUSE BUDGET OFFICE IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

“The argument is a wealth tax as opposed to an income tax, and this is important because we often think about inequality in America in terms of income, but real inequality is in terms of wealth,"" said Mitchell.

However, Mitchell conceded that the idea may not be practical. “One thing I would say is that is it a hard tax to implement. How do you really measure somebody’s worth, particularly a very wealthy person? What’s that jewelry collection worth? What’s that rare car collection worth? So there are some impracticalities.”

Fox News contributor and columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek, dismissed the tax plan outright.

“There are a lot of reasons why this tax is unpopular or a lot of economists think it is a bad idea. Number one, it may be unconstitutional,"" said Peek. ""The way taxation is supposed to be laid out is it is supposed to be proportional across all states and this probably would not be.”

Mitchell disagreed with Peek's assessment, saying, “Taxes aimed at wealthier people… have stood up to constitutional scrutiny in the past.”

Peek was not finished in her takedown of Warren's proposal.

“Number two, it’s expropriation of people’s possessions and property,"" she said, adding, “generally speaking, it’s a terrible tax. It’s inefficient. That’s why most… countries that implemented it in the 90’s have taken it off the books. Sweden, for example, put it in place and saw enormous amounts of people and capital flee the country to get away from it and that’s sort of the expectation.”

“France had 42,000 millionaires leave between 2000 and 2014,"" said Republican New York City Council Member Joe Borelli. ""They lost Gerard Depardieu of all people, someone who is quintessentially French.”

“That woke them up,” joked Peek.

Lastly, Peek said the bottom line is that the idea is impractical. “It’s absolutely hideous to administer because a lot of wealthy people own private partnerships, they own private equity assets… it’s a full-employment act for accountants and lawyers because – as we know from the inheritance tax – those things can be extremely hard to measure.”

Mitchell accepted Peek's argument, but insisted the Americans should consider new ways to address wealth inequality. “This notion of taxing wealth as opposed to income and thinking of inequality in America in terms of wealth… to me, it is very important. I don’t know if this policy as it is presented now gets us there.”

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator.

Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control.

“I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,” Feinstein said in a statement. “During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard-working American families.”

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

She added: “By making gun reform one of the pillars of his campaign and policy platform, Joe Biden demonstrates that he clearly recognizes what is needed to keep Americans safe. And I know, as president, he will continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.”

Feinstein’s endorsement of Biden may seem like a snub to Harris – a first-term senator and former California attorney general – but it hardly comes out of left field, as just last week she held a fundraiser for the former vice president in her home in San Francisco. Also back in January – following Biden’s campaign launch – Feinstein said that “he brings a level of experience and seniority which I think is really important,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

The endorsement from Feinstein – a longtime liberal lawmaker who was first elected in 1992 – comes as Biden is struggling to hold on to his role as Democratic frontrunner. An average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics has Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren virtually tied at the top of the Democratic race.

Warren, however, has surged in recent months in the polls, while Biden has dropped, and far surpassed him during the most recent quarter of fundraising.

Harris, meanwhile, sits in a distant fifth in the Real Clear Politics average, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg."

Former Vice President Joe Biden is struggling. His money-raise in the third quarter was a pitiful $15 million, nearly $10 million behind Elizabeth Warren.

Joe’s problems mounted (as I predicted) when Democrats jumped into full-impeachment mode. Their focus on Trump’s push to investigate Biden for corruption in Ukraine of course also brought scrutiny to his son Hunter’s lucrative job with Burisma, a local gas company.

That the younger Biden was paid $50,000 per month by a company whose founder had been under investigation for tax evasion and money laundering and that he won that post when his father was the Obama administration’s point person in Ukraine raises reasonable questions. There may have been no wrongdoing, but the episode is an unpleasant reminder that Biden has been a swamp dweller for decades, and swamp mud tends to cling.

Biden’s worst problem, however, is that he has not batted down Trump’s accusations more convincingly. In a recent front-page piece, the New York Times quotes Democrats who bemoan Biden’s response as tepid and worrisome; they see it as evidence he may not be up to the task of confronting Trump on the campaign trail.

David Plouffe, Obama’s former campaign manager, is reportedly “mystified” by Biden’s hesitance, saying the former vice president should “use this moment and become Trump’s opponent.” But, he has not.

Meanwhile, Warren barrels ahead, much to the dismay of moderate Democrats who admire her zeal but worry that with her far-left agenda she cannot win a national election. Warren’s appeal is strong among women, college-educated whites and young people, but she has yet to bring minority voters on board, and she also trails with whites without a college degree. She recently rolled out a lengthy pro-union program aimed at attracting blue-collar workers, but her embrace of “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal has to date not won over that important Democrat cohort.

Hence, the search for a miracle outsider. But would Michelle Obama want to run? And, would she win?

The Obamas are enjoying life in the post-presidential fast lane, frolicking with billionaires and celebrities like Bruce Springsteen, Oprah, David Geffen and Richard Branson, celebrating their new-found freedom on yachts in Tahiti and elsewhere.

They are also celebrating their new-found wealth. Each has reportedly signed book deals worth $60 million, and signed a “high ten-figure” contract to help Netflix produce films. They recently plunked down $15 million for a beachfront home in Martha’s Vineyard; their net worth has been estimated https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-michelle-obama-net-worth-2018-7 to be between at $40 million and $135 million.

Would Michelle give that up? She says no; she has twice declared publicly she would not run. She must know that campaigning against Trump would be ugly, no matter her credentials or popularity.

Past controversies will dog her, like this remark in 2008: “For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country…” Critics will again scrutinize her Princeton thesis; her kids will once more be thrust on the national stage. Running for president is a dirty business.

But there’s a bigger problem awaiting any last-minute entrant into the 2020 race. Bernie Sanders’ supporters are already angry, convinced they were cheated out of victory by the DNC in 2016.

Hillary Clinton blames Bernie (along with scads of other villains) for her 2016 loss, saying he did not campaign hard enough on her behalf. As a result, she claims, some offended Sanders supporters simply stayed home.

The same will be true in 2020 should the party try an end-run – only this time it will be both Sanders’ army and Warren’s fans who will be furious. Combined, those progressives are attracting 41 percent of Democratic primary voters. That large group will be loath to give up their crusade. Sure, Michelle is popular, but will she adopt their favored policies like the Green New Deal or open borders?

Also, it has been clear in recent months that President Obama’s star has faded. Numerous Democrat candidates have been quick to blast his TPP trade deal and even his signature Affordable Care Act, clearly convinced the Obama imprimatur no longer carries much weight with voters. As much as Biden clings to his relationship with the former president, the less it seems to matter.

Maybe that’s because Democrats now concede that the former president demolished their party; under his leadership, Democrats lost 18 governorships and 816 state legislative seats, 12 seats in the U.S. Senate seats and 64 in the House. Obama left the party politically and financially bankrupt.

Because of those Obama-era losses, President Trump has been able to enact tax and regulation reforms, and appoint hundreds of judges and two Associate Justices of the Supreme Court. Do Democrats really want to travel down that road again?

Middle-class incomes surging – thanks to Trump policies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/steve-moore-democrats-are-wrong-middle-class-incomes-surging-thanks-to-trump-policies,"The latest Census Bureau Current Population Survey data now show that middle-class incomes, after adjusting for inflation, have surged by $5,003 since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. Median household income has now reached $65,976 – an all-time high and up more than 8 percent in 2019 dollars under the Trump presidency.

This data was compiled by the statisticians at Sentier Research, an economic research group whose founders have more than 30 years of experience at the Census Bureau in analyzing the monthly income numbers.

I reported last week in the Wall Street Journal that real median family income had soared by $4,146 under Trump through July 2019. The just-released August numbers from Sentier show a huge monthly gain of $857 in income per household.

MIKE HUCKABEE: TRUMP ECONOMY IS DELIVERING HIGHER INCOMES AND RECORD EMPLOYMENT FOR AMERICANS

These numbers contrast sharply with the 16 years prior to Trump’s presidency. In the eight years that George W. Bush was president, median income barely showed any gain, up just $401 thanks to the deep recession of 2008.

In the seven and a half years that Barack Obama was president, and not including the end of the recession, which Obama inherited, incomes inched up by $1,043 (June 2009 – January 2019). This means that in the 16 years before the Trump presidency, incomes rose by about $1,500 while in less than three years middle incomes have risen three times faster.

The contrast is even sharper when measured on a monthy basis. The monthly rise in incomes under Bush was $4. That number was $11 under Obama and $161 under Trump.

These income numbers are PRE-TAX, so they do NOT include the impact of the Trump tax cut. The Heritage Foundation estimates that the average household has saved $1,400 a year on their federal taxes from the 2017 Trump tax cut. This means many working-class families now have a $6,000 higher after-tax, and after-inflation paycheck today.

These surges in income, especially in the last several months, have occurred at exactly the time when many liberal economists and media talking heads were shouting “recession.” In reality middle-class families were enjoying a near-unprecedented income windfall and “the gains in income levels in recent months,” Sentier reports, “have been accelerating.“

These surges in income, especially in the last several months, have occurred at exactly the time when many liberal economists and media talking heads were shouting “recession.”

These higher wage and salary incomes are no doubt related to the very tight labor market, which has given workers new bargaining power to ask for higher pay. Today there are more than seven million unfilled jobs in America – the highest number of surplus jobs in American history.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

These latest income numbers also squarely contradict the claims by Democratic presidential candidates, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who claim that all the gains from the Trump economy have gone to the rich and large corporations. Warren claimed earlier this year that workers had to work ""two or three or four jobs"" just to keep their incomes from falling.

No, this has been one of the biggest middle-class success stories in modern times, and it is a testament to the success of the Trump tax, regulatory and energy policies.

The network said it would wait to announce the format, moderators, and specific location but did announce it would host the debate in cooperation with The Washington Post.

It also commented on which Democrats appeared to qualify for the debate. As of Tuesday, the field included former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

For the fifth debate, Democratic candidates need to receive 165,000 unique donors -- including 600 spread out over 20 states -- and reach 3 percent in ""four qualifying state or national polls."" They can also make the stage with 5 percent in two qualifying state polls.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

According to the announcement, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have yet to meet the polling requirements.

NBC hosted the first Democratic primary debate in June with anchors Chuck Todd, Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt, Jose Diaz-Balart, and Rachel Maddow. That debate sparked an early controversy between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who also qualified for the fifth debate, after the former made controversial comments about racial issues.

Since June, the 2020 field has narrowed but at least 12 remained and qualified for the fourth debate set to take place in Ohio. That debate will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times on Oct. 15. Given the much smaller field, NBC can apparently avoid the two-night format of the first debate.

The DNC announced that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by the deadline.

The shooting took place around 2:30 a.m., police said in a press release. At that time, the store was open because of overnight construction, Fox 4 reported.

A police spokesman said the store’s back door was open so construction workers could go in and out. The suspect, clad in body armor and armed with an assault rifle, entered the rear of the building “in an attempt to commit a robbery,” Sgt. Warren Mitchell said.

The burglar then allegedly tried to disarm a security guard who was sitting by the door. The security guard pulled out his weapon and fired “multiple shots at the suspect,” Mitchell said.

The burglar fled the store but collapsed in an alley. He was taken to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead, police said.

The letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray -- signed by GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee -- came as Democrats have sought to relitigate the Kavanaugh issue, with virtually all of the party's 2020 presidential contenders calling for the justice to be impeached.

The first criminal referral, the senators wrote, concerned the ""false allegation made by an individual who told the [Judiciary] Committee that he had direct knowledge that Judge Kavanaugh assaulted a close friend on a boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island in 1985.""

The Twitter account belonging to that accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration. The accuser, who had contacted the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later, after an investigation by Senate Republicans.

The second referral involved a claim from disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and client Julie Swetnick, alleging that Kavanaugh participated in gang-rape trains.

""After a thorough investigation, the committee found no verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations made in the declaration,"" the senators wrote. ""The committee also found that both Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick had a long history of credibility issues and may have criminally conspired to mislead the committee and obstruct its investigation.""

EX-BOYFRIEND TELLS FOX NEWS THAT SWETNICK THREATENED TO KILL UNBORN CHILD, ALWAYS EXAGGERATED STORIES

The third referral specifically implicated Avenatti, who submitted a ""sworn statement by an unknown declarant claimed that Judge Kavanaugh had spiked the punch at house parties with Quaaludes and/or grain alcohol."" NBC News later reported that the apparent declarant had said Avenatti ""twisted her words.""

The final referral concerned a claim by Judy Munro-Leighton, who had sent an email to the Judiciary Committee indicating that she was ""the author of an unsigned letter containing highly graphic sexual-assault accusations against Judge Kavanaugh previously received by the office of Senator Kamala Harris."" But, when committee staff later interviewed her, ""she admitted that she falsely identified herself as the author of the letter and its allegations and had only claimed authorship 'as a way to grab attention.'""

The letter added: ""When asked by committee investigators if she had ever met Judge Kavanaugh, she said: 'Oh Lord, no.'""

'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS

In the process of evaluating claims against Kavanaugh, the senators wrote that committee investigators ""collected 25 written statements and spoke with 45 individuals,"" and those investigations ""culminated in the nominee’s confirmation and the release of a 414-page committee report concluding that there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations.""

The senators asked Wray and Barr to provide an update by Oct. 21. Specifically, the senators requested to know ""for each criminal referral made by the committee to the FBI, did the FBI open a criminal investigation? If so, which investigation(s) resulted in a referral to the Justice Department for prosecution? If not, why not?""

Additionally, the senators asked: ""For each case that was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution, which cases were rejected and which were accepted for prosecution?""

""The next Supreme Court nominee should not have to defend himself or herself against baseless and fabricated allegations, and committee staff should not have to spend valuable time investigating them,"" the senators concluded.

Thom Tillis: Dems' strategy of personal destruction against Trump began with Brett Kavanaugh,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-strategy-personal-destruction-trump-kavanaugh-thom-tillis,"Monday, October 7, marks one year since Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. He is already proving to be a brilliant and fair-minded conservative jurist who follows the Constitution as written.

While Kavanaugh will undoubtedly make his lasting mark on the Court in the coming decades, his confirmation process will, unfortunately, go down in history as one of the low points of American politics.

It will be remembered as the moment in which Democrats, starving for a political victory following their stunning defeat to President Trump in 2016, adopted a politics of personal destruction strategy, launching a highly coordinated smear campaign against the president’s judicial nominee.

GREGG JARRETT: THE PELOSI-SCHIFF 'WITCH HUNT' TO IMPEACH TRUMP IS AN ABUSE OF POWER

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was on the frontline throughout the entire confirmation process and was one of Kavanaugh’s staunchest supporters.

It was surreal to see my Democratic colleagues abandon the basic tenants of due process, presuming Kavanaugh guilty until proven innocent.

Encouraged by their fanatical, left-wing base and a pliant media, no allegation was too far-fetched to embrace. They even sunk so low that they hyped up the egregiously false allegations made by the client of con-man lawyer Michael Avenatti. It was a disgrace.

Fortunately, their smear campaign failed. The truth prevailed and Kavanaugh was confirmed.

Fast forward to just a few weeks ago, when Democratic presidential candidates and mainstream media outlets pounced on a completely uncorroborated allegation against Kavanaugh published by The New York Times in the paper’s Opinion section.

The Democrats’ impeachment push is about overturning the results of the 2016 election, covering up their socialist and open borders policies, and destroying President Trump personally and politically to pave their path to victory in 2020.

Democrats like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris rushed to call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. However, the American people soon learned that the authors conveniently left out vital exculpatory facts, forcing the New York Times to issue an editor’s note correcting the story.

While September may have started with Democrats’ aiming their politics of personal destruction and calls for impeachment at Kavanaugh, it ended with them doing the same against President Trump.

We already know more about the facts of President Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart than the so-called “whistleblower” did because we’ve seen the transcript, unlike the individual who filed the complaint. The transcript directly contradicts the Democratic narrative that the president engaged in a “quid pro quo.”

The latest impeachment push is already unfolding in a way that’s eerily similar to the Kavanaugh spectacle, including Democrats knowing about the allegations before they were made public -- giving them time to create their narrative in advance.

This week the public learned that Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and his staff were working with the so-called whistleblower and encouraged him or her to file the complaint.

It’s no surprise that Democrats have already deemed the facts as irrelevant because their end game is removing President Trump from power using any means necessary.

They're not even trying to hide what their motivation is with Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, recently declaring on national television that “I’m concerned if we don’t impeach this president, he will get re-elected.”

That’s exactly why Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for an impeachment inquiry before she even saw the transcript of the president’s call with the Ukrainian leader. And it’s why Schiff tried to deceive the American public by reading a completely fabricated transcript to make the president look bad.

Democrats, including those running against me in North Carolina, are taking a page out of their Kavanaugh playbook by pushing impeachment because it’s the only play they have left.

At the end of the day, Democrats know they can’t beat President Trump on the issues the American people care about.

They know they can’t beat President Trump by attacking his record of generating record economic growth, securing the border, appointing conservative judges, rebuilding our military, making major reforms to the VA and cutting taxes for hardworking Americans.

The only alternative Democrats are offering Americans is a radical liberal agenda that the American people refuse to buy.

They want to eliminate your employer-provided health insurance, increase the taxes on the money you worked hard for and even implement radical policies like the Green New Deal to prevent you from eating hamburgers and driving the cars you to want to drive.

Campos-Duffy's advice for parents was sparked by her recent visit to Marquette University in Wisconsin where she was invited by Young America’s Foundation club (YAF) to speak about the importance of defending American capitalism.

LAURA INGRAHAM: RECANTED HATE CRIME PART OF 'P.C. CULTURE AND A VICTIMOLOGY CULTURE GONE TOTALLY AWRY'

She was confronted by campus protesters and she wrote about it in an op-ed published on Fox Business.

In the piece, Campos-Duffy recalled that she was prepared for her critics, but she was taken by surprise by a Chinese foreign exchange student, who stood up and ""taught all of us that night a lesson in the dangers of romanticizing socialism and communism.""

""After asking a thoughtful question, I asked him if he would explain to the students in the room how the Chinese social credit system worked,"" she wrote.

""He described how the Communist Chinese government tracks its citizens’ phones, internet use, attendance to Communist party events and other activities and uses this 'score' to determine your family’s financial fate, the quality of education your child receives, and whether you will be arrested or punished for thinking the wrong thoughts. I was alarmed by how many of the students in the room were unaware of this fact of life in Communist China.""

On ""Fox and Friends,"" Campos-Duffy said that she came away from that experience with the conviction that parents must step up to teach their children, when educators, politicians and public figures do not.

""What I found on college campuses is -- with the exception of a few ... conservative students -- so many kids are falling for the lies and the promises of 'free'... that are being sold today by [New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], by [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders and by [Massachusetts Sen.] Elizabeth Warren,"" said Campos-Duffy.

""The question is what do you do about it? And my experience is that you have to start young -- you can't wait until your kids come home with the stories from their socialist professors at the university. If you're not having a conversation with your young kids at home then somebody else is,"" she concluded.

Campos-Duffy also previewed an important new episode of her Fox Nation show, ""Moms,"" where she interviews women of all different backgrounds about the challenges of motherhood.

""We actually travel to Texas to meet with real-life moms there, who are dealing with fertility issues, so it's a really heavy topic, but so much hope, so much love and compassion that was shared inside of that story... More people than we think are struggling with this, so its a topic that we really wanted to touch on,"" Campos-Duffy told ""Fox and Friends"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt.

In that episode, which will be available on Fox Nation on October 10, one mother shared her heartbreaking story of turning to in vitro fertilization after the death of her first child.

""We learned about mid-way through our pregnancy that she had some physical abnormalities that led them to believe that there may be genetic abnormalities as wel l... unfortunately when she was born she had a rare lung disease that she passed from, "" she said. ""In order to avoid that happening again and not have to make a choice with each pregnancy, we decided to do IVF -- which led us to our second daughter Avery, and she's 10 months old now.""

Eddie Rispone (R) was second in the poll with 25%, followed by Ralph Abraham (R) at 19%.

* At home in Vermont yesterday, Bernie Sanders told reporters that in the wake of his heart attack that he’ll have to “change the nature of the campaign a bit.” The independent senator suggested the shift will mean holding fewer campaign events.

* Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is nothing if not shameless, his re-election campaign yesterday began promoting a Politico article pointing to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s alleged favoritism for Kentucky. Chao, of course, is McConnell’s wife. “Mitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset,” the senator’s team wrote in a tweet highlighting the report.

* Probate judge Steven Reed (D) made history yesterday, becoming the first African-American mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.

* And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) has thrown her endorsement to Joe Biden, looking past her fellow California senator, Kamala Harris. Feinstein had previously indicated support for Biden in January, but that was before most of the Democratic candidates had formally launched their campaigns. Biden now has five endorsements from sitting U.S. senators, more than any other Democratic candidate."

In the expected runoff, scheduled November 16, the poll shows Edwards leading Abraham, 53% to 38%.

* With Donald Trump slated to hold a rally in Minneapolis this week, there’s apparently a brewing dispute between the president’s campaign team and local officials over security costs associated with the event. It’s why Trump has spent much of the morning lashing out at Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey via Twitter.

* Speaking of Minnesota, Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s Democratic presidential campaign reported a third-quarter fundraising haul of $4.8 million, which isn’t great, but which is more than enough to meet the threshold for the party’s November primary debate. Klobuchar has not, however, yet met the polling threshold to participate in the event.

* The New York Times had an interesting item the other day on prominent members of the Republican Party’s “Never Trump” contingent who’ve since changed their minds. The article noted Erick Erickson, among others, who vowed, “I will not vote for Donald Trump. Ever,” only to recently change direction.

* With Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) stepping down in a couple of months for health reasons, Republicans are lining up to ask Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to appoint them to the seat. Among the latest is former Rep. Jack Kingston (R), who lost in his Senate bid in 2014, and who last week reminded the governor’s office that he’s “aggressively defended President Trump at every turn” and “spent 30 years taking on the Democrats’ misguided agenda.”

* With only four weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the Democratic Governors Association is running this ad targeting Gov. Matt Bevin (R) for trying to derail the state’s Medicaid-expansion program, which is a story we discussed in some detail a few years ago.

* And in California, the latest Public Policy Institute of California poll found Elizabeth Warren narrowly leading Joe Biden, 23% to 22%, with Bernie Sanders right behind them with 21%. Kamala Harris is still running fourth in her home state with 8% support in the poll."

Arnold Schwarzenegger said Monday that he ""could"" vote for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in the 2020 presidential election.

""I would just have to see what her program is, what her vision is for the future of America because I think the most important thing is we keep America number one,” Schwarzenegger told ""The Howard Stern Show,"" according to The Hill.

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BELIEVES DONALD TRUMP IS 'IN LOVE' WITH HIM: 'HE WANTS TO BE ME'

When asked whether he would support President Trump's reelection in 2020, Schwarzenegger laughed and said: ""I doubt it.""

""I will find out what is happening on the Democratic side because, I mean, there's a lot of weird stuff going on there,"" the Austria-born actor added.

The 72-year-old Schwarzenegger has engaged in a long-standing feud with President Trump, who Schwarzenegger replaced as host of NBC's ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2015. Last month, Schwarzenegger said that Trump wanted to be him and was ""in love"" with him.

“I don’t think he fears me,"" the former ""Terminator"" star said during an interview. ""But I remember that in the old days when we went to the wrestling matches, the way he admired people with bodies, and the way they would jump around in the ring, and to perform physical stunts and stuff like that — he had great admiration for that.""

Trump previously bashed Schwarzenegger for his performance on the reality show.

""Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad [pathetic] ratings, not by me. Sad end to great show,"" Trump tweeted in 2017. In that same year, Schwarzenegger said he wanted to ""smash"" Trump's ""face.""

The announcement came in a campaign video posted to Twitter, which shows the Massachusetts senator visiting a neighborhood in southwest Detroit, often referred to as the most polluted area in Michigan, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who represents the district. In the clip, Warren speaks to community members about residents who have been diagnosed with cancer linked to exposure to toxins after years of living in the shadow of a massive oil refinery.

WARREN FACING SCRUTINY OVER CLAIM SHE WAS FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT

In line with her overarching campaign to end corruption in Washington, Warren calls the pollution in these communities a result of “decades of discrimination and environmental racism,” saying it is “unacceptable and it must change.”

The plan, which has been posted to her website, builds upon policies covering everything from affordable housing to green manufacturing to clean energy. She stresses the need to build “strong, resilient communities” by doing more than just “cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.”

According to the campaign, this would mean identifying the most at-risk communities and requiring all federal agencies to consider the climate impact of any proposed projects. Warren also calls for investing in the nation’s public water systems, ending the privatization of those systems and enforcing water quality standards.

The plan is vague on how exactly the $1 trillion would be spent, but also calls for grants to long-term residents of ""redlined"" communities that were once discriminated against financially ""so that they can buy homes in the neighborhood of their choice and start to build wealth.""

Warren's plan is one of many multitrillion-dollar commitments from the Democratic field that have raised questions over how they would be funded. Her climate policy claims that an added corporate profit tax, as well as reversing part of the Trump administration's tax cuts, would finance the programs.

WARREN SLIPS AHEAD OF BIDEN IN LATEST POLL

Warren also vows to get tough on polluting companies. This includes reinstituting the Superfund Waste Tax, which ensures hazardous waste sites are properly cleaned up and expired in 1995. “Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions — not leave them for the communities to clean up. I’ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess,” she says.

Warren’s environmental justice policy comes ahead of a campaign swing through South Carolina, California, and Nevada later in the week."

Elizabeth Warren proved she's ""more Native American than capitalist"" and is seeking to fundamentally change America's financial system for the worse, said former CKE Restaurants CEO Andy Puzder on ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday.

Puzder was responding to Warren's letter to J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, urging him and other financial leaders to support her 2020 campaign agenda.

""I expect that you will endorse and wholeheartedly support the reforms laid out in the Accountable Capitalism Act,"" she wrote.

WARREN ACCUSES LARGE U.S. COMPANIES OF BEING DISLOYAL TO AMERICANS IN NEW CAMPAIGN AD, CALLS HER PAN 'ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM'

""I don't know what view [Warren] has of capitalism,"" Puzder said. ""She claims she's a capitalist to the core -- I think she's more Native American than she is capitalist. I mean, this letter is ridiculous. She writes it like she's the premier of China, ordering corporations in China to do X or to do Y.""

Puzder claimed Warren's platform attacks the very foundation of business and free enterprise that drives wealth in the United States and said everyday Americans will see their 401(k)'s take a hit if she assumes office.

""She attacks corporate profits, which is how businesses stay in business -- it's how they make money [so] that they can pay dividends,"" he said. ""She then attacks dividends which is how corporations get money out, not only to individuals or corporate executives... but also to 401(k) plans and pension plans.

""If pension plans -- if their dividends are cut, they're not going to be able to meet their obligations to retirees,"" Puzder continued. ""The entire letter she wrote to Jamie Dimon was an embarrassment. I hope people actually read it.""

Puzder also said Warren's policies would ironically widen the wealth gap and stifle economic growth, all in the name of redistribution of wealth.

""People's wages are up, there are more people working than have ever worked in the history of this country. They're making more money. They're taking home more money because of the tax cuts, and income inequality is shrinking. So what she wants to do would hurt the economy, it would hurt workers, it would increase income inequality. It would do all of the things that she says she's opposed to."""

In Warren’s 2017 book, “This Fight is Our Fight,” she recalls that her mother’s temper boiled over during an argument about the high cost of attending college.

“Quick as lightning, she hit me hard in the face,” the Democratic senator from Massachusetts wrote.

WARREN STANDS BY CLAIM SCHOOL FORCED HER OUT OF TEACHING JOB DUE TO PREGNANCY

But the incident -- and Warren’s memory of her mother’s aggression -- are missing from a very similar story about going away to college in an earlier book called “A Fighting Chance.”

“My mother kept saying no, but then Daddy surprised both of us, saying: ‘Let her try, Polly,’” Warren wrote in the 2014 book.

This description of her mother, Polly Herring, as ultimately supportive, instead of physically forceful, is consistent with an even earlier book, “The Two Income Trap.”

“When I was a senior in high school, she talked about quitting, but she decided to keep working so that she and my father could help with the cost of my college tuition,” Warren wrote in 2003.

As a presidential candidate, Warren often weaves stories about her own struggles as a student into proposals for things like tuition-free college and student loan debt cancellation.

But recently discovered discrepancies raise new questions about the accuracy of her stories on the stump.

The Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News about why her descriptions about the same set of conversations about college are so different.

But Warren did explain her approach to sharing her biography in an attempt to clarify a similar story, about her claims that she was passed over for a teaching job in her twenties because she was pregnant, despite newly-uncovered records suggesting otherwise.

“After becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them,” Warren told CBS News.

Most famously when it comes to her biography, Warren has repeatedly faced questions throughout her political career about her past claims of Native American ancestry. She doesn't identify that way anymore and has faced accusations from Republicans that she once did so to advance her academic career."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she is committed to forgoing big-money fundraisers if she wins the Democratic nomination, no matter how much money President Trump pulls in from his supporters.

""I’m not going to go do the big-dollar fund-raisers. I’m just not going to do it,” Warren told CBS in an interview posted Tuesday. The 2020 hopeful said that her campaign was predicated on the notion ""that we can build this together. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.”

CBS reporter Zak Hudak had asked Warren whether she could guarantee her supporters she wouldn't utilize big-dollar fundraisers.

Warren claimed that without financial independence, candidates would continue serving wealthy interests after they were elected to office.

DEMS PUBLICLY TOUT SMALL DOLLAR DONATIONS WHILE QUIETLY COURTING BIG DOLLAR DONORS

""I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,” Warren said. “Look, for me, this is pretty straightforward. Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible.

""Or you think it’s about a grass-roots, let’s build this from the ground up.”

That answer appeared to represent a reversal for Warren after she expressed openness to big-dollar donors in a general election. Not doing so, she indicated, was ""unilateral disarmament.""

""We’ll be up against a Republican machine that will be hell-bent on keeping the White House,"" she told MSNBC in February. ""They will have PACs and Super PACs and too many special interest groups to count, and we will do what is necessary to match them financially. That means investing -- starting now -- in each and every one of our state parties, and in our national party too.”

It's unclear what was behind Warren's apparent reversal but her comments came just days after her campaign announced it had raised $24.6 million from more than half a million individual donors in the third quarter of this year. That was substantially higher than the $15.2 million raised by former Vice President Joe Biden but slightly lower than the $25.3 million raised by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

If Warren wins the Democratic nomination, she would likely face an incumbent candidate backed by a Republican Party that has recorded record-breaking fundraising numbers.

In the third quarter alone, the Republican National Committee and President Trump's campaign raised $125 million. Within just 24 hours in September, those two entities raked in an eye-popping $5 million -- an apparent backlash to the formal impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. So far in 2019, those two organizations have raised $308 million.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Sandra Smith, Pavlich predicted that Warren will increasingly face scrutiny for her ""pattern"" of autobiographical stories that just don't add up.

On Tuesday, Warren -- who in recent weeks has been surging in the polls -- attempted to clarify another personal story that has been called into question. She has repeatedly claimed that in 1971, she was fired from a teaching job because she was ""visibly pregnant."" The dismissal has been presented as a turning point for Warren that propelled her toward a Harvard Law professorship and a career in politics.

However, Warren said in a 2007 interview that she left the job after realizing that the education courses that she needed to take weren’t working out for her.

VIDEO APPEARS TO CONTRADICT WARREN'S SUGGESTION THAT SCHOOL FIRED HER OVER PREGNANCY

""I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, 'I don't think this is going to work out for me.' I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years and I was really casting about, thinking, 'What am I going to do?'"" she said.

""Elizabeth Warren's team is saying that her contract was renewed when she was only four months pregnant and not showing that she was pregnant,"" Pavlich noted. ""They're not denying and they're not clarifying this discrepancy between the two stories.""

""And, it really comes and brings into light Elizabeth Warren's pattern now of telling stories that don't necessarily add up about her background and her efforts to turn herself into a victim in some ways,"" she told Smith. ""As she goes for that frontrunner status against Joe Biden, she's certainly going to face a lot more scrutiny about her claims of victimhood that she's using in her campaign stump speeches on the campaign trail.""

On Monday, The Washington Free Beacon located records from the local school board. Those records showed that the board in April 1971 voted to extend Warren a second-year contract similar to the one she held the previous year.

WARREN FACES MOUNTING QUESTIONS ON ANOTHER PART OF HER PERSONAL STORY: WAS SHE FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT?

That June, the board's minutes show that Warren's resignation was “accepted with regret.”

On Tuesday, Warren repeated her claim that she was pushed out, indicating that while the contract was extended in April when her pregnancy was not visible, that changed a few months later.

In an interview with CBS, Warren also stood by her claim of being ""shown the door"" by the principal.

""When someone calls you in and says the job that you've been hired for the next year is no longer yours, 'we're giving it to someone else,' I think that's being shown the door,"" she said.

""We are in the age of authenticity,"" said Pavlich, ""and Elizabeth Warren has had a really hard time maintaining her authenticity through these stories she keeps telling about discrimination against herself.

""When in fact, she's using these things like the story of her alleged mistreatment or discrimination because she was pregnant - even though the documents show otherwise,"" she added, ""to get ahead in the polls, to try and relate to women, to build policy platforms, to argue that women are maybe still discriminated against in the workplace because they are pregnant.""

The populist senator from Massachusetts who has produced one progressive plan after another stands at 29 percent support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the survey. Biden – who for months was the unrivaled front-runner – registers at 26 percent. Warren’s three-point advantage over the former vice president is within the poll’s margin of error.

“Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders – the progressive independent from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – received 16 percent support.

Warren was at 27 percent, Biden 25 percent, and Sanders 16 percent in Quinnipiac's last Democratic primary poll, which was released two weeks ago.

QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER WARREN'S STUMP SPEECH STORY THAT SHE LOST HER TEACHING JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a distant fourth, at 4 percent, in the new survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang stand at 3 percent in the survey. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota register at 2 percent, with everyone one else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates coming in at 1 percent or less.

Biden tops President Trump 51-40 percent in a hypothetical general election matchup. But that’s down from a 16 percentage point lead over the GOP president in Quinnipiac’s late August poll. Warren’s ahead of Trump by eight points in the new survey, down from a 12-point lead in August. And Sanders beat the president by 7 points, down from a 14 point lead in the previous poll.

The new poll also indicates that registered voters nationwide remain divided over impeaching and removing the president from office over the Ukrainian crisis.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY GETS MAJORITY SUPPORT IN NEW POLL

Forty-five percent of registered voters say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 49 percent opposing such a move. Voters were evenly split at 47 percent in last week’s Quinnipiac survey. But a Quinnipiac poll released late last month – before news of the Ukrainian crisis broke – indicated support for impeachment at just 37 percent.

The new poll indicates 53-43 percent majority support for impeachment inquiry being conducted the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, a slight uptick from 52-45 percent backing for the investigation a week ago.

As expected, there’s a vast partisan divide, with 92 percent of Democrats saying the inquiry’s legitimate and 88 percent of Republicans calling it a witch hunt. By a 52-40 percent margin, independents say the investigation into Trump is legitimate.

Trump’s under fire over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country that’s been battling Russia this decade. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a read-out of the call released by the White House, Democrats argue the president was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

The president and allies have instead tried to put the spotlight in the scandal on Biden, a political rival who’s hoping to face off against the president in next year’s election.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 4-7, with 1,483 self-identified registered voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percent for questions to the 646 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents."

WARREN UNDER FIRE FOR BIOGRAPHY, AGAIN

CBS News: “On the campaign trail, Elizabeth Warren often tells the story of how she was fired from her first teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant, a pivotal moment that ultimately put her on a path to Harvard, the United States Senate, and quite possibly the presidency. But recently, several media outlets have questioned the veracity of these claims. In an exclusive interview with CBS News on Monday evening, Warren said she stands by her characterizations of why she left the job. ‘All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,’ she said. … Asked by CBS News why she told the story differently at Berkeley a decade ago, Warren said her life since her election to the Senate in 2012 caused her to ‘open up’ about her past. … The Washington Free Beacon reported on a transcript from contemporaneous local school board meetings, also obtained by CBS News, which said Warren was rehired that spring and that the board ‘accepted with regret’ her ‘resignation’ the following summer.”



Ed Kilgore: The emerging anybody-but-Warren campaign - NY Mag: “But the problem with Warren that we are beginning to hear about most frequently is the claim that she’s just ‘too liberal’ or ‘too far left’ for otherwise persuadable voters (or donors) to countenance. Thus, in theory, she will lose swing voters that, say, Joe Biden might win, in part because her anti-corporate rhetoric and progressive policy positions will play into the Trump campaign’s clearly planned message that Democrats are all godless, baby-killing, America-hating socialists. Where is this argument coming from, if Warren is leading Trump in trial heats and becoming steadily more popular? Pretty clearly, corporate voices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are taking the lead in demonizing her, for good reason: She’s a threat to their bottom lines and their all-but-sovereign business practices.”



Pennsylvanians unimpressed with 2020 Dems - FOX43: “Pennsylvania's presidential primary in 2020 is among the latest in the country. Only 10 states have primary dates later than April 28. … Of the 650 registered voters polled, 307 were registered Democrats. Of them, a majority of people (52%) say they are still undecided when it comes to who they plan to vote for in the Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden still has the most interest among candidates with 17 percent of Democrats polled saying they would vote for him… Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (9%) and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (8%) both polled ahead of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 6 percent.”



Team Bernie want him to use heart attack to show personal side - WaPo: “Prominent friends and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) say he should cut back on his relentless campaign pace and speak openly about his recent heart attack when he returns to the campaign trail, urging a shift toward a more personal and less hectic campaign than he has run so far. The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders’s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can — or should — maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign. … Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected.”



Klobuchar raises $4.8 million - Politico: “Democrat Amy Klobuchar raised $4.8 million between July and the end of September, her campaign announced Monday, a total that bested the Minnesota Senator’s haul from the previous quarter by $1 million. Klobuchar’s third-quarter fundraising was a fraction of the amount raised by top Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders, who raised the most of any candidate in the field, $25.3 million. But it is likely enough to keep Klobuchar’s campaign functioning as she attempts to secure more support. Klobuchar has qualified for the October Democratic debate and has crossed the donor threshold for the November debate, giving her opportunities to keep making the case for her presidential bid to a national audience.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE

“If, on the other hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies … what a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes!” – John Jay, Federalist No. 4



TIME OUT: CONSEQUENTIAL COW

History: “On October 8, 1871, flames spark in the Chicago barn of Patrick and Catherine O’Leary, igniting a two-day blaze that kills between 200 and 300 people, destroys 17,450 buildings, leaves 100,000 homeless and causes an estimated $200 million (in 1871 dollars; $3 billion in 2007 dollars) in damages. Legend has it that a cow kicked over a lantern in the O’Leary barn and started the fire, but other theories hold that humans or even a comet may have been responsible for the event that left four square miles of the Windy City, including its business district, in ruins. Dry weather and an abundance of wooden buildings, streets and sidewalks made Chicago vulnerable to fire. …Despite the fire’s devastation, much of Chicago’s physical infrastructure, including its water, sewage and transportation systems, remained intact. Reconstruction efforts began quickly and spurred great economic development and population growth, as architects laid the foundation for a modern city featuring the world’s first skyscrapers.”

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT CLIMBING

WaPo: “A majority of Americans say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and nearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step and recommend that the president be removed from office, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. … The poll finds that, by a margin of 58 percent to 38 percent, Americans say the House was correct to undertake the inquiry. ... More than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal. Among the critical voting bloc of independents, support for the impeachment inquiry hits 57 percent, with 49 percent saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office.”



Trump digs in - NYT: “The Trump administration directed a top American diplomat involved in its pressure campaign on Ukraine not to appear Tuesday morning for a scheduled interview in the House’s impeachment inquiry. The decision to block Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, from speaking with investigators for three House committees is certain to provoke an immediate conflict with potentially profound consequences for the White House and President Trump. House Democrats have repeatedly warned that if the administration tries to interfere with their investigation, it will be construed as obstruction, a charge they see as potentially worthy of impeachment. Democrats from the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees did not immediately respond on Tuesday.”



Graham offers Giuliani a stage to fight back - Fox News: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has offered President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a chance to come before lawmakers to detail his allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and his dealings with Ukraine. ‘Have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by [Giuliani] about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor-General Viktor Shokin,’ Graham said Tuesday on Twitter. ‘Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.’ Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday he intends to testify, but needs to go over the offer with the other attorneys involved to determine whether they could sort out issues regarding attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.”



House Dems try to keep whistleblower secret - WaPo: “House Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted their impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent President Trump’s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations. The steps under consideration include having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual’s appearance and voice, these officials said. The efforts reflect Democrats’ deepening distrust of their GOP colleagues, whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower’s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans. ‘There are lots of different protocols and procedures we’re looking into to find out what works and doesn’t work to protect the identity of the whistleblower,’ said a person familiar with the talks.”



Perry under pressure - Politico: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Monday denied that he pressed the Ukrainian government to put two U.S. businessmen on the board of the state energy company or that he was planning to leave the Trump administration. … Perry acknowledged making the recommendations to Ukraine’s state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, but said he did so only at the request of that country’s government. He also said it was ‘true’ that he had pressed President Donald Trump to make the July call to Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. … Perry also denied he was planning to step down from his position, which POLITICO, the New York Times and Washington Post reported last week. ‘I’m here. I’m serving. They’ve been writing the story that I was leaving the Department of Energy for at least nine months now.’”

“We're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's okay that we're all different… but just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them.” – Ellen DeGeneres’ response after receiving backlash for appearing at a Dallas Cowboys football game next to former President George W. Bush, whom she calls a friend.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris, you sounded like a Democrat politician when you dodged a direct answer to Meredith Shoemaker’s question [on Monday]. She did not ask you what you thought of President Trump’s call with the Ukrainian President. She asked you very directly ‘what law did President Trump break?’ With the impeachment standard being ‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’ Meredith’s question gets to the heart of the matter. Can I give you second chance here? No Democrat talking points, please. What law?” – Kevin Cook, Farmers Branch, Texas



[Ed. note: So I gather you’re not a Democrat, Mr. Cook! The question of a specific criminal statue here isn’t relevant. Congress’ power to impeach and remove is pretty much unlimited. Andrew Johnson’s impeachment, for example, rested on 11 articles, some relating to specific crimes, but check out the 10th and 11th articles here. How about alleging that Johnson acted “to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach” on Congress? It’s not a crime to ridicule Congress, even for the president. But Congress was asserting that Johnson’s efforts to undermine Congress was a breach of his duties under the constitutional. Or think of a hypothetical. What if a president laid up dead drunk every day at the White House or was posting top secret documents on Instagram? Neither of those things would be illegal for the president to do, but both would surely doubt in his or her impeachment. These are political, not legal considerations. Democrats in this case are focusing on the president seeking help from a foreign power against a political opponent, and the Constitution gives them more than enough room to do so.]



“At the risk of being accused of being ‘too cute by a half,’ until Joe Biden receives the Democratic nomination, can he really be considered a ‘political opponent’ for the purpose of prohibiting the President from asking for investigative assistance from a foreign government? Full disclosure – I am a supporter of President Trump.” – Tim Kasparek, Goodyear, Ariz.

SF Gate: “Reptile breeder Brian Gundy had just given a talk and animal presentation Saturday at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in downtown San Jose. While going to get his car parked on the second level of the Fourth and San Fernando Street garage about 4:30 p.m., he left his snakes and lizards in boxes and a bag in a no-parking zone. When he returned for his critters, he made a grim discovery. ‘As I was loading up my gear, I realized the bag that had my four pythons and blue skink lizard inside was gone and they were just there seconds ago,’ Gundy told KTVU Fox 2. Gundy had seen several people walk by his equipment, so he ran after them but couldn't catch up. He told KTVU he doesn't think they knew what was inside. … The stolen animals were worth approximately $5,000, according to the reptile breeder.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who in recent weeks has been surging in the polls in the Democratic presidential primary race, sought Tuesday to clarify another part of her personal story that's been called into question — namely, her claim that she was fired in the 1970s for being pregnant.

Warren has long told the story of how in 1971 she was fired in the first year of her teaching job because she was “visibly pregnant.” It has been presented as a key moment in her story, propelling her toward Harvard and eventually politics.

VIDEO APPEARS TO CONTRADICT WARREN'S SUGGESTION THAT SCHOOL FIRED HER OVER PREGNANCY

But that story was cast into doubt after a 2007 interview reemerged in which she said she left the job after realizing that the education courses that she needed to take weren’t working out for her.

""I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, 'I don't think this is going to work out for me.' I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years and I was really casting about, thinking, 'What am I going to do?'"" she said.

Most recently, The Washington Free Beacon located county records from the local school board, showing that the board in April 1971 voted to extend Warren a second-year contract similar to the one she held the previous year.

A few months later in June, the minutes show that her resignation was “accepted with regret.”

Warren told CBS News on Monday that her life since becoming a senator has caused her to “open up” about different parts of her life as she stood by her account. And on Tuesday, she reiterated her claims that she was pushed out, indicating that while the contract was extended in April when her pregnancy was not visible, that changed a few months later.

“When I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant — and the principal told me the job I'd already been promised for the next year would go to someone else,” she tweeted.

“This was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination — but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.”

Speaking to CBS, she also stood by her claim of being “shown the door” by the principal.

""When someone calls you in and says the job that you've been hired for for the next year is no longer yours, 'we're giving it to someone else,' I think that's being shown the door,"" she said.

This isn’t the first controversy surrounding Warren’s backstory. The beginning of her campaign was dogged by questions about her claim to have Native American heritage.

In February she apologized to Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her ancestry — a test that an analysis found suggested she was between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American.

So far, other 2020 candidates have not taken aim at Warren for either controversy. On Tuesday, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, asked if Warren has an issue with trust, told Fox News that ""we're all going to go through this X-ray of the soul"" and that ""the people who have been consistent and truthful about where they are, are going to stand up well.""

MICHAEL GOODWIN: HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN -- OR GET OVER IT ALREADY

Clinton had sparked speculation about a possible run after she responded a tweet by the president Monday.

""Don't tempt me. Do your job,"" Clinton tweeted back.

Lara Trump said if Clinton ran in 2020, the president would win easily.

""It would be so easy to win but I think it's going to be easy to win with any of these candidates,"" she said. ""You're talking about Elizabeth Warren now, who does look to be, I guess, the best hope they have. Maybe that's why they're trying to bring Hillary back out because they see how bad all these candidates really are.""

The former vice president’s $750 billion higher education plan represents a major expansion of the federal government’s role in educating Americans beyond high school. But Biden’s pitch Tuesday is not as sweeping as proposals from his 2020 rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom offer plans exceeding the $1 trillion mark.

JOE BIDEN UNVEILS NEW STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH GROWING UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

The competing approaches reflect Democrats’ efforts to address spiking tuition costs in the United States and the $1.5 trillion-plus in student debt held by about 45 million Americans. The party’s education policy divide is similar to the gap that separates Biden from the two progressive senators on health care, with the former vice president proposing to expand the federal government’s role in the existing health insurance market, while Warren and Sanders propose a single-payer insurance system that would see the federal government essentially replace private insurance altogether.

Jill Biden, the candidate’s wife and a longtime community college professor, explained her husband’s approach.

“My students inspire me,” she said in a conference call with reporters, “and they ask for one thing in return: opportunity.”

The crux of Biden’s higher education plan is a federal-state partnership to cover community college tuition and technical training. Biden calls for the federal government to cover 75 percent of the tuition costs, with states covering the rest. That’s a similar financing concept to the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and the disabled, with states required to cover some costs to qualify for federal money to cover the majority of the program.

Biden proposes that the federal government cover 95 percent of the community college tuition cost at Native Americans’ tribal campuses.

Sanders and Warren propose universal, free access to all undergraduate public colleges and universities.

On student debt, Biden’s more limited approach calls for doubling the Pell Grant program for low-income Americans and cutting in half the income percentage caps on student loan repayments. Borrowers now must pay up to 10 percent of their discretionary income. Biden calls for capping payments at 5 percent of discretionary income, while also delaying payments for anyone making less than $25,000, with the borrower accruing no additional interest.

Biden’s plan would forgive any remaining debt after 20 years of payments and would allow borrowers to get out of their debts as part of personal bankruptcy.

Sanders, conversely, proposes eliminating all student loan debt, while Warren calls for broad debt relief based on income. Warren’s idea would cancel $50,000 in debt for each person with household income under $100,000, with additional proportional relief for those making up to $250,000 annually.

Biden and Warren have another noticeable split on for-profit colleges, which have come under scrutiny because their graduates have a much higher default rate on loans as they struggle to find quality jobs. Biden proposes tighter regulations on those colleges to stop them “from profiteering off of students.” Warren calls for banning such businesses from getting federal money altogether.

All three Democratic hopefuls point to proposed tax increases to pay for their spending. Sanders would tax Wall Street transactions.

MICHAEL GOODWIN: HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN -- OR GET OVER IT ALREADY

Clinton famously lost the 2016 presidential election after a long and contentious battle during which Trump repeatedly accused her of wrongdoing and suggested he would prosecute her after winning the White House. Clinton, for her part, later described the email controversy as a ""witch hunt.""

Amid Trump's tweet, polling showed a tight race between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden as they vie for the 2020 Democratic nomination.

Clinton previously said that she has advised multiple candidates during the primary race. Her Tuesday tweet fueled speculation that she might try and run, although she's said she wouldn't. In March, a report surfaced that Clinton hadn't completely shut the door on 2020 and was waiting for the release of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

When Trump tweeted about her possible run, Clinton mocked him with a gif from the movie, ""Mean Girls.""

MINNEAPOLIS' LIBERAL MAYOR TRYING TO 'BULLY' PRESIDENT TRUMP OUT OF MINNESOTA, SAYS HEAD OF POLICE UNION

Warren's elevated profile is attracting new scrutiny of her policy ideas, including a 2% annual tax on the wealth of individuals with more than $50 million and a 3% tax on the wealth of those with over $1 billion. Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., has advanced a similar proposal.

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman and a panel of experts debated if the Warren plan was feasible and at the least constitutional.

Lincoln Mitchell, who is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Political Science at Columbia University, said Warren's proposal highlights a critical concept about inequality.

HOUSE DEMS SUBPOENA PENTAGON, WHITE HOUSE BUDGET OFFICE IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

“The argument is a wealth tax as opposed to an income tax, and this is important because we often think about inequality in America in terms of income, but real inequality is in terms of wealth,"" said Mitchell.

However, Mitchell conceded that the idea may not be practical. “One thing I would say is that is it a hard tax to implement. How do you really measure somebody’s worth, particularly a very wealthy person? What’s that jewelry collection worth? What’s that rare car collection worth? So there are some impracticalities.”

Fox News contributor and columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek, dismissed the tax plan outright.

“There are a lot of reasons why this tax is unpopular or a lot of economists think it is a bad idea. Number one, it may be unconstitutional,"" said Peek. ""The way taxation is supposed to be laid out is it is supposed to be proportional across all states and this probably would not be.”

Mitchell disagreed with Peek's assessment, saying, “Taxes aimed at wealthier people… have stood up to constitutional scrutiny in the past.”

Peek was not finished in her takedown of Warren's proposal.

“Number two, it’s expropriation of people’s possessions and property,"" she said, adding, “generally speaking, it’s a terrible tax. It’s inefficient. That’s why most… countries that implemented it in the 90’s have taken it off the books. Sweden, for example, put it in place and saw enormous amounts of people and capital flee the country to get away from it and that’s sort of the expectation.”

“France had 42,000 millionaires leave between 2000 and 2014,"" said Republican New York City Council Member Joe Borelli. ""They lost Gerard Depardieu of all people, someone who is quintessentially French.”

“That woke them up,” joked Peek.

Lastly, Peek said the bottom line is that the idea is impractical. “It’s absolutely hideous to administer because a lot of wealthy people own private partnerships, they own private equity assets… it’s a full-employment act for accountants and lawyers because – as we know from the inheritance tax – those things can be extremely hard to measure.”

Mitchell accepted Peek's argument, but insisted the Americans should consider new ways to address wealth inequality. “This notion of taxing wealth as opposed to income and thinking of inequality in America in terms of wealth… to me, it is very important. I don’t know if this policy as it is presented now gets us there.”

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator.

Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control.

“I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,” Feinstein said in a statement. “During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard-working American families.”

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

She added: “By making gun reform one of the pillars of his campaign and policy platform, Joe Biden demonstrates that he clearly recognizes what is needed to keep Americans safe. And I know, as president, he will continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.”

Feinstein’s endorsement of Biden may seem like a snub to Harris – a first-term senator and former California attorney general – but it hardly comes out of left field, as just last week she held a fundraiser for the former vice president in her home in San Francisco. Also back in January – following Biden’s campaign launch – Feinstein said that “he brings a level of experience and seniority which I think is really important,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

The endorsement from Feinstein – a longtime liberal lawmaker who was first elected in 1992 – comes as Biden is struggling to hold on to his role as Democratic frontrunner. An average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics has Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren virtually tied at the top of the Democratic race.

Warren, however, has surged in recent months in the polls, while Biden has dropped, and far surpassed him during the most recent quarter of fundraising.

Harris, meanwhile, sits in a distant fifth in the Real Clear Politics average, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg."

'WOLF OF WALL STREET' FILM COMPANY TO PAY $60M SETTLEMENT

Belfort’s early life and crimes were portrayed in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Belfort served 22 months in prison between 2004 and 2006 for securities fraud totaling over $200 million. He was also ordered to give back $110 million to investors.

The film was based on a book written by Belfort. He said that becoming sober and writing the book were pivotal experiences on his road to rehabilitation.

“When I wrote the book it was like… self-therapy to look back and examine all your actions… I love the movie—obviously, some things were fictionalized to serve the narrative so to speak… There are some things that bothered me that I thought made me look worse than I was and other things that probably didn't look as bad as I was,” said Belfort on Fox Nation's ""No Interruption.""

The 2013 film reportedly made about $400 million worldwide and contributed to kicking off Belfort’s second career as a motivation speaker.

“In terms of what you did and what brought the charges and what brought the guilty plea -- do you have remorse for that?” asked Lahren.

“Of course, I'm remorseful about what happened,” answered Belfort.

“Do you think jail rehabilitated you in a way? Gave you a chance to reflect?” Lahren pressed.

“I deserved to go to jail… I definitely deserved to go to jail, it was definitely a positive experience,” said Belfort. “I thought the judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really like… I'll never forget—that was terrible. Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.”

Later in the interview, Lahren asked Belfort to weigh in on the current 2020 Democratic field, as leading candidates like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren call for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amuck, it gets really ugly. What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… The policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said.

However, Belfort said that he’s confident that Trump will win in 2020.

“If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, OK? Because I think that this nation would be literally destroyed. If one of these people gets into office—a Warren or Sanders—destruction.”

Lastly, Lahren asked Belfort if he identified with Trump.

“He's a great salesman… I wish that he would say things in a way that p*** people off less because it doesn't help… but I can’t judge because he's president. I didn't become president, he did. I went to jail.”

The network said it would wait to announce the format, moderators, and specific location but did announce it would host the debate in cooperation with The Washington Post.

It also commented on which Democrats appeared to qualify for the debate. As of Tuesday, the field included former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

For the fifth debate, Democratic candidates need to receive 165,000 unique donors -- including 600 spread out over 20 states -- and reach 3 percent in ""four qualifying state or national polls."" They can also make the stage with 5 percent in two qualifying state polls.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

According to the announcement, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have yet to meet the polling requirements.

NBC hosted the first Democratic primary debate in June with anchors Chuck Todd, Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt, Jose Diaz-Balart, and Rachel Maddow. That debate sparked an early controversy between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who also qualified for the fifth debate, after the former made controversial comments about racial issues.

Since June, the 2020 field has narrowed but at least 12 remained and qualified for the fourth debate set to take place in Ohio. That debate will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times on Oct. 15. Given the much smaller field, NBC can apparently avoid the two-night format of the first debate.

The DNC announced that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by the deadline.

TIME FOR A RE-PETE?

What’s so great about fourth place?



If you’re South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, quite a lot actually.



Readers have no doubt been watching Elizabeth Warren’s steady gains against front-runner Joe Biden in recent weeks. She is now just 2.4 points behind Biden in our Democratic 2020 Power Ranking. As Biden continues to struggle with the enhanced scrutiny on his family’s buck raking facilitated by Biden’s proximity to power, we expect his troubles to continue.



While Democrats are loath to publically agree with President Trump, the facts of the case of Trump’s likely impeachment reinforce Biden’s strongest negatives: That he has been around too long and is too much of a swamp creature.



We know Biden supporters are preparing to spend millions to prop up the former Delaware senator in his third presidential quest, but it is hard to imagine that Biden could persist for long in second place.



When electability is your cri de coeur it’s hard to keep voters around when you don’t look so electable.



This is good news for Warren, no doubt. But she had better be worried that it is good news come too soon. As Biden is currently experiencing, being the frontrunner is not all aviator sunglasses and waffle cones.



Warren has long enjoyed kid-glove treatment from the press, with relatively little scrutiny on her very ambitious policy proposals. She has also gotten a couple of mulligans on biographical boo-boos. That won’t last if she gets out in front. The steady diet of opposition research that will fill reporters’ inboxes will see to that.



So cast your eyes down the list. You can skip over poor Bernie Sanders who is struggling not just with his own health issues, but with the tragic loss of his daughter-in-law. The Vermont senator has said he will scale back his campaigning, and is already 10 points behind Warren and falling.



Buttigieg, though, has been climbing. Perhaps the beneficiary of the unraveling of California Sen. Kamala Harris’ misbegotten campaign or perhaps some Biden skeptics defecting, Buttigieg is a man on the move.



Certainly Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are hoping that they would see their boats lifted by the melting of Biden’s iceberg, but Buttigieg may have the best case to make.



His fundraising haul in the third quarter says that he will have the resources to go the distance and his moderate-sounding appeal to voters would position him nicely to pick up the business-friendly Democratic donors who are terrified of either a Warren defeat or victory.



Whether Buttigieg can capitalize on the opportunity will depend on his ability to go toe-to-toe with Warren. In the first Buttigieg craze, he wasn’t able to translate interest into hard support. In a second go-around he’d have to play for keeps.



SANDERS TO SCALE BACK CAMPAIGN AFTER HEART SURGERY

WaPo: “[Bernie Sanders] visited a cardiologist Tuesday morning, and when he returned, he told reporters, ‘We’re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit.’ ‘Probably not doing four rallies a day,’ said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents. Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at ‘the appropriate time.’ Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records.”



Daughter-in-law, 46, killed by rare cancer - USA Today: “The daughter-in-law of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has died, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. Rainè Riggs was 46. The Lee & Martin Funeral Home in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, says Riggs died Saturday, the day Sanders returned to Vermont after suffering a heart attack. Her obituary said she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. Riggs, a neuropsychologist, was married to Levi Sanders, who ran unsuccessfully for a New Hampshire congressional seat in 2018. Riggs' obituary says she met Levi Sanders while the two worked at an emergency food shelter in Vermont. The obituary said Riggs was the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School for several years, and she started the Palliative Care Department for Dartmouth Medical Center. She also owned Riggs Geriatric Psychology in Windsor, Vermont. Riggs and Sanders had three children.”

TIME OUT: ‘YESTERDAY’ CAME SUDDENLY

On this day in 1965, The Beatles’ “Yesterday” began its month-long reign as the top single in the U.S. The song, Paul McCartney’s masterwork, started as a dream. The Telegraph [U.K.]: “As McCartney explained in 1980: ‘I woke up with a lovely tune in my head. I thought, 'That’s great, I wonder what that is?' There was an upright piano next to me, to the right of the bed by the window. I got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th – and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot but because I’d dreamed it I couldn’t believe I’d written it. I thought, ‘No, I’ve never written like this before.’ But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing.’ McCartney was living in Wimpole Street, London, at the time, at the family home of Jane Asher, who he was dating at the time.”

TRUMP’S IMPEACHMENT PLAN: BURN DOWN THE HOUSE

Axios: “President Trump, while nervous about the historic stain of impeachment, is throwing everything he has into this fight: refusing all cooperation, running ads to profit politically, and torching every person who stands in opposition to him. When it all boils down, Trump really only trusts his own instincts. And his instincts here are the same as they were with the Mueller investigation: Fight like hell. No nuance or apology — not a hint of it. Turn the leader of the investigation (in this case, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff) into a conservative media villain. Condemn Trump enemies in the most incendiary and exaggerated language possible (treason, traitors, coup, etc.). Compared to the Mueller investigation, the Ukraine phone call appears to have more resonance with the general public. Republicans close to leadership and the White House tell Axios they're concerned by trend lines in a Washington Post poll showing 49% of Americans think Trump should be removed from office.”



Partisan lines holding - NBC News: “A majority of Americans say the allegations that President Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden are serious and need to be fully investigated, and they also believe the president hasn’t been honest and truthful about his actions. Still, the public is divided – largely along partisan lines – on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 43 percent supporting his removal given what they know today, versus 49 percent who oppose it. … According to the poll, 47 percent of Americans believe the allegations that Trump requested Ukraine’s president to look into the Bidens are either ‘quite serious’ or ‘extremely serious.’ That includes 73 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and even 21 percent of Republicans. By contrast, a combined 28 percent dismiss the allegations as either being not serious or false and without merit. Twenty-five percent of respondents say they don’t have an opinion or are unsure.”



Q Poll: Support for impeachment inquiry steady - Quinnipiac University: “After another week with impeachment in the news, registered voters nationwide are still divided on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, with 45 percent saying he should be impeached and removed and 49 percent opposing the idea, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. This compares to last week's poll, in which voters were evenly split on impeaching and removing the president 47 - 47 percent. In a poll released on September 25, before any major news about impeachment, voters were clearly against impeachment 37 - 57 percent. While nearly half of voters do not currently back impeachment, a majority of voters do still approve 53 - 43 percent of the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the U.S. House of Representatives in order to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against the president. A week ago, voters approved of the inquiry 52 - 45 percent.”



Gowdy joins Team Trump - Bloomberg: “Donald Trump has enlisted former Representative Trey Gowdy to work with the White House team combating the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry into the president, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Gowdy, a former prosecutor from South Carolina, is not formally joining the White House staff, according to the people. He was at the White House on Tuesday, according to one person who saw him there, before an eight-page letter was issued to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declaring that Trump and the administration wouldn’t participate in the impeachment inquiry.”



What will become of Mick Mulvaney? - The Atlantic: “[Mick] Mulvaney’s uncertain status says something about Trump’s mind-set. In the face of this latest peril, and nearly 1,000 days into his tenure, he still hasn’t settled on how the West Wing should run. Confronting the impeachment threat is a West Wing staff that Trump has largely neutered. Aides have been left guessing about who’s coming and going, much less what they’re supposed to say about accusations that Trump pressured Ukraine to ferret out dirt on his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden. In the two weeks since the whistle-blower complaint was released to the public, the White House still hasn’t articulated a clear legal, political, or communications strategy needed to withstand impeachment and keep Trump’s Republican support from eroding.”



Watergate lessons for GOP - FiveThirtyEight: “One complicating factor here is that if Republicans were to abandon Trump, history does not suggest that Trump loyalists would easily forgive them for joining the Democrats’ impeachment effort. Even though most Americans did eventually support removing [Richard] Nixon from office, Republican voters were mostly not part of that consensus. Days before he resigned, a Gallup poll found that only 31 percent of Republicans thought Nixon should no longer be president. And some of those supporters deeply resented their representatives for their role in ousting Nixon, which may even have contributed to the Democratic landslide in the 1974 midterm elections.”



SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN ARM RAISES RECORD CASH

WashEx: “The committee tasked with electing Republican senators amid the impeachment battle will report raising $47.7 million so far this year, an amount that is already greater than ever raised before in the year prior to an election year. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is crucial to protecting vulnerable incumbents like Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Martha McSally of Arizona. In the three-month period ending Sept. 30, the NRSC raised roughly $13.1 million, including approximately $5 million in September — and made the last payment on a $17 million debt left over from the midterm elections. The NRSC shared these figures with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, ahead of its upcoming Federal Election Commission filing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying maintain Republican control of the Senate. Currently there are 53 GOP senators in the conference.”



Planned Parenthood preps massive 2020 spending - Fox News: “Planned Parenthood, the behemoth nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care and is the nation’s largest abortion provider, says it’s making a major investment in the 2020 elections. Planned Parenthood’s political wings – which fight for legal protections for abortion – announced Wednesday that they’ll spend $45 million backing candidates who support abortion rights in elections next year ranging from the state house level to the White House. … The group says its top priority in 2020 is to defeat and unseat President Trump. Other priorities include helping Democrats retake control of the GOP-controlled Senate and holding the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. The group will target roughly 5 million voters across the country, with the spotlight on nine key swing states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.”



Bevin looks to impeachment backlash to hold on in Kentucky - RCP: “[Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin] has pressed the pending impeachment of President Trump into his own Kentucky reelection effort. Standing outside the governor’s mansion on Friday, Bevin tied his fate to Trump’s by condemning impeachment as ‘an absolute travesty’ and calling on his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Andy Beshear, to answer a ‘fundamental question’: Will Beshear support or oppose forcing the president from office? The Democrat doesn’t want to answer, and the ensuing drama in a 2019 race could draw a rough sketch of the electoral implications of impeachment in 2020.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I appreciate Ellen DeGeneres’ statement about her friendship with former President George W. Bush. How have we reached this point where we can’t be friends with, or at least be civil to, those who hold a different viewpoint? … The father of Christian Rock, Larry Norman, once told a joke about witnessing to people and the ‘religious’ terminology that is often used. In the story, the Christian becomes frustrated at the end of a conversation he’s been having with a friend because the friend doesn’t understand the terms justification, sanctification, or being saved. In frustration he shouts, ‘I’m trying to tell you the Good News!’ His friend asks, ‘What’s that?’ The Christian responds, ‘You’re going to Hell!’ To which his friend replies, ‘Well, what’s the bad news?’ The point of recounting that is to state that if we hold firm convictions, that’s fine, but we need to convey them in a loving and respectful way. Our actions speak louder than our words. If we’re not mindful of that, we risk offending the person, or worse, losing the opportunity for dialogue that we seek with the other person. I believe that in matters of faith especially, that would be a bad thing. As always, I wish you and your family God’s richest blessings!” – Paul Schnier, Shoreham, N.Y.



[Ed. note: Amen, Mr. Schnier! That goes for politics, too. Persuasion leads to consensus, which leads to durable reforms. Division leads to government by plurality, which leads to lurching. Blessings to you and yours, too.]



“I fully understand your point today about the legal (‘shoot someone on 5th Ave’) and political differences (‘posting TS documents on IG’) when viewing Congress' vested powers to impeach a sitting President. Hopefully this third time is a charm. What about this [Contributions and donations by foreign nationals.] I believe this is what your colleague Judge [Andrew Napolitano] has been referencing in his argument on recent articles and TV shows. … The difference between this and the Mueller/Russia case was that this bordered on bribery in ‘bribes, high crimes and misdemeanors.’ Mueller's case was weak and bordered on emotion. This is a stronger case with a self-admitted crime, No? An independent voter's perspective.” – Jai Suresh, Fremont, Calif.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Suresh. But, no matter which side you take here, the question of impeachment still isn’t about the law. The question is political, or at best, moral. It is what the members of the House (and the constituents they represent) say it is. Efforts to find specific criminal charges miss the point of the endeavor.]

EAU DE BIG BOY

AP: “An Ohio homeowner never envisioned becoming semi-famous because of a goat butting its way into her home and taking a nap in her bathroom. … The break-in happened Friday when an escaped male goat from a farm several miles away repeatedly butted against a sliding glass door... [Jennifer Keathley’s] 18-year-old son, Logan, discovered the billy goat in the bathroom when he returned home Friday afternoon from school to find the family’s agitated German Shepherd in the driveway, broken glass on the back porch and the house reeking. … Two Ashland County Sheriff’s deputies unsuccessfully tried to coax the goat, named Big Boy, out of the home with carrots, a dog bone and grass. They eventually grabbed him by the horns and dragged him outside… The Keathleys learned their home insurance policy covers damage from bears and deer but not goats. … Despite applications of carpet deodorant and urine neutralizer, she said the odor from Big Boy’s urine still lingers.”

“Or more prosaically, the catastrophe that awaits everyone from a single false move, wrong turn, fatal encounter. Every life has such a moment. What distinguishes us is whether — and how — we ever come back.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Aug. 17, 2007.

The shooting took place around 2:30 a.m., police said in a press release. At that time, the store was open because of overnight construction, Fox 4 reported.

A police spokesman said the store’s back door was open so construction workers could go in and out. The suspect, clad in body armor and armed with an assault rifle, entered the rear of the building “in an attempt to commit a robbery,” Sgt. Warren Mitchell said.

The burglar then allegedly tried to disarm a security guard who was sitting by the door. The security guard pulled out his weapon and fired “multiple shots at the suspect,” Mitchell said.

The burglar fled the store but collapsed in an alley. He was taken to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead, police said.

The letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray -- signed by GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee -- came as Democrats have sought to relitigate the Kavanaugh issue, with virtually all of the party's 2020 presidential contenders calling for the justice to be impeached.

The first criminal referral, the senators wrote, concerned the ""false allegation made by an individual who told the [Judiciary] Committee that he had direct knowledge that Judge Kavanaugh assaulted a close friend on a boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island in 1985.""

The Twitter account belonging to that accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration. The accuser, who had contacted the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later, after an investigation by Senate Republicans.

NEW YORK TIMES UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' WITH ONE MINOR DETAIL -- 'ACCUSER' HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF ALLEGED EPISODE

The second referral involved a claim from disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and client Julie Swetnick, alleging that Kavanaugh participated in gang-rape trains.

""After a thorough investigation, the committee found no verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations made in the declaration,"" the senators wrote. ""The committee also found that both Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick had a long history of credibility issues and may have criminally conspired to mislead the committee and obstruct its investigation.""

EX-BOYFRIEND TELLS FOX NEWS THAT SWETNICK THREATENED TO KILL UNBORN CHILD, ALWAYS EXAGGERATED STORIES

The third referral specifically implicated Avenatti, who submitted a ""sworn statement by an unknown declarant claimed that Judge Kavanaugh had spiked the punch at house parties with Quaaludes and/or grain alcohol."" NBC News later reported that the apparent declarant had said Avenatti ""twisted her words.""

The final referral concerned a claim by Judy Munro-Leighton, who had sent an email to the Judiciary Committee indicating that she was ""the author of an unsigned letter containing highly graphic sexual-assault accusations against Judge Kavanaugh previously received by the office of Senator Kamala Harris."" But, when committee staff later interviewed her, ""she admitted that she falsely identified herself as the author of the letter and its allegations and had only claimed authorship 'as a way to grab attention.'""

The letter added: ""When asked by committee investigators if she had ever met Judge Kavanaugh, she said: 'Oh Lord, no.'""

'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS

In the process of evaluating claims against Kavanaugh, the senators wrote that committee investigators ""collected 25 written statements and spoke with 45 individuals,"" and those investigations ""culminated in the nominee’s confirmation and the release of a 414-page committee report concluding that there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations.""

The senators asked Wray and Barr to provide an update by Oct. 21. Specifically, the senators requested to know ""for each criminal referral made by the committee to the FBI, did the FBI open a criminal investigation? If so, which investigation(s) resulted in a referral to the Justice Department for prosecution? If not, why not?""

Additionally, the senators asked: ""For each case that was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution, which cases were rejected and which were accepted for prosecution?""

""The next Supreme Court nominee should not have to defend himself or herself against baseless and fabricated allegations, and committee staff should not have to spend valuable time investigating them,"" the senators concluded.

The cancellation comes one day after a similar event featuring the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets was canceled.

The teams remain scheduled to play a pair of preseason games in China, planned for Thursday morning and Saturday morning, Eastern U.S. time, amid speculation that Chinese officials or possibly the NBA might postpone those events as well. At least one U.S. lawmaker, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has called on the league to pull out.

NBA-CHINA CONTROVERSY EXPOSED HOW DEPENDENT AMERICAN BASKETBALL IS ON BEIJING, FS1'S JASON WHITLOCK SAYS

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was heading to Shanghai on Wednesday in an effort to repair the league's relationship with China, according to the Associated Press. He said he did not expect the Lakers-Nets games to be canceled.

""But if those are the consequences of us adhering to our values, I still feel it's very, very important to adhere to those values,"" Silver said.

Photos posted on social media showed Lakers stars -- including LeBron James and Anthony Davis -- outside a facility where the team held a practice that was off-limits to the media, according to reports.

The NBA later postponed scheduled media sessions for both teams.

NBA Cares is the charity arm of the 30-team league that supports numerous causes, such as education and disaster relief.

But the two teams’ goodwill visit to the country has been overshadowed by a controversy sparked by a now-deleted Twitter message posted by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who expressed support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong who have been opposing what they view as Chinese interference in the island territory’s autonomy.

The tweet was especially offensive in China because the Rockets were the team of Yao Ming, a Shanghai native who played in the NBA from 2002 to 2011 and is considered the sport’s greatest ambassador in his home country. Several Chinese companies immediately cut ties with the Rockets.

Team star James Harden, who was with the Rockets in Japan, in a separate trip from the Lakers-Nets visit in China, apologized Monday on behalf of the organization.

""We apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,"" Harden said, according to ESPN. ""For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.""

Hong Kong has been a special administrative region of China since 1997, when Britain relinquished control.

Morey’s tweet also placed the NBA in the position of having to choose between supporting the free-speech values of the United States and pursuing business in China, a communist nation that ranks as the world’s No. 2 economy.

Not long after the tweet appeared, Silver said at a news conference that the league was “apologetic” over the fallout, but was “not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of speech."" Silver added that he “regrets” how so many Chinese people and NBA fans were upset by Morey's message.

""Daryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,"" Silver said, according to the Associated Press. ""What I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.""

Nevertheless, the league faced bipartisan criticism for its initial response.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., blasted the league as “hypocrites,” saying its players “have no problem speaking out on politics & social issues in America. But they apologize to #China for a pro democracy tweet from an NBA team executive.”

“We’re better than this,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote. “Human rights shouldn’t be for sale & the NBA shouldn’t be assisting Chinese communist censorship.

On Monday, presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote:

“China is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles – and our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights.""

Other critics noted that normally outspoken figures in the NBA – such as Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, and star Lakers player LeBron James, have been largely silent on the controversy.

The NBA regular season is scheduled to begin Oct. 22

Campos-Duffy's advice for parents was sparked by her recent visit to Marquette University in Wisconsin where she was invited by Young America’s Foundation club (YAF) to speak about the importance of defending American capitalism.

She was confronted by campus protesters and she wrote about it in an op-ed published on Fox Business.

In the piece, Campos-Duffy recalled that she was prepared for her critics, but she was taken by surprise by a Chinese foreign exchange student, who stood up and ""taught all of us that night a lesson in the dangers of romanticizing socialism and communism.""

""After asking a thoughtful question, I asked him if he would explain to the students in the room how the Chinese social credit system worked,"" she wrote.

""He described how the Communist Chinese government tracks its citizens’ phones, internet use, attendance to Communist party events and other activities and uses this 'score' to determine your family’s financial fate, the quality of education your child receives, and whether you will be arrested or punished for thinking the wrong thoughts. I was alarmed by how many of the students in the room were unaware of this fact of life in Communist China.""

On ""Fox and Friends,"" Campos-Duffy said that she came away from that experience with the conviction that parents must step up to teach their children, when educators, politicians and public figures do not.

""What I found on college campuses is -- with the exception of a few ... conservative students -- so many kids are falling for the lies and the promises of 'free'... that are being sold today by [New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], by [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders and by [Massachusetts Sen.] Elizabeth Warren,"" said Campos-Duffy.

""The question is what do you do about it? And my experience is that you have to start young -- you can't wait until your kids come home with the stories from their socialist professors at the university. If you're not having a conversation with your young kids at home then somebody else is,"" she concluded.

Campos-Duffy also previewed an important new episode of her Fox Nation show, ""Moms,"" where she interviews women of all different backgrounds about the challenges of motherhood.

""We actually travel to Texas to meet with real-life moms there, who are dealing with fertility issues, so it's a really heavy topic, but so much hope, so much love and compassion that was shared inside of that story... More people than we think are struggling with this, so its a topic that we really wanted to touch on,"" Campos-Duffy told ""Fox and Friends"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt.

In that episode, which will be available on Fox Nation on October 10, one mother shared her heartbreaking story of turning to in vitro fertilization after the death of her first child.

""We learned about mid-way through our pregnancy that she had some physical abnormalities that led them to believe that there may be genetic abnormalities as wel l... unfortunately when she was born she had a rare lung disease that she passed from, "" she said. ""In order to avoid that happening again and not have to make a choice with each pregnancy, we decided to do IVF -- which led us to our second daughter Avery, and she's 10 months old now.""

* A national Quinnipiac poll released yesterday found Elizabeth Warren holding onto her narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, 29% to 26%. Bernie Sanders was third with 16%, and no other candidate topped 5%.

* The same poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up by 11 points (51% to 40%), Warren leading Trump by eight points (49% to 41%), and Sanders leading him by seven points (49% to 42%).

* Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang was at 3% in the Quinnipiac poll, which means he’s now the eighth candidate to qualify for the Democrats’ presidential primary debate in November.

* On a related note, we learned yesterday that MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Nov. 20 in Georgia. As NBC News’ report on this added, “The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.”

* With just a few days remaining ahead of Louisiana’s first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, the latest Emerson poll found Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) leading the field with 48% – which is awfully close to the 50% threshold he’d need to avoid a runoff and serve a second term. Eddie Rispone (R) was second in the poll with 25%, followed by Ralph Abraham (R) at 19%.

* At home in Vermont yesterday, Bernie Sanders told reporters that in the wake of his heart attack that he’ll have to “change the nature of the campaign a bit.” The independent senator suggested the shift will mean holding fewer campaign events.

* Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is nothing if not shameless, his re-election campaign yesterday began promoting a Politico article pointing to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s alleged favoritism for Kentucky. Chao, of course, is McConnell’s wife. “Mitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset,” the senator’s team wrote in a tweet highlighting the report.

* Probate judge Steven Reed (D) made history yesterday, becoming the first African-American mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.

* And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) has thrown her endorsement to Joe Biden, looking past her fellow California senator, Kamala Harris. Feinstein had previously indicated support for Biden in January, but that was before most of the Democratic candidates had formally launched their campaigns. Biden now has five endorsements from sitting U.S. senators, more than any other Democratic candidate."

Arnold Schwarzenegger said Monday that he ""could"" vote for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in the 2020 presidential election.

""I would just have to see what her program is, what her vision is for the future of America because I think the most important thing is we keep America number one,” Schwarzenegger told ""The Howard Stern Show,"" according to The Hill.

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BELIEVES DONALD TRUMP IS 'IN LOVE' WITH HIM: 'HE WANTS TO BE ME'

When asked whether he would support President Trump's reelection in 2020, Schwarzenegger laughed and said: ""I doubt it.""

""I will find out what is happening on the Democratic side because, I mean, there's a lot of weird stuff going on there,"" the Austria-born actor added.

The 72-year-old Schwarzenegger has engaged in a long-standing feud with President Trump, who Schwarzenegger replaced as host of NBC's ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2015. Last month, Schwarzenegger said that Trump wanted to be him and was ""in love"" with him.

“I don’t think he fears me,"" the former ""Terminator"" star said during an interview. ""But I remember that in the old days when we went to the wrestling matches, the way he admired people with bodies, and the way they would jump around in the ring, and to perform physical stunts and stuff like that — he had great admiration for that.""

The announcement came in a campaign video posted to Twitter, which shows the Massachusetts senator visiting a neighborhood in southwest Detroit, often referred to as the most polluted area in Michigan, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who represents the district. In the clip, Warren speaks to community members about residents who have been diagnosed with cancer linked to exposure to toxins after years of living in the shadow of a massive oil refinery.

WARREN FACING SCRUTINY OVER CLAIM SHE WAS FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT

In line with her overarching campaign to end corruption in Washington, Warren calls the pollution in these communities a result of “decades of discrimination and environmental racism,” saying it is “unacceptable and it must change.”

The plan, which has been posted to her website, builds upon policies covering everything from affordable housing to green manufacturing to clean energy. She stresses the need to build “strong, resilient communities” by doing more than just “cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.”

According to the campaign, this would mean identifying the most at-risk communities and requiring all federal agencies to consider the climate impact of any proposed projects. Warren also calls for investing in the nation’s public water systems, ending the privatization of those systems and enforcing water quality standards.

The plan is vague on how exactly the $1 trillion would be spent, but also calls for grants to long-term residents of ""redlined"" communities that were once discriminated against financially ""so that they can buy homes in the neighborhood of their choice and start to build wealth.""

Warren's plan is one of many multitrillion-dollar commitments from the Democratic field that have raised questions over how they would be funded. Her climate policy claims that an added corporate profit tax, as well as reversing part of the Trump administration's tax cuts, would finance the programs.

WARREN SLIPS AHEAD OF BIDEN IN LATEST POLL

Warren also vows to get tough on polluting companies. This includes reinstituting the Superfund Waste Tax, which ensures hazardous waste sites are properly cleaned up and expired in 1995. “Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions — not leave them for the communities to clean up. I’ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess,” she says.

Warren’s environmental justice policy comes ahead of a campaign swing through South Carolina, California, and Nevada later in the week."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she is committed to forgoing big-money fundraisers if she wins the Democratic nomination, no matter how much money President Trump pulls in from his supporters.

""I’m not going to go do the big-dollar fund-raisers. I’m just not going to do it,” Warren told CBS in an interview posted Tuesday. The 2020 hopeful said that her campaign was predicated on the notion ""that we can build this together. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.”

CBS reporter Zak Hudak had asked Warren whether she could guarantee her supporters she wouldn't utilize big-dollar fundraisers.

Warren claimed that without financial independence, candidates would continue serving wealthy interests after they were elected to office.

DEMS PUBLICLY TOUT SMALL DOLLAR DONATIONS WHILE QUIETLY COURTING BIG DOLLAR DONORS

""I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,” Warren said. “Look, for me, this is pretty straightforward. Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible.

""Or you think it’s about a grass-roots, let’s build this from the ground up.”

That answer appeared to represent a reversal for Warren after she expressed openness to big-dollar donors in a general election. Not doing so, she indicated, was ""unilateral disarmament.""

""We’ll be up against a Republican machine that will be hell-bent on keeping the White House,"" she told MSNBC in February. ""They will have PACs and Super PACs and too many special interest groups to count, and we will do what is necessary to match them financially. That means investing -- starting now -- in each and every one of our state parties, and in our national party too.”

It's unclear what was behind Warren's apparent reversal but her comments came just days after her campaign announced it had raised $24.6 million from more than half a million individual donors in the third quarter of this year. That was substantially higher than the $15.2 million raised by former Vice President Joe Biden but slightly lower than the $25.3 million raised by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

If Warren wins the Democratic nomination, she would likely face an incumbent candidate backed by a Republican Party that has recorded record-breaking fundraising numbers.

In the third quarter alone, the Republican National Committee and President Trump's campaign raised $125 million. Within just 24 hours in September, those two entities raked in an eye-popping $5 million -- an apparent backlash to the formal impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. So far in 2019, those two organizations have raised $308 million.

The new national poll showed Warren, a Massachusetts senator, holding a slight edge – but within the margin of error – over the former vice president in the race for their party’s 2020 nomination.

The poll, released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University, was the latest in a slew of national and early voting state surveys in recent weeks showing Warren has surged to a virtual tie with Biden in the primary battle.

""They're always nervous and they want Biden to be more combative. From your perspective, they want him to really go after Trump in a vicious way, and Biden is just not their guy right now.

Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June.

The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.

Biden retains top billing with strong support among non-whites, voters over age 45, and moderates/conservatives. Warren has strengthened her position by increasing support among suburban voters, very liberals, and men.

When Democratic primary voters’ first and second choice preferences are considered together, Biden and Warren tie at 45 percent support, Sanders is at 34 percent, Harris 15 percent and Buttigieg 13 percent.

President Trump’s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden’s support in the primary race -- and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020: 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month. Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders.

At the same time, the poll finds the three top Democratic candidates with sizable leads over the president in potential head-to-head matchups.

The poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent). This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8.

“If Warren continues to poll as strongly against Trump as the former vice president, it makes it increasingly difficult for the Biden team to keep making the argument he is the most electable candidate,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw.

The impeachment inquiry hasn’t caused any real shifts in the ballot test, as Trump’s support in the two-way matchups has been between 37-42 percent all year. However, the poll finds an 8-point shift since last month in the number expecting Trump will be re-elected. In September, more thought he would win by a 6-point margin and now more expect he won’t by 2 points.

And while most Republican primary voters want to keep Trump as their party’s nominee, nearly one in five, 17 percent, would like to see someone else run.

“So far, Trump has been able to keep his Republican base on board,” says Shaw. “If the percentage opposing his re-nomination creeps into the 20s, that would be a troubling sign.”

Meanwhile, voters continue to believe Donald Trump is dishonest. Sixty-three percent say that -- far more than the 35 percent who think he is honest and trustworthy. By the way, that’s the same number who said Trump was honest before he won the 2016 election.

Vice President Mike Pence does a bit better than his boss, although not by much: 39 percent say he’s honest and 54 percent say dishonest.

On the other side, each of the top three Democratic candidates receives positive ratings on this measure. Sanders performs best with 59 percent saying he is honest and trustworthy (36 percent disagree). Fifty percent think Warren is honest vs. 44 percent dishonest, and for Biden voters split 48-47 percent.

Among Democrats, 87 percent think Sanders is honest and trustworthy, while 81 percent feel that way about Warren and 75 percent Biden. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump is honest.

Currently, 51 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Sanders, while 43 percent view him negatively. That puts him in positive territory by 8 points. More view Warren positively by 7 points (46 favorable vs. 39 unfavorable) and Biden by 6 (50 favorable vs. 44 unfavorable).

The ratings are closer to even for Buttigieg (+3 points), Yang (+3), Booker (-2), Harris (-3) and O’Rourke (-4). They each also have large numbers who have never heard of them or have no opinion of them. For example, 43 percent of voters are unable to rate Yang, while 36 percent can’t rate Buttigieg and 32 percent can’t rate Booker.

Voters view Trump more negatively than positively by 13 points (43-56). His personal favorable rating was underwater by 22 points in the days leading up to the 2016 election (38-60).

Twice as many primary voters say Trump’s allegations make them more likely to vote for Biden (21 percent more vs. 10 percent less), while twice as many say health concerns make them less (31 percent) rather than more likely (15 percent) to vote for Sanders in the primary.

Sanders is off the campaign trail since suffering a heart attack October 3. He’s 78 years old, while Biden is 76, Trump is 73, and Warren is 70.

Conducted October 6-8, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,003 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

She stresses the need to build “strong, resilient communities” by doing more than just “cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.”

Bovard cited an estimate by the Manhattan Institute's Brian Riedl, who claimed that the aggregate cost of Warren’s plans would be $38-48 trillion and would require a middle-class tax since a wealth tax would not be able to pay for it all. The most expensive of Warren's proposals is a 'Medicare-for-all' health care system,which she has promised will cover all Americans.

“If you just do the math, even with a wealth tax, you’re only raising a fifth of what her aggregate policy proposals will cost,” Bovard said.

Bovard said Warren has refused to answer questions about how the plans will be funded, including in a recent interview with ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert.

However, her pregnant-victim story fell apart when school board records obtained by the Free Beacon showed the school offered her a new contract. She quit anyway — backing up the tale she told in 2007, when she said she left by choice.

Of course, all politicians lie.

Those who say they don't are lying too.

Warren's lies, however, fit a pattern. It's victim karaoke — an opportunistic deception to exploit the plight of others.

It's no different than parking in a handicapped space and faking a limp.

It's fraud.

Now Liz claims her Native American ruse was an honest mistake, but it still got her favorable press as the first minority woman in Harvard Law — a story so heavily promoted both by her and Harvard.

Clinton appeared on PBS News Hour and was asked about Trump's antagonistic attitude toward her after he goaded Clinton to run for the White House again. She called him ""obsessed"" for mocking her email scandal and said she could beat Trump in an electoral rematch, if she ever decided to jump back in.

""It truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me,"" she said. ""But this latest tweet is so typical of him. Nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails. We all know that. So he's either lying or delusional or both.

""So maybe there does need to be a rematch,"" Clinton added. ""Obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don't understand, I don't think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.""

Clinton, who defeated Trump in the popular vote in 2016, also responded to the challenge on Twitter after Trump called her out by name, suggesting she try to steal the nomination away from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

""I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition.

'WOLF OF WALL STREET' FILM COMPANY TO PAY $60M SETTLEMENT

Belfort’s early life and crimes were portrayed in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Belfort served 22 months in prison between 2004 and 2006 for securities fraud totaling over $200 million. He was also ordered to give back $110 million to investors.

The film was based on a book written by Belfort. He said that becoming sober and writing the book were pivotal experiences on his road to rehabilitation.

“When I wrote the book it was like… self-therapy to look back and examine all your actions… I love the movie—obviously, some things were fictionalized to serve the narrative so to speak… There are some things that bothered me that I thought made me look worse than I was and other things that probably didn't look as bad as I was,” said Belfort on Fox Nation's ""No Interruption.""

The 2013 film reportedly made about $400 million worldwide and contributed to kicking off Belfort’s second career as a motivation speaker.

“In terms of what you did and what brought the charges and what brought the guilty plea -- do you have remorse for that?” asked Lahren.

“Of course, I'm remorseful about what happened,” answered Belfort.

“Do you think jail rehabilitated you in a way? Gave you a chance to reflect?” Lahren pressed.

“I deserved to go to jail… I definitely deserved to go to jail, it was definitely a positive experience,” said Belfort. “I thought the judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really like… I'll never forget—that was terrible. Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.”

Later in the interview, Lahren asked Belfort to weigh in on the current 2020 Democratic field, as leading candidates like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren call for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amuck, it gets really ugly. What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… The policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said.

However, Belfort said that he’s confident that Trump will win in 2020.

“If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, OK? Because I think that this nation would be literally destroyed. If one of these people gets into office—a Warren or Sanders—destruction.”

Lastly, Lahren asked Belfort if he identified with Trump.

“He's a great salesman… I wish that he would say things in a way that p*** people off less because it doesn't help… but I can’t judge because he's president. I didn't become president, he did. I went to jail.”

Sanders said Wednesday on ""The Story"" that as a Delaware senator, former Vice President Joe Biden urged congressional restraint in two past impeachment inquiries and had done so with Trump until recently.

""It's a fair question -- why today and why now?"" Sanders opened by saying, in reference to Biden telling a New Hampshire crowd earlier Wednesday he now backs impeaching Trump.

""I think the acts of the last 15 days are what moved Vice President Biden to this position. Fifteen days ago, Vice President Biden was in Wilmington, Delaware, and he gave a statement.

""He said if Donald Trump and the Trump administration did not cooperate with Congress' investigation that they constitutionally have the right to do, then this would be a tragedy of Donald Trump's own making.""

BIDEN, FOR FIRST TIME, CALLS FOR TRUMP TO BE IMPEACHED

The president has since indicated the administration will not cooperate with the House's ongoing impeachment inquiry, claiming it is illegitimate.

Sanders said that when Biden was in the U.S. Senate, he served during impeachment inquiries into ex-Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, while Clinton was impeached by the House but a Senate vote did not garner enough support to remove him from office.

""There is a process and a system,"" she said.

""It has been a remarkable time in American politics and political history,"" Sanders added.

Sanders continued, saying a whistleblower complaint and accompanying Trump phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed an open invitation to a foreign government to interfere in U.S. elections.

Sanders rejected a question from host Martha MacCallum as to whether Biden's slippage in Democratic primary polls against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., spurred him to support impeachment."

""Her only opponent is Liz Warren.""

Watters claimed Warren would have to be chosen as her running mate in order for the former secretary of state to have a shot at the party nomination.

He said Clinton could convince Democratic voters by reminding them she beat Trump in the popular vote and in other categories other than the actual elector tally.

""I outraised him, I out-debated him, I could beat him again if I just go to Wisconsin,"" Watters said, imitating what Clinton would say.

Watters said Sanders would have to be guaranteed a cabinet nomination, in order for Clinton to gain the support of the Vermont senator's energized base.

""That's convincing to some Democrats,"" he said.

Watters also called out what he claimed was a potential double standard, saying Trump would be vilified in the media if House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., subpoenaed a single email -- and the president ""acid-washed"" it and claimed it was about golf.

He said Clinton has gone without much media scrutiny for her own email scandal."

GIULIANI ASSOCIATES NABBED FOR ALLEGED CAMPAIGN CRIMES

WSJ: “Two Soviet-born donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee who helped Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to investigate Democrat Joe Biden were arrested late Wednesday on criminal charges of violating campaign finance rules, including funneling Russian money into President Trump’s campaign. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Florida businessmen, have been under investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the people said. Both men were born in former Soviet republics. Mr. Giuliani, President Trump’s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump’s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action… A Justice Department official said [Attorney General William Barr] was supportive of their work on the case, on which he was first briefed shortly after being confirmed as attorney general in February.”



Fox poll: Record support for Trump’s ouster - Fox News: “Just over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office, according to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday. A new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether. In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don’t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.Since July, support for impeachment increased among voters of all stripes: up 11 points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans and 3 among independents. Support also went up among some of Trump’s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (+5 points), white men without a college degree (+8), and rural whites (+10). Among voters in swing counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016), support for impeachment increased to 52 percent, up from 42 percent in July.”



Pence to release transcripts of his Ukraine calls - AP: “Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he is working with the White House counsel’s office to release transcripts of his own calls with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pence said records of his two phone conversations would help exonerate President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing. Pence was asked about releasing his transcripts and told reporters, ‘I’d have no objection to that.’ He spoke after an event in Waukee, Iowa, where he addressed supporters about the president’s trade policy. Pence said he ‘never discussed the issue of the Bidens’ with Zelenskiy. And he again defended the president, insisting that a ‘plain reading’ of the rough transcript of Trump’s call with the Ukranian leader shows ‘there was no quid pro quo.’”



Pergram: Trump team’s stonewalling speeds up Democrats’ timetable - Fox News: “Next Tuesday is the deadline for most of the House’s requests. That coincides with the day the House returns to session. [Nancy] Pelosi will take the temperature of her caucus when lawmakers return. But in some respects, Pelosi already knows the temperature. Democrats are seething over the administration failing to meet congressional demands. They think they have a robust case against the president when it comes to obstruction of Congress. Pelosi could grant the administration more time to comply. That would let the issue marinate in public for a bit – and demonstrate that Democrats aren’t hasty to impeach. But after that, the House Judiciary Committee could begin drafting articles of impeachment. Pelosi doesn’t travel roads like this unless she already knows the outcome. She doesn’t lose votes on the floor – especially something of this magnitude.”



Trump’s Syria decision affects GOP backing on impeachment - WaPo: “President Trump’s decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has angered evangelical Christian leaders and Republican hawks, cleaving his political coalition at the very moment he is trying to fortify his standing to survive the intensifying impeachment inquiry in Congress. Instead of enjoying uncontested GOP support as he plunges into a constitutional showdown with House Democrats and prepares for a bruising reelection campaign, Trump is now fighting on two fronts within his party. … The past few days have tested the bounds of Trump’s Republican support at an unusually frenzied political crossroads that has brought uncertainty for elected officials. While GOP lawmakers have been skittish about directly engaging the subject at the heart of the impeachment debate — the president’s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart — many have felt free to loudly condemn Trump’s Syria decision, underscoring the fluidity within GOP ranks.”



The Judge’s Ruling: With Syria, Trump lives up to his campaign promise - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains that President Trump removing U.S. troops from Syria complies with his duty to uphold the Constitution: “Trump ran for office promising to bring the troops home. He may have made the latest decision to do so without adequate warning to his military commanders, but his decision is utterly consistent with his promises, and it is utterly in compliance with the Constitution. Now is the time for Congress -- which is largely angry at the presidential use or nonuse of the military -- to repeal both AUMFs and the War Powers Resolution and reclaim its constitutional power as the sole entity in the federal government able to declare war. Until it does, these profoundly outdated, morally ambivalent and overtly unconstitutional statutes lie in the presidential desk drawer like a loaded gun.” More here.



THE RULEBOOK: CUE ‘I’M JUST A BILL’

“The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 69



TIME OUT: ‘WHY YOU SHOULD BE EATING MORE CHEDDAR’

WSJ: “For over 150 years cheddar was the most popular cheese in the U.S. It sustained colonists and Civil War soldiers, and was the foundation for the industrial innovation of processed ‘American’ cheese. Only recently was cheddar demoted to second place in overall consumption, usurped by that ubiquitous pizza-topper, mozzarella. Though English in origin, cheddar has been part of the American experience from the very start, and today some of this country’s best cheese makers are turning out better cheddar than ever before. Cheddaring, the stacking of blocks of drained curds to extract more whey, creates a sturdy curd suited to aging. … Commodity cheddar is a publicly traded product whose destiny is frozen food, pre-shredded packs and economy supermarket wedges; specialty cheddar, made on a small scale and sold primarily at cheese counters and gourmet stores, is often preserved in wax or clothbound (wrapped in cotton cloth and rubbed with oil or lard).”

BIDEN TRIES COUNTERPUNCHING

Politico: “After calling for Donald Trump’s impeachment for the first time, Joe Biden experienced something here he rarely sees on the campaign trail: a sustained standing ovation. …[T]he former vice president’s roll-out of a swaggering, fire-breathing approach and full embrace of impeachment signaled a dramatic departure from course — a change in direction necessitated by weeks of Trump’s siege warfare. … It was his most aggressive posture to date, presenting a case that Trump could not be trusted, while positioning himself as the fighter that America needs at this moment to face off against a ‘bully’ and a ‘coward.’ … He also took a veiled shot at Elizabeth Warren, who has overtaken Biden in recent national polls and whose campaign mantra is centered on her dozens of policy plans. … Biden’s shift toward a harsher tone and his evolution on impeachment was born out of circumstance, necessity and personal animus. It came after days of privately huddling with advisers.”



Sanders retracts statement about slowing down campaign - NBC News: “Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday tamped down speculation that he would slow his presidential campaign after he suffered a heart attack last week, saying he plans to compete as vigorously as ever for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The Vermont independent told NBC in an exclusive interview airing Wednesday night on ‘Nightly News’ and Thursday on the ‘Today’ show that his health scare has only strengthened his resolve, despite telling reporters a day earlier he planned to curtail his normally packed schedule. ‘I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,’ Sanders said during the interview alongside his wife, Jane Sanders. … He added, ‘I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.’”



Warren refreshes vow against high-dollar fundraisers - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she will continue to swear off high-dollar campaign fundraisers in the general election if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, extending her self-imposed ban on the events beyond the primary and reversing an earlier statement. ‘When Elizabeth is the Democratic nominee for president, she’s not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,’ campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement Tuesday, which Warren later amplified in a Twitter thread. … That broad statement worried some Democrats, as the party’s presidential nominee traditionally has been a big fundraiser for other candidates and Democratic committees. But in a Wednesday statement, Orthman clarified that Warren's pledge would apply only to her presidential campaign, not to raising money for the Democratic Party or other candidates.”



TEAM TRUMP GOING ALL OUT FOR MINNESOTA, YOU BETCHA

NYT: “A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M. Nixon’s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent… This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory… Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign’s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100.”



LOUISIANA GOVERNOR RACE HEATS UP IN CLOSING DAYS

Politico: “The last televised primary debate in Louisiana saw Republicans Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone go after [Democratic Gov. John Bel] Edwards — but also each other, as they seek a second-place finish in an uncertain runoff. Rispone took the opportunity to post a question to Abraham, asking why he promised to donate his congressional salary but later stopped doing so, while Abraham criticized Rispone for his past support of Common Core. The two also argued back and forth about each other’s records, with Abraham accusing Rispone of running ‘distasteful’ attack ads, and Rispone calling Abraham’s line of attack on Common Core ‘an outright lie.’ The pair of Republicans did train their fire on Edwards, too. They hit him over the state’s economy and needled him on why he backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 — an attempt to nationalize the race, with President Donald Trump, who’s been tweeting proflicially about the race, planning an election-eve visit to Lake Charles on Friday night.”



McGrath raises $10.7 million in campaign to oust McConnell - WashTimes: “Democrat Amy McGrath raised a record $10.7 million in the last three months for her bit to topple Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate race in Kentucky. Ms. McGrath, a Marine fighter pilot, is the leading Democratic candidate in the race to take on Mr. McConnell, a six-term senator who is immensely unpopular in his home state. The $10.7 million that Ms. McGrath raised in the third quarter came from 299,000 donors with an average individual contribution of $36. ‘Mitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations — from all 120 Kentucky counties — have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,’ said McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris! Woah, woah, woah! Can we please get an emergency podcast to discuss the new Fox News poll that has 51% of Americans supporting impeachment and removal? This seems crazy, yet not entirely surprising!” – Katie Hacker, Evington, Va.



[Ed. note: I don’t know if we can manage that one, Ms. Hacker, but how about a little Bleacher banter? It may be best here to look at our excellent pollsters’ work in context. If you check out FiveThirtyEight’s very helpful averages on the subject, you’ll see that support for impeachment has been on a sharp increase. On the day when the news broke that the President Trump had sought help from the Ukrainian president in getting dirt on the Bidens, opposition to impeachment ran 11 points ahead, 51 percent to 40 percent. That was in mid-September. Today, the average stands at 49 percent in favor of impeachment and 43 percent opposed. Support among Democrats and independents has jumped 10 points or more while Republicans increased a more modest, but still significant, 4 points on average. The takeaway from our poll and every other credible pollster is that the tide has turned decisively against the president. There is still a long way to go here and public opinion on this subject is obviously malleable. But if more than 80 percent of Democrats are already on board, it’s hard to see that number declining much any time soon. That means Team Trump’s urgent work is to convince increasingly skeptical independent voters that the president deserves to remain in office. It won’t be enough to count on the anger of core Republican supporters.]



“I've been following your continued response to readers who stubbornly insist on asking for a crime worthy of impeachment. Your response is that it's not a legal issue but a political issue. As a devotee of the U.S. Constitution, I really think that your reading of the ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ standard should actually read ‘high crimes, misdemeanors, and anything else the U.S. House of Representatives feels adequate to the occasion’ would be more of a support for your position. But, alas, such language seems to be missing. Or am I reading the wrong U.S. Constitution? Please advise.” – Bill Panagakos, Littleton, Colo.



[Ed. note: It may be helpful here to look at the intent of the Framers in devising the vehicle. Here’s what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 about the purpose of impeachment: “Those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” was a term of art long before the Constitution was drafted. As Hamilton alludes to in the passage above, the “high” in the term refers to the office more so than the offenses. The purpose of impeachment isn’t to prosecute federal officials for crimes, but rather to remove them from office for abusing their powers and breaching the public trust. The Framers were following in the footsteps of British politician and political philosopher, Edmund Burke. In his famous speech in 1786 seeking the impeachment of the governor general of India, Warren Hastings, for self-seeking, tyrannical treatment of the crown’s Indian subjects Burke declared “the principles of honor, the spirit of cavaliers to govern here; not the low principles of jurisprudence only.” Hastings’ scandal and trial were very much on the minds of Americans during the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and Burke’s view – that “principles of honor” were essential to consider – was the mainstream opinion on this side of the Atlantic. This is why the Senate, not the Supreme Court or some bicameral commission, was chosen to sit in judgment. Here’s Hamilton again: “The prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.” Sound familiar? The Senate, then indirectly elected by state legislatures, with its members serving six year terms, was seen as the best home for dispassionate, fair-minded evaluations of the facts at hand without the unpleasant thought of unelected judges removing an elected president. The House, more easily incited to partisan passion and more responsive to the immediate will of the electorate, can prosecute, but the upper chamber runs the show. Whether or not you agree with their assessment, if a majority of the members of the House believe that the president has abused his office for personal gain and should be removed, they would be entirely within the American understanding of an impeachable offense. Just as it would be within that tradition for the Senate to reject their claim if its members so choose. This is how the system is supposed to work. I imagine that Democrats will end up correlating their articles with existing criminal offenses, like the solicitation of campaign help from foreign countries and obstruction, but that’s just window dressing. Appeals to honor and ethics are enough.]



“Re: your report on Trey Gowdy joining Team Trump. Is he betting all his chips on a series of events that would get him a Supreme Court nomination?” – John Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: I wouldn’t get too far ahead of myself on this one. Gowdy’s friend and longtime fellow South Carolina Congressman Mick Mulvaney is the White House chief of staff. Gowdy is arguably the best suited man in America to go up against House Democrats in this matter. He has a strong reputation among Republicans but still enjoys some credibility among his former Democratic colleagues for his successful navigation of efforts by Trump loyalists to torch the FBI. And if anything, running point on a matter this explosively controversial and rankly partisan would diminish, rather than improve, his chances of being picked for the Supreme Court.]



“Chris and Brianna, Please tell me you took editorial liberty in quoting Federalist No. 30 and that Alexander Hamilton did not write in all caps. My image of the esteemed first Secretary of the Treasury will be forever marred if he was a precedent Twitter troll.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.



[Ed. note: Capitalization is a funny thing. We’ve only really had standard practices for the past century or so. Certainly back in 1787, it was highly irregular across the English-speaking world. If you look at our founding documents you’ll see that in those days, for example, it was conventional to capitalize nouns in the way modern German speakers do. Consider the American creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” As you can see, the capitalization of nouns isn’t even standard. Why “Rights” but not “men?” “Liberty” but not “truths?” What comes through is that capitalization was a form of emphasis, not grammatical rules. The capitalized words after the start of the sentence – “Creator,” “Rights,” “Life,” “Liberty” and “Happiness” – actually make for a kind of semaphore for the actual meaning of the sentence. The essence is there in those five key words. So yes, I’m sorry to break it to you that ALL CAPS was a thing before Twitter. And you can just imagine Hamilton, eyes and pen aflame responding to the opponents of the Constitution: “IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” There’s no record of whether Patrick Henry wrote back “u mad bro?”]

WHAT I LEARNED IN CHICK-FIL-A TRAINING IS…

WBNS: “A Chick-fil-A employee went above and beyond to help a customer having a bad day. Shauna Hall was getting out of her van when she dropped her phone in the parking lot of a Chick-fil-A in Stafford, Virginia. The phone fell into a storm drain. … That’s when Seth, a digital marketing director with Chick-fil-A, said he would help. After cleaning his finger after slicing it trying to remove the manhole cover to the drain, Seth went into the storm drain and retrieved Hall’s phone. It didn’t break in the fall and wasn’t wet. ‘As he was about to climb out of the hole he asked me to snap a picture so he could show his girlfriend what he did at work today,’ Hall said. Seth’s shift had just ended, yet he didn’t hesitate to stay and help a customer in need.”

“Behind the [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial], guarding him, is an arc of short quotations chiseled in granite. This is in keeping with that glorious feature of Washington’s monumental core — the homage to words (rather than images of conquest and glory, as in so many other capitals), as befits a nation founded on an idea.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) Aug. 26, 2011.

TIME FOR A RE-PETE?

What’s so great about fourth place?



If you’re South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, quite a lot actually.



Readers have no doubt been watching Elizabeth Warren’s steady gains against front-runner Joe Biden in recent weeks. She is now just 2.4 points behind Biden in our Democratic 2020 Power Ranking. As Biden continues to struggle with the enhanced scrutiny on his family’s buck raking facilitated by Biden’s proximity to power, we expect his troubles to continue.



While Democrats are loath to publically agree with President Trump, the facts of the case of Trump’s likely impeachment reinforce Biden’s strongest negatives: That he has been around too long and is too much of a swamp creature.



We know Biden supporters are preparing to spend millions to prop up the former Delaware senator in his third presidential quest, but it is hard to imagine that Biden could persist for long in second place.



When electability is your cri de coeur it’s hard to keep voters around when you don’t look so electable.



This is good news for Warren, no doubt. But she had better be worried that it is good news come too soon. As Biden is currently experiencing, being the frontrunner is not all aviator sunglasses and waffle cones.



Warren has long enjoyed kid-glove treatment from the press, with relatively little scrutiny on her very ambitious policy proposals. She has also gotten a couple of mulligans on biographical boo-boos. That won’t last if she gets out in front. The steady diet of opposition research that will fill reporters’ inboxes will see to that.



So cast your eyes down the list. You can skip over poor Bernie Sanders who is struggling not just with his own health issues, but with the tragic loss of his daughter-in-law. The Vermont senator has said he will scale back his campaigning, and is already 10 points behind Warren and falling.



Buttigieg, though, has been climbing. Perhaps the beneficiary of the unraveling of California Sen. Kamala Harris’ misbegotten campaign or perhaps some Biden skeptics defecting, Buttigieg is a man on the move.



Certainly Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are hoping that they would see their boats lifted by the melting of Biden’s iceberg, but Buttigieg may have the best case to make.



His fundraising haul in the third quarter says that he will have the resources to go the distance and his moderate-sounding appeal to voters would position him nicely to pick up the business-friendly Democratic donors who are terrified of either a Warren defeat or victory.



Whether Buttigieg can capitalize on the opportunity will depend on his ability to go toe-to-toe with Warren. In the first Buttigieg craze, he wasn’t able to translate interest into hard support. In a second go-around he’d have to play for keeps.



SANDERS TO SCALE BACK CAMPAIGN AFTER HEART SURGERY

WaPo: “[Bernie Sanders] visited a cardiologist Tuesday morning, and when he returned, he told reporters, ‘We’re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit.’ ‘Probably not doing four rallies a day,’ said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents. Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at ‘the appropriate time.’ Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records.”



Daughter-in-law, 46, killed by rare cancer - USA Today: “The daughter-in-law of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has died, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. Rainè Riggs was 46. The Lee & Martin Funeral Home in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, says Riggs died Saturday, the day Sanders returned to Vermont after suffering a heart attack. Her obituary said she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. Riggs, a neuropsychologist, was married to Levi Sanders, who ran unsuccessfully for a New Hampshire congressional seat in 2018. Riggs' obituary says she met Levi Sanders while the two worked at an emergency food shelter in Vermont. The obituary said Riggs was the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School for several years, and she started the Palliative Care Department for Dartmouth Medical Center. She also owned Riggs Geriatric Psychology in Windsor, Vermont. Riggs and Sanders had three children.”



Dianne Feinstein endorses Biden, snubs Harris - Fox News: “Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator. Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control. ‘I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,’ Feinstein said in a statement.”



THE RULEBOOK: SUFFICIENT RESOURCES

“I believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the history of mankind, that, IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 30



TIME OUT: ‘YESTERDAY’ CAME SUDDENLY

On this day in 1965, The Beatles’ “Yesterday” began its month-long reign as the top single in the U.S. The song, Paul McCartney’s masterwork, started as a dream. The Telegraph [U.K.]: “As McCartney explained in 1980: ‘I woke up with a lovely tune in my head. I thought, 'That’s great, I wonder what that is?' There was an upright piano next to me, to the right of the bed by the window. I got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th – and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot but because I’d dreamed it I couldn’t believe I’d written it. I thought, ‘No, I’ve never written like this before.’ But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing.’ McCartney was living in Wimpole Street, London, at the time, at the family home of Jane Asher, who he was dating at the time.”

TRUMP’S IMPEACHMENT PLAN: BURN DOWN THE HOUSE

Axios: “President Trump, while nervous about the historic stain of impeachment, is throwing everything he has into this fight: refusing all cooperation, running ads to profit politically, and torching every person who stands in opposition to him. When it all boils down, Trump really only trusts his own instincts. And his instincts here are the same as they were with the Mueller investigation: Fight like hell. No nuance or apology — not a hint of it. Turn the leader of the investigation (in this case, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff) into a conservative media villain. Condemn Trump enemies in the most incendiary and exaggerated language possible (treason, traitors, coup, etc.). Compared to the Mueller investigation, the Ukraine phone call appears to have more resonance with the general public. Republicans close to leadership and the White House tell Axios they're concerned by trend lines in a Washington Post poll showing 49% of Americans think Trump should be removed from office.”



Partisan lines holding - NBC News: “A majority of Americans say the allegations that President Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden are serious and need to be fully investigated, and they also believe the president hasn’t been honest and truthful about his actions. Still, the public is divided – largely along partisan lines – on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 43 percent supporting his removal given what they know today, versus 49 percent who oppose it. … According to the poll, 47 percent of Americans believe the allegations that Trump requested Ukraine’s president to look into the Bidens are either ‘quite serious’ or ‘extremely serious.’ That includes 73 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and even 21 percent of Republicans. By contrast, a combined 28 percent dismiss the allegations as either being not serious or false and without merit. Twenty-five percent of respondents say they don’t have an opinion or are unsure.”



Q Poll: Support for impeachment inquiry steady - Quinnipiac University: “After another week with impeachment in the news, registered voters nationwide are still divided on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, with 45 percent saying he should be impeached and removed and 49 percent opposing the idea, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. This compares to last week's poll, in which voters were evenly split on impeaching and removing the president 47 - 47 percent. In a poll released on September 25, before any major news about impeachment, voters were clearly against impeachment 37 - 57 percent. While nearly half of voters do not currently back impeachment, a majority of voters do still approve 53 - 43 percent of the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the U.S. House of Representatives in order to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against the president. A week ago, voters approved of the inquiry 52 - 45 percent.”



Gowdy joins Team Trump - Bloomberg: “Donald Trump has enlisted former Representative Trey Gowdy to work with the White House team combating the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry into the president, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Gowdy, a former prosecutor from South Carolina, is not formally joining the White House staff, according to the people. He was at the White House on Tuesday, according to one person who saw him there, before an eight-page letter was issued to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declaring that Trump and the administration wouldn’t participate in the impeachment inquiry.”



What will become of Mick Mulvaney? - The Atlantic: “[Mick] Mulvaney’s uncertain status says something about Trump’s mind-set. In the face of this latest peril, and nearly 1,000 days into his tenure, he still hasn’t settled on how the West Wing should run. Confronting the impeachment threat is a West Wing staff that Trump has largely neutered. Aides have been left guessing about who’s coming and going, much less what they’re supposed to say about accusations that Trump pressured Ukraine to ferret out dirt on his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden. In the two weeks since the whistle-blower complaint was released to the public, the White House still hasn’t articulated a clear legal, political, or communications strategy needed to withstand impeachment and keep Trump’s Republican support from eroding.”



Watergate lessons for GOP - FiveThirtyEight: “One complicating factor here is that if Republicans were to abandon Trump, history does not suggest that Trump loyalists would easily forgive them for joining the Democrats’ impeachment effort. Even though most Americans did eventually support removing [Richard] Nixon from office, Republican voters were mostly not part of that consensus. Days before he resigned, a Gallup poll found that only 31 percent of Republicans thought Nixon should no longer be president. And some of those supporters deeply resented their representatives for their role in ousting Nixon, which may even have contributed to the Democratic landslide in the 1974 midterm elections.”



SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN ARM RAISES RECORD CASH

WashEx: “The committee tasked with electing Republican senators amid the impeachment battle will report raising $47.7 million so far this year, an amount that is already greater than ever raised before in the year prior to an election year. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is crucial to protecting vulnerable incumbents like Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Martha McSally of Arizona. In the three-month period ending Sept. 30, the NRSC raised roughly $13.1 million, including approximately $5 million in September — and made the last payment on a $17 million debt left over from the midterm elections. The NRSC shared these figures with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, ahead of its upcoming Federal Election Commission filing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying maintain Republican control of the Senate. Currently there are 53 GOP senators in the conference.”



Planned Parenthood preps massive 2020 spending - Fox News: “Planned Parenthood, the behemoth nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care and is the nation’s largest abortion provider, says it’s making a major investment in the 2020 elections. Planned Parenthood’s political wings – which fight for legal protections for abortion – announced Wednesday that they’ll spend $45 million backing candidates who support abortion rights in elections next year ranging from the state house level to the White House. … The group says its top priority in 2020 is to defeat and unseat President Trump. Other priorities include helping Democrats retake control of the GOP-controlled Senate and holding the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. The group will target roughly 5 million voters across the country, with the spotlight on nine key swing states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.”



Bevin looks to impeachment backlash to hold on in Kentucky - RCP: “[Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin] has pressed the pending impeachment of President Trump into his own Kentucky reelection effort. Standing outside the governor’s mansion on Friday, Bevin tied his fate to Trump’s by condemning impeachment as ‘an absolute travesty’ and calling on his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Andy Beshear, to answer a ‘fundamental question’: Will Beshear support or oppose forcing the president from office? The Democrat doesn’t want to answer, and the ensuing drama in a 2019 race could draw a rough sketch of the electoral implications of impeachment in 2020.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I appreciate Ellen DeGeneres’ statement about her friendship with former President George W. Bush. How have we reached this point where we can’t be friends with, or at least be civil to, those who hold a different viewpoint? … The father of Christian Rock, Larry Norman, once told a joke about witnessing to people and the ‘religious’ terminology that is often used. In the story, the Christian becomes frustrated at the end of a conversation he’s been having with a friend because the friend doesn’t understand the terms justification, sanctification, or being saved. In frustration he shouts, ‘I’m trying to tell you the Good News!’ His friend asks, ‘What’s that?’ The Christian responds, ‘You’re going to Hell!’ To which his friend replies, ‘Well, what’s the bad news?’ The point of recounting that is to state that if we hold firm convictions, that’s fine, but we need to convey them in a loving and respectful way. Our actions speak louder than our words. If we’re not mindful of that, we risk offending the person, or worse, losing the opportunity for dialogue that we seek with the other person. I believe that in matters of faith especially, that would be a bad thing. As always, I wish you and your family God’s richest blessings!” – Paul Schnier, Shoreham, N.Y.



[Ed. note: Amen, Mr. Schnier! That goes for politics, too. Persuasion leads to consensus, which leads to durable reforms. Division leads to government by plurality, which leads to lurching. Blessings to you and yours, too.]



“I fully understand your point today about the legal (‘shoot someone on 5th Ave’) and political differences (‘posting TS documents on IG’) when viewing Congress' vested powers to impeach a sitting President. Hopefully this third time is a charm. What about this [Contributions and donations by foreign nationals.] I believe this is what your colleague Judge [Andrew Napolitano] has been referencing in his argument on recent articles and TV shows. … The difference between this and the Mueller/Russia case was that this bordered on bribery in ‘bribes, high crimes and misdemeanors.’ Mueller's case was weak and bordered on emotion. This is a stronger case with a self-admitted crime, No? An independent voter's perspective.” – Jai Suresh, Fremont, Calif.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Suresh. But, no matter which side you take here, the question of impeachment still isn’t about the law. The question is political, or at best, moral. It is what the members of the House (and the constituents they represent) say it is. Efforts to find specific criminal charges miss the point of the endeavor.]

EAU DE BIG BOY

AP: “An Ohio homeowner never envisioned becoming semi-famous because of a goat butting its way into her home and taking a nap in her bathroom. … The break-in happened Friday when an escaped male goat from a farm several miles away repeatedly butted against a sliding glass door... [Jennifer Keathley’s] 18-year-old son, Logan, discovered the billy goat in the bathroom when he returned home Friday afternoon from school to find the family’s agitated German Shepherd in the driveway, broken glass on the back porch and the house reeking. … Two Ashland County Sheriff’s deputies unsuccessfully tried to coax the goat, named Big Boy, out of the home with carrots, a dog bone and grass. They eventually grabbed him by the horns and dragged him outside… The Keathleys learned their home insurance policy covers damage from bears and deer but not goats. … Despite applications of carpet deodorant and urine neutralizer, she said the odor from Big Boy’s urine still lingers.”

“Or more prosaically, the catastrophe that awaits everyone from a single false move, wrong turn, fatal encounter. Every life has such a moment. What distinguishes us is whether — and how — we ever come back.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Aug. 17, 2007.

A standout moment of the June 27 Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GET HEALTH CARE, SAY DEMS IN NIGHT 2 DEBATE

Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it “the end of the race.”

But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year.

While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally.

The CIS study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare.

The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637.

If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.”

These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress.

“Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.”

Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats.

AOC PUSHES NATIONAL RENT CONTROL, WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN LATEST MASSIVE PROPOSAL

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.”

Among those bills is “The Embrace Act,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally.

""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads.

The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”"

Bernie Sanders' controversial statement that ""there should be no billionaires.""

BERNIE SANDERS: 'BILLIONAIRES SHOULD NOT EXIST'

""Well, Mark, that’s easy for you to say, since you are worth an estimated $70 billion dollars and since – despite the best efforts of people like Bernie Sanders – we are not yet a socialist nation and you know that money won’t be confiscated from you,"" Lahren said in her Fox Nation daily commentary, ""Final Thoughts.""

Zuckerberg was speaking during a recent livestreamed question-and-answer session with Facebook employees when he made the surprising assertion.

Asked to respond to Sanders' declaration that billionaires should not exist, Zuckerberg – the fifth richest person in the world – offered his unexpected take.

ZUCKERBERG SIDES WITH BERNIE SANDERS ON BILLIONAIRES

“I understand where he’s coming from,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level, no one deserves to have that much money.”

Lahren went after the billionaire, slamming him for his ""hypocritical"" support of Sanders and his call to prevent Americans from attaining ""billionaire"" status.

""Looks like slamming capitalism, while benefiting from capitalism, is quite lucrative ... I’m sure it is easy for you to sit in one of your 10 properties and ponder whether you deserve it...while basking in it all,"" she said.

FACEBOOK CEO THREATENS LAWSUIT AGAINST ELIZABETH WARREN

Later in the segment, Lahren applauded Zuckerberg's plan to donate 99 percent of his Facebook shares to charity, specifically the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative – which uses technology to solve challenges like eradicating disease and reforming the criminal justice system – but noted that his decision to do so represented the very premise on which capitalism was founded on.

""That’s fantastic,"" said Lahren, ""but in a way, this only makes my point. Zuckerberg was able to achieve and attain his billions by working hard – harder than most – taking chances, building a company and a mega-brand via innovation and capitalist principles,"" she said.

FACEBOOK CEO MEETS WITH TRUMP, KEY SENATORS

""Think Facebook could have been founded in Cuba or Venezuela? Think again,"" she continued, referring to countries ruled largely by socialism.

Later in the segment, Lahren doubled down on her praise of the current capitalist structure in the U.S. and warned against redistribution of wealth.

""Zuck chooses to donate huge sums of his money the way he sees fit — not by government dictate or mandate. Would he prefer to pledge that estimated $67 billion in Facebook stock to the U.S. government? Send it to the swamp so the bureaucrats could divvy it up the way they see fit? I don’t think so,"" the Fox Nation host said.

BARR ASKS FACEBOOK CEO TO STOP END-TO-END ENCRYPTION PROGRAMS

""Whether Zuck wants to admit it or not,"" she continued, ""he knows taxation, confiscation and over-regulation kill innovation. He also believes he knows how to spend his money better than the almighty government. He lives his life like a compassionate capitalist and still feels like he must bow down to wannabe socialists like Bernie Sanders. Ridiculous,"" said Lahren.

The Fox Nation host reiterated her point, expressing support for hard work and unlimited financial potential — and urged liberals to ""butt out.""

""I am sick of these liberals telling us what we deserve and don't deserve,"" she concluded. ""This is America, we deserve what we work hard to earn ... butt out.""

The cancellation comes one day after a similar event featuring the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets was canceled.

The teams remain scheduled to play a pair of preseason games in China, planned for Thursday morning and Saturday morning, Eastern U.S. time, amid speculation that Chinese officials or possibly the NBA might postpone those events as well. At least one U.S. lawmaker, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has called on the league to pull out.

NBA-CHINA CONTROVERSY EXPOSED HOW DEPENDENT AMERICAN BASKETBALL IS ON BEIJING, FS1'S JASON WHITLOCK SAYS

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was heading to Shanghai on Wednesday in an effort to repair the league's relationship with China, according to the Associated Press. He said he did not expect the Lakers-Nets games to be canceled.

""But if those are the consequences of us adhering to our values, I still feel it's very, very important to adhere to those values,"" Silver said.

Photos posted on social media showed Lakers stars -- including LeBron James and Anthony Davis -- outside a facility where the team held a practice that was off-limits to the media, according to reports.

The NBA later postponed scheduled media sessions for both teams.

NBA Cares is the charity arm of the 30-team league that supports numerous causes, such as education and disaster relief.

But the two teams’ goodwill visit to the country has been overshadowed by a controversy sparked by a now-deleted Twitter message posted by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who expressed support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong who have been opposing what they view as Chinese interference in the island territory’s autonomy.

The tweet was especially offensive in China because the Rockets were the team of Yao Ming, a Shanghai native who played in the NBA from 2002 to 2011 and is considered the sport’s greatest ambassador in his home country. Several Chinese companies immediately cut ties with the Rockets.

Team star James Harden, who was with the Rockets in Japan, in a separate trip from the Lakers-Nets visit in China, apologized Monday on behalf of the organization.

""We apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,"" Harden said, according to ESPN. ""For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.""

Hong Kong has been a special administrative region of China since 1997, when Britain relinquished control.

Morey’s tweet also placed the NBA in the position of having to choose between supporting the free-speech values of the United States and pursuing business in China, a communist nation that ranks as the world’s No. 2 economy.

Not long after the tweet appeared, Silver said at a news conference that the league was “apologetic” over the fallout, but was “not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of speech."" Silver added that he “regrets” how so many Chinese people and NBA fans were upset by Morey's message.

""Daryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,"" Silver said, according to the Associated Press. ""What I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.""

Nevertheless, the league faced bipartisan criticism for its initial response.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., blasted the league as “hypocrites,” saying its players “have no problem speaking out on politics & social issues in America. But they apologize to #China for a pro democracy tweet from an NBA team executive.”

“We’re better than this,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote. “Human rights shouldn’t be for sale & the NBA shouldn’t be assisting Chinese communist censorship.

On Monday, presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote:

“China is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles – and our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights.""

Other critics noted that normally outspoken figures in the NBA – such as Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, and star Lakers player LeBron James, have been largely silent on the controversy.

The NBA regular season is scheduled to begin Oct. 22

* A day after saying he intended to scale back his campaign schedule in the wake of his heart attack, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told NBC News yesterday he “misspoke” and intends to “get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.”

* On a related note, the Vermont senator said he knew about the heart attack for a few days before it was disclosed to the public, but Sanders added that he’s nevertheless comfortable with the way his campaign handled the matter. “No apologies,” he said.

* Joe Biden yesterday made an unequivocal statement in support for Donald Trump’s impeachment, a step he’d previously been reluctant to take.

* On a related note, the former vice president’s campaign sent a written complaint to New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet yesterday, questioning the newspaper’s decision to publish an op-ed from Peter Schweizer and pointing to what Team Biden sees as a larger pattern of “journalistic malpractice.”

* And speaking of Biden’s campaign, it also reached out to Facebook about taking down a Trump campaign attack ad that includes demonstrably false claims. The social-media giant refused.

* Despite having qualified for next week’s Democratic presidential primary debate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is now saying she may boycott the event in order to protest a process she believes is “rigged” against her and candidates like her.

* Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said this week that she would continue to forgo big-dollar fundraising events, even if she wins her party’s presidential nomination next year. The senator later clarified, however, that she’d headline high-dollar events for the Democratic Party, but not to benefit her own campaign directly.

* And Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) was planning to retire at the end of this Congress, but she announced late yesterday that she’ll run for re-election one last time next year."

* Speaking of presidential travel, Trump was in Minneapolis last night for an unusually long campaign rally, at which he attacked all kinds of foes, targeting Joe Biden with particular zeal.

* Former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was planning a comeback next year, but now that he appears to be “Congressman-1” in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman – Rudy Giuliani’s associates who were arrested this week – the Texan’s political future is again in doubt.

* On a related note, many of the Republicans who received contributions from Parnas and Fruman are scrambling to either give the money back or donate it to charity.

* While most national Democratic presidential primary polls show Joe Biden’s lead over Elizabeth Warren disappearing, Fox News’ latest national poll shows the former vice president leading the Massachusetts senator, 32% to 22%. Bernie Sanders is third in the poll with 17%. (Also of interest, Beto O’Rourke reached 3% in the Fox poll, which moves him a little closer to qualifying for the party’s November primary debate.)

* As for the general election, Fox’s poll found Biden and Warren leading Trump by 10 points each, while Sanders leads the president in a hypothetical match-up by nine points.

* Forty-five years ago, Rep. Larry Hogan Sr. (R-Md.) was the first Republican on the House Judiciary Committee to vote to impeach Richard Nixon. Yesterday, his son, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan Jr. (R), announced his support for Congress’ impeachment inquiry into Trump.

* And in a bit of a surprise, House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) announced yesterday that she’ll retire at the end of this Congress. Her district, which Hillary Clinton carried by 20 points, is expected to remain in Democratic hands."

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have called for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren asked Belfort to weigh in on the current 2020 Democratic field, as many of the leading candidates have long criticized the financial industry.

""If one of these people gets into office, it will be a Warren or Sanders destruction.” — Jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amok, it gets really ugly,"" said Belfort. ""What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… but the policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said.

However, Belfort said that he believed that Trump will emerge with a victory in 2020.

“If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, OK? Because I think that this nation would be literally destroyed,"" he said. ""If one of these people gets into office—a Warren or Sanders—destruction.”

“He's a great salesman,"" Belfort continued, praising the president.

""I wish that he would say things in a way that p*** people off less because it doesn't help… but I can’t judge because he's president. I didn't become president, he did. I went to jail.”

Later in the episode, Belfort opened up about his notorious financial rise, devastating downfall, and how his time in prison helped reinvent his future.

“Of course, I'm remorseful about what happened,"" said Belfort, responding to Lahren, who questioned whether he regretted his past actions.

“I deserved to go to jail,"" Belfort continued. ""I definitely deserved to go to jail, it was a positive experience,” he recalled. “I thought the judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really [make sure]… I'll never forget—that was terrible. Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.”

Belfort was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which shed light on his early life and white-collar crimes that led to his eventual time in prison.

After serving 22 months between 2004 and 2006 for securities fraud totaling over $200 million, Belfort was also ordered to return $110 million to investors.

""The judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really [make sure]… I'll never forget that was terrible, Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.” — Jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street

Following his time in prison, Belfort worked on his sobriety and began to write his book -- which would serve as a basis for the film. Belfort described becoming sober and writing the book as pivotal experiences in his path to rehabilitation.

“When I wrote the book it was like… self-therapy to look back and examine all your actions… I love the movie—obviously, some things were fictionalized to serve the narrative so to speak… There are some things that bothered me that I thought made me look worse than I was and other things that probably didn't look as bad as I was,” Belfort recalled.

The 2013 film reportedly made an estimated $400 million worldwide and gained Belfort widespread recognition, kicking off his second career as a motivational speaker.

Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June.

The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.

Biden retains top billing with strong support among non-whites, voters over age 45, and moderates/conservatives. Warren has strengthened her position by increasing support among suburban voters, very liberals, and men.

When Democratic primary voters’ first and second choice preferences are considered together, Biden and Warren tie at 45 percent support, Sanders is at 34 percent, Harris 15 percent and Buttigieg 13 percent.

President Trump’s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden’s support in the primary race -- and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020: 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month. Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders.

At the same time, the poll finds the three top Democratic candidates with sizable leads over the president in potential head-to-head matchups.

The poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent). This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8.

“If Warren continues to poll as strongly against Trump as the former vice president, it makes it increasingly difficult for the Biden team to keep making the argument he is the most electable candidate,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw.

The impeachment inquiry hasn’t caused any real shifts in the ballot test, as Trump’s support in the two-way matchups has been between 37-42 percent all year. However, the poll finds an 8-point shift since last month in the number expecting Trump will be re-elected. In September, more thought he would win by a 6-point margin and now more expect he won’t by 2 points.

And while most Republican primary voters want to keep Trump as their party’s nominee, nearly one in five, 17 percent, would like to see someone else run.

“So far, Trump has been able to keep his Republican base on board,” says Shaw. “If the percentage opposing his re-nomination creeps into the 20s, that would be a troubling sign.”

Meanwhile, voters continue to believe Donald Trump is dishonest. Sixty-three percent say that -- far more than the 35 percent who think he is honest and trustworthy. By the way, that’s the same number who said Trump was honest before he won the 2016 election.

Vice President Mike Pence does a bit better than his boss, although not by much: 39 percent say he’s honest and 54 percent say dishonest.

On the other side, each of the top three Democratic candidates receives positive ratings on this measure. Sanders performs best with 59 percent saying he is honest and trustworthy (36 percent disagree). Fifty percent think Warren is honest vs. 44 percent dishonest, and for Biden voters split 48-47 percent.

Among Democrats, 87 percent think Sanders is honest and trustworthy, while 81 percent feel that way about Warren and 75 percent Biden. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump is honest.

Currently, 51 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Sanders, while 43 percent view him negatively. That puts him in positive territory by 8 points. More view Warren positively by 7 points (46 favorable vs. 39 unfavorable) and Biden by 6 (50 favorable vs. 44 unfavorable).

The ratings are closer to even for Buttigieg (+3 points), Yang (+3), Booker (-2), Harris (-3) and O’Rourke (-4). They each also have large numbers who have never heard of them or have no opinion of them. For example, 43 percent of voters are unable to rate Yang, while 36 percent can’t rate Buttigieg and 32 percent can’t rate Booker.

Voters view Trump more negatively than positively by 13 points (43-56). His personal favorable rating was underwater by 22 points in the days leading up to the 2016 election (38-60).

Twice as many primary voters say Trump’s allegations make them more likely to vote for Biden (21 percent more vs. 10 percent less), while twice as many say health concerns make them less (31 percent) rather than more likely (15 percent) to vote for Sanders in the primary.

Sanders is off the campaign trail since suffering a heart attack October 3. He’s 78 years old, while Biden is 76, Trump is 73, and Warren is 70.

Conducted October 6-8, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,003 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters and 4.5 points for Democratic primary voters (484)."

Fox News: “Together Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren capture the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election. Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.”



Biden’s firewall still strong - WaPo: “[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary. Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston … gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is ‘too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.’ And she doesn’t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.”



Will any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? - NYT: “It’s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden’s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son’s work and his service as vice president. … So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. … In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden’s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive… Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged — in false ways — by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats’ ire.”



Jane Sanders takes starring role in husband’s campaign - NYT: “When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. … When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders … stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, ‘especially me,’ had told him to slow down. … In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be ‘egotistical’ to call herself Mr. Sanders’s top adviser but allowed that she was ‘very much a close adviser.’ Above all, she said, she was ‘his wife.’”



Voter intensity on both sides through the roof - Gallup: “A year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given ‘quite a lot of thought’ to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.”



THE RULEBOOK: CLOAK AND DAGGER

“It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite. These are cases where the most useful intelligence may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be relieved from apprehensions of discovery.” – John Jay, Federalist No. 64



TIME OUT: ‘A STATUE OF FLORENTINE BRONZE’

Paris Review: “In the late summer of 1866, a black equestrian stuntwoman made her Paris debut and galvanized the city. She was known only as ‘Sarah the African,’ and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, ‘the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,’ ‘an Ethiopian,’ or ‘a statue of Florentine bronze.’ A ‘negress’ who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by Georges Cuvier just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer’s hit posthumous opera, L’Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. … On her debut in September she was billed above Méphistophélès the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman, William Meyer, and even above Mlle Adèle, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.”

GIULIANI’S WOES MOUNT

ABC News: “The business relationship between President Donald Trump's private lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the men charged Thursday in a campaign finance scheme is a subject of the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by federal authorities in New York, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The investigation became public after the FBI had to quickly move to arrest Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman before they boarded a flight out of the country from Washington Dulles Airport with one-way tickets. They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.”



Former Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign - AP: “Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was ‘abruptly’ recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a ‘concerted campaign against me’ and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. ‘Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,’ Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.”



Report: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client - WaPo: “President Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic ‘deal’ to stop the U.S. case against Reza Zarrab on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson — including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.”



Pete Session’s political revival threatened by Ukraine role - NYT: “Former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as ‘Congressman-1’ in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani… Mr. Sessions’s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.”



Continetti: We are all Ukrainians - Free Beacon: “From Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.”



TRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY

Yahoo: “The president’s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president, Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard. ‘Trey Gowdy doesn’t know s***,’ she said. … ‘He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, ‘Well, if you’ve done nothing wrong, just talk to Bob Mueller.’’ Toensing and her husband, Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump’s legal team.”



And he can’t even join until January - WashEx: “Former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, ‘Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there’s a problem with, he can’t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.’ It was only a day after Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. … Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession, federal law prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.”



DEMS DIVIDED ON TIMING OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “House Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not holding a vote authorizing the House’s impeachment proceedings — arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate. Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump’s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn’t changed, describing the idea as the latest ‘Republican canard’ in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. … Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately — and, to a lesser extent, publicly — that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats’ unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.”



House members get an earful from voters back home - Politico: “The ‘Make America Great Again’ hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep. Anthony Brindisi’s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. … Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can’t avoid it. … But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves — serving as the party’s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats’ chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.”



Independents’ support for impeachment jumps 10 points - NPR: “A slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split — 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.”



ROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP

Politico: “President Donald Trump wants to sideline Mitt Romney — but the Utah senator isn’t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 — headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner and Michigan Senate hopeful John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney’s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump’s efforts to ostracize him.”



Dems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat - NYT: “Ms. [Nita] Lowey’s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman, David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that ‘if someone were to step down or retire,’ she would ‘have to think if it’s the right choice for me.’ Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey’s district: Her parents’ house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district. Ms. Clinton herself does not live in Westchester, but congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent. A representative for Ms. Clinton did not return a request for comment. Mr. Buchwald said he would make an announcement within a few days.”



Ocasio-Cortez draws credible primary challenger - Fox News: “A prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives seat currently held by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a ‘no show’ in the district. ‘Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it’s going to be a moderate Democrat,’ Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. ‘She’s a no-show in the district. She hasn’t brought about anything except division within the party.’ ‘Socialism doesn’t work,’ Cabrera added.”



Pompeo ally steps aside in Kansas Senate race - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas business leader with longtime ties to Mike Pompeo will not run for U.S. Senate after weighing a bid for months — renewing speculation about whether the secretary of state will enter the race. Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, in the past has said he would defer to Pompeo if the chief diplomat decided to mount a campaign. Cobb, a former Koch Industries lobbyist, advised Pompeo in 2014 during a congressional primary battle against former Rep. Todd Tiahrt. He made no mention of Pompeo in a lengthy statement Thursday announcing his decision. Cobb said that ‘after months of serious deliberation, analysis, and careful and prayerful consideration with friends, colleagues and my family, I have decided that the best place for me to pursue my passion is to remain as the President and CEO of the Kansas Chamber.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I need your help. I don’t get what is going on with the Syria/Turkey situation. I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn’t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don’t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn’t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.” – E’Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa



[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small – measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey’s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president’s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks’ zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]



“I am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as ‘news.’ But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question. That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong? Please explain! And keep up the good work!!!” – Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand



[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An “impeachment inquiry” is not a thing. It’s like a couple being “pre-engaged.” But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an “impeachment inquiry” and “impeachment” is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]



“All my teams have long gone home for the winter. So now we have your traditional Nine in the form of the quite surprising Cardinals playing your hometown Nationals (who should be the Senators and in the American League with Walter Johnson throwing flames, but oh, well). Where do your loyalties lie?” – Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.



[Ed. note: Hometown!? Washington, D.C.!? My place of residence, certainly. And I do love living here. But c’mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team. I admire the Nats’ pluck and am grateful for the chance they are affording me to watch the National League Championship Series in person. But I love the Cardinals and am absolutely over the moon with this year’s squad. What a bunch! The infield alone may be the greatest since my glory days of fandom in the mid-1980s. Matt Carpenter is an absolute rock for the team and the personification of professionalism, Paul DeJong is a clutch player (whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?) who seems like he was born to be a Cardinal, Kolten Wong surfs second base like the pros ride waves at Honoli’i in his hometown and Paul Goldschmidt has shown in his tenacity, play and quality of his character that he is truly in the right uniform. And Yadi is nothing less than a national treasure. So suffice it to say: Viva el Birdos!]



“How ‘bout them Redbirds! We miss you on Twitter where we could delight in the pure joy emanating from Cardinals gifs, memes, and tweets after a playoff series win…but the mailbag will have to do!” – Jack Whiteman, St. Louis

‘THIS IS A NUDGE TO PICK UP THE FUDGE’

AP: “Officials in a southwest Missouri city are planting small flags in piles of abandoned dog poop as part of a campaign to get residents to clean up after their pets downtown. The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, ‘Is this your turd? ‘Cuz that's absurd’ and ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.’ The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides. One has an instinctive feeling that religion has a place in American public life, and that both sides misunderstand it—that between sectarianism and secularism lies something else.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the New Republic on April 9, 1984.

“It’s a known thing that the middle class is going to pick up the tab for Elizabeth Warren’s plans,” said Bovard, the Conservative Partnership Institute's senior director of policy, Thursday on “Fox & Friends.”

The leading Democratic presidential contender announced Wednesday a plan to spend at least $1 trillion – of her $3 trillion climate plan – to help communities hit hard by industrial pollution, particularly low-income areas and communities of color.

WARREN FACES MOUNTING QUESTIONS ON ANOTHER PART OF HER PERSONAL STORY: WAS SHE FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT?

VIDEO APPEARS TO CONTRADICT WARREN'S SUGGESTION THAT SCHOOL FIRED HER OVER PREGNANCY

Warren's announcement came in a campaign video posted to Twitter, which shows the Massachusetts senator visiting a neighborhood in southwest Detroit, often referred to as the most polluted area in Michigan, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who represents the district. In the clip, Warren speaks to community members about residents who have been diagnosed with cancer linked to exposure to toxins after years of living in the shadow of a massive oil refinery.

The plan, which has been posted to her website, builds upon policies covering everything from affordable housing to green manufacturing to clean energy. She stresses the need to build “strong, resilient communities” by doing more than just “cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.”

Bovard cited an estimate by the Manhattan Institute's Brian Riedl, who claimed that the aggregate cost of Warren’s plans would be $38-48 trillion and would require a middle-class tax since a wealth tax would not be able to pay for it all. The most expensive of Warren's proposals is a 'Medicare-for-all' health care system,which she has promised will cover all Americans.

“If you just do the math, even with a wealth tax, you’re only raising a fifth of what her aggregate policy proposals will cost,” Bovard said.

Bovard said Warren has refused to answer questions about how the plans will be funded, including in a recent interview with ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert.

Biden is on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Warren at 22 percent -- up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June.

The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.

""I'm a little surprised because there has been so much in the press about how Warren is charging,"" he said.

Sanders said Wednesday on ""The Story"" that as a Delaware senator, former Vice President Joe Biden urged congressional restraint in two past impeachment inquiries and had done so with Trump until recently.

""It's a fair question -- why today and why now?"" Sanders opened by saying, in reference to Biden telling a New Hampshire crowd earlier Wednesday he now backs impeaching Trump.

""I think the acts of the last 15 days are what moved Vice President Biden to this position. Fifteen days ago, Vice President Biden was in Wilmington, Delaware, and he gave a statement.

Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, while Clinton was impeached by the House but a Senate vote did not garner enough support to remove him from office.

Kamala Harris while moderating the network’s LGBTQ town hall in California earlier in the evening.

Cuomo, 49, began the Los Angeles event -- before an audience composed of members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities and their allies -- by welcoming Harris, D-Calif., to the stage.

Harris, following an LGBTQ custom, said her preferred pronouns were “she, her, and hers.""

“Mine too,” Cuomo quipped. But the comment drew negative reaction on social media.

""painfully awkward,"" one user wrote.

Cuomo later apologized on Twitter, writing: “PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize.

“I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall,” he wrote.

But even Cuomo's apology drew backlash.

""Fredo Cuomo grovels to the intolerant left like a good puppy,"" one commenter wrote.

Aside from Harris, eight other Democratic 2020 contenders took part in the CNN event.

Former Vice President Joe Biden began a sentence saying, “When I came out … ,” using a phrase commonly employed by those publicly identifying as LGBTQ for the first time.

“That would be news,” CNN's Anderson Cooper interjected, prompting Biden to walk across the stage to embrace him.



“I got something to tell you ... ,” Biden started to joke to Cooper, who is gay.

“I kind of figured it out a while ago,” Cooper replied.

Biden also responded to a question from Shannon Scott, a 10-year U.S. Air Force veteran, who claimed she had to choose between serving in the military and her identity as a transgender woman because of the Trump administration's policy on those diagnosed with gender dysphoria serving in the military.

Biden said he would change the Trump policy if elected president.

""If I were president, you would not have to choose,"" he said. ""Not a joke. You would not have to choose. The fact of the matter is that we're in a position where transgender men and women are in a position where they should be able to do anything anybody else in the world can do. There should be no difference.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., addressed a comment she made in 2012, in which she said she did not support the use of taxpayer money to fund transgender reassignment surgery for prison inmates.

""It was a bad answer,” Warren told the audience. “And I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care they need. And that includes people who are transgender who, it is the time for them to have gender affirming surgery. I just think that’s important.""

Harris said she would make stopping the spread of HIV/AIDs within a decade one of her top priorities if she becomes president.

That’s the same line the former vice president used a day earlier – to a rousing standing ovation – as Biden, for the first time, unequivocally called for the impeachment of Trump.

While the president has been front-and-center in the Ukraine controversy that sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, Biden’s another key player, and with the impeachment push overshadowing the 2020 White House race, the Democrat has grabbed outsized attention over his rivals for the presidential nomination.

BIDEN, WARREN, GAIN GROUND IN NEW FOX NEWS POLL

It’s a double-edged sword for the former vice president, with Trump’s allegations against Biden’s own Ukraine connection also in the spotlight.

Biden on Wednesday launched a forceful attack on the president – coming from a candidate who in recent weeks was anything but aggressive in calling for Trump’s impeachment, unlike most of his 2020 rivals.

“We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It’s no joke,” Biden emphasized during two speeches in New Hampshire. “He’s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.”

Biden’s announcement came one day after the White House vowed not to play ball with the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, but it also came as the former vice president lost his polling status as the unrivaled front-runner. Biden’s neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in most of the recent national and early-voting-state surveys, although he held a lead in the latest Fox News Poll.

FOR FIRST TIME, BIDEN CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT

And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

With those setbacks in mind, the unveiling of the more aggressive, in-your-face approach by Biden has been seen as considerably timely.

“It gets his sea legs under him,” noted Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden friend, adviser and fundraiser. “It gives everybody more energy.”

Rasky, who’s not directly involved in Biden’s 2020 campaign, predicted, “it’s definitely going to help fundraising.”

He added that donors “are happy to see Biden taking on the fight with intensity.”

Biden, in his speeches, taunted the president, claiming “he’s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November.”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran noted that such swagger would resonate with voters. She also said the Ukraine controversy put the spotlight on foreign relations, a wheelhouse for the former vice president.

“His remarks yesterday came across as an ‘enough is enough’ call to action and reminder to the American electorate of the fighter and statesman they have long known,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

The impeachment inquiry was sparked by Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was asking a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, Trump has insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no ""quid pro quo"" and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLAMS NY TIMES FOR OP-ED ON FORMER VP'S UKRAINE TIES

The president and allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on Biden and his son.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Biden also accused the president of throwing “lies and distortions and smears” at him and his son, “because he thinks he’ll undermine my candidacy for the nomination as well as the presidency if I am the nominee.”

While the Fox News national poll released Wednesday indicated that a majority said the president should be impeached and removed from office, Biden has faced warning signs of his own.

MAJORITY BACK TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IN LATEST FOX NEWS POLL

Thirty-six percent questioned in the survey said they found the Trump allegations against Biden extremely or very troubling. That included 34 percent of independents and even 24 percent of Democrats.

Longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed highlighted that “the discussion involving Ukraine is going to involve a continued focus on why Hunter Biden was being paid $50,000 a month to sit on the board of an energy company with him having absolutely no expertise in that area.”

Reed emphasized, “I think that crony capitalism does not sit well with voters in the center, right or left.”

And, Biden’s increased criticism aimed at the president likely will incite further attacks from Trump.

While the former vice president was speaking in New Hampshire, the president took to Twitter to return fire.

“So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!” Trump wrote."

""I outraised him, I out-debated him, I could beat him again if I just go to Wisconsin,"" Watters said, imitating what Clinton would say.

Watters also called out what he claimed was a potential double standard, saying Trump would be vilified in the media if House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., subpoenaed a single email -- and the president ""acid-washed"" it and claimed it was about golf.

He said Clinton has gone without much media scrutiny for her own email scandal."

GIULIANI ASSOCIATES NABBED FOR ALLEGED CAMPAIGN CRIMES

WSJ: “Two Soviet-born donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee who helped Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to investigate Democrat Joe Biden were arrested late Wednesday on criminal charges of violating campaign finance rules, including funneling Russian money into President Trump’s campaign. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Florida businessmen, have been under investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the people said. Both men were born in former Soviet republics. Mr. Giuliani, President Trump’s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump’s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action… A Justice Department official said [Attorney General William Barr] was supportive of their work on the case, on which he was first briefed shortly after being confirmed as attorney general in February.”



Fox poll: Record support for Trump’s ouster - Fox News: “Just over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office, according to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday. A new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether. In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don’t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.Since July, support for impeachment increased among voters of all stripes: up 11 points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans and 3 among independents. Support also went up among some of Trump’s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (+5 points), white men without a college degree (+8), and rural whites (+10). Among voters in swing counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016), support for impeachment increased to 52 percent, up from 42 percent in July.”



Pence to release transcripts of his Ukraine calls - AP: “Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he is working with the White House counsel’s office to release transcripts of his own calls with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pence said records of his two phone conversations would help exonerate President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing. Pence was asked about releasing his transcripts and told reporters, ‘I’d have no objection to that.’ He spoke after an event in Waukee, Iowa, where he addressed supporters about the president’s trade policy. Pence said he ‘never discussed the issue of the Bidens’ with Zelenskiy. And he again defended the president, insisting that a ‘plain reading’ of the rough transcript of Trump’s call with the Ukranian leader shows ‘there was no quid pro quo.’”



Pergram: Trump team’s stonewalling speeds up Democrats’ timetable - Fox News: “Next Tuesday is the deadline for most of the House’s requests. That coincides with the day the House returns to session. [Nancy] Pelosi will take the temperature of her caucus when lawmakers return. But in some respects, Pelosi already knows the temperature. Democrats are seething over the administration failing to meet congressional demands. They think they have a robust case against the president when it comes to obstruction of Congress. Pelosi could grant the administration more time to comply. That would let the issue marinate in public for a bit – and demonstrate that Democrats aren’t hasty to impeach. But after that, the House Judiciary Committee could begin drafting articles of impeachment. Pelosi doesn’t travel roads like this unless she already knows the outcome. She doesn’t lose votes on the floor – especially something of this magnitude.”



Trump’s Syria decision affects GOP backing on impeachment - WaPo: “President Trump’s decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has angered evangelical Christian leaders and Republican hawks, cleaving his political coalition at the very moment he is trying to fortify his standing to survive the intensifying impeachment inquiry in Congress. Instead of enjoying uncontested GOP support as he plunges into a constitutional showdown with House Democrats and prepares for a bruising reelection campaign, Trump is now fighting on two fronts within his party. … The past few days have tested the bounds of Trump’s Republican support at an unusually frenzied political crossroads that has brought uncertainty for elected officials. While GOP lawmakers have been skittish about directly engaging the subject at the heart of the impeachment debate — the president’s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart — many have felt free to loudly condemn Trump’s Syria decision, underscoring the fluidity within GOP ranks.”



The Judge’s Ruling: With Syria, Trump lives up to his campaign promise - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains that President Trump removing U.S. troops from Syria complies with his duty to uphold the Constitution: “Trump ran for office promising to bring the troops home. He may have made the latest decision to do so without adequate warning to his military commanders, but his decision is utterly consistent with his promises, and it is utterly in compliance with the Constitution. Now is the time for Congress -- which is largely angry at the presidential use or nonuse of the military -- to repeal both AUMFs and the War Powers Resolution and reclaim its constitutional power as the sole entity in the federal government able to declare war. Until it does, these profoundly outdated, morally ambivalent and overtly unconstitutional statutes lie in the presidential desk drawer like a loaded gun.” More here.



THE RULEBOOK: CUE ‘I’M JUST A BILL’

“The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 69



TIME OUT: ‘WHY YOU SHOULD BE EATING MORE CHEDDAR’

WSJ: “For over 150 years cheddar was the most popular cheese in the U.S. It sustained colonists and Civil War soldiers, and was the foundation for the industrial innovation of processed ‘American’ cheese. Only recently was cheddar demoted to second place in overall consumption, usurped by that ubiquitous pizza-topper, mozzarella. Though English in origin, cheddar has been part of the American experience from the very start, and today some of this country’s best cheese makers are turning out better cheddar than ever before. Cheddaring, the stacking of blocks of drained curds to extract more whey, creates a sturdy curd suited to aging. … Commodity cheddar is a publicly traded product whose destiny is frozen food, pre-shredded packs and economy supermarket wedges; specialty cheddar, made on a small scale and sold primarily at cheese counters and gourmet stores, is often preserved in wax or clothbound (wrapped in cotton cloth and rubbed with oil or lard).”

BIDEN TRIES COUNTERPUNCHING

Politico: “After calling for Donald Trump’s impeachment for the first time, Joe Biden experienced something here he rarely sees on the campaign trail: a sustained standing ovation. …[T]he former vice president’s roll-out of a swaggering, fire-breathing approach and full embrace of impeachment signaled a dramatic departure from course — a change in direction necessitated by weeks of Trump’s siege warfare. … It was his most aggressive posture to date, presenting a case that Trump could not be trusted, while positioning himself as the fighter that America needs at this moment to face off against a ‘bully’ and a ‘coward.’ … He also took a veiled shot at Elizabeth Warren, who has overtaken Biden in recent national polls and whose campaign mantra is centered on her dozens of policy plans. … Biden’s shift toward a harsher tone and his evolution on impeachment was born out of circumstance, necessity and personal animus. It came after days of privately huddling with advisers.”



Sanders retracts statement about slowing down campaign - NBC News: “Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday tamped down speculation that he would slow his presidential campaign after he suffered a heart attack last week, saying he plans to compete as vigorously as ever for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The Vermont independent told NBC in an exclusive interview airing Wednesday night on ‘Nightly News’ and Thursday on the ‘Today’ show that his health scare has only strengthened his resolve, despite telling reporters a day earlier he planned to curtail his normally packed schedule. ‘I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,’ Sanders said during the interview alongside his wife, Jane Sanders. … He added, ‘I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.’”



Warren refreshes vow against high-dollar fundraisers - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she will continue to swear off high-dollar campaign fundraisers in the general election if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, extending her self-imposed ban on the events beyond the primary and reversing an earlier statement. ‘When Elizabeth is the Democratic nominee for president, she’s not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,’ campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement Tuesday, which Warren later amplified in a Twitter thread. … That broad statement worried some Democrats, as the party’s presidential nominee traditionally has been a big fundraiser for other candidates and Democratic committees. But in a Wednesday statement, Orthman clarified that Warren's pledge would apply only to her presidential campaign, not to raising money for the Democratic Party or other candidates.”



TEAM TRUMP GOING ALL OUT FOR MINNESOTA, YOU BETCHA

NYT: “A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M. Nixon’s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent… This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory… Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign’s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100.”



LOUISIANA GOVERNOR RACE HEATS UP IN CLOSING DAYS

Politico: “The last televised primary debate in Louisiana saw Republicans Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone go after [Democratic Gov. John Bel] Edwards — but also each other, as they seek a second-place finish in an uncertain runoff. Rispone took the opportunity to post a question to Abraham, asking why he promised to donate his congressional salary but later stopped doing so, while Abraham criticized Rispone for his past support of Common Core. The two also argued back and forth about each other’s records, with Abraham accusing Rispone of running ‘distasteful’ attack ads, and Rispone calling Abraham’s line of attack on Common Core ‘an outright lie.’ The pair of Republicans did train their fire on Edwards, too. They hit him over the state’s economy and needled him on why he backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 — an attempt to nationalize the race, with President Donald Trump, who’s been tweeting proflicially about the race, planning an election-eve visit to Lake Charles on Friday night.”



McGrath raises $10.7 million in campaign to oust McConnell - WashTimes: “Democrat Amy McGrath raised a record $10.7 million in the last three months for her bit to topple Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate race in Kentucky. Ms. McGrath, a Marine fighter pilot, is the leading Democratic candidate in the race to take on Mr. McConnell, a six-term senator who is immensely unpopular in his home state. The $10.7 million that Ms. McGrath raised in the third quarter came from 299,000 donors with an average individual contribution of $36. ‘Mitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations — from all 120 Kentucky counties — have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,’ said McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris! Woah, woah, woah! Can we please get an emergency podcast to discuss the new Fox News poll that has 51% of Americans supporting impeachment and removal? This seems crazy, yet not entirely surprising!” – Katie Hacker, Evington, Va.



[Ed. note: I don’t know if we can manage that one, Ms. Hacker, but how about a little Bleacher banter? It may be best here to look at our excellent pollsters’ work in context. If you check out FiveThirtyEight’s very helpful averages on the subject, you’ll see that support for impeachment has been on a sharp increase. On the day when the news broke that the President Trump had sought help from the Ukrainian president in getting dirt on the Bidens, opposition to impeachment ran 11 points ahead, 51 percent to 40 percent. That was in mid-September. Today, the average stands at 49 percent in favor of impeachment and 43 percent opposed. Support among Democrats and independents has jumped 10 points or more while Republicans increased a more modest, but still significant, 4 points on average. The takeaway from our poll and every other credible pollster is that the tide has turned decisively against the president. There is still a long way to go here and public opinion on this subject is obviously malleable. But if more than 80 percent of Democrats are already on board, it’s hard to see that number declining much any time soon. That means Team Trump’s urgent work is to convince increasingly skeptical independent voters that the president deserves to remain in office. It won’t be enough to count on the anger of core Republican supporters.]



“I've been following your continued response to readers who stubbornly insist on asking for a crime worthy of impeachment. Your response is that it's not a legal issue but a political issue. As a devotee of the U.S. Constitution, I really think that your reading of the ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ standard should actually read ‘high crimes, misdemeanors, and anything else the U.S. House of Representatives feels adequate to the occasion’ would be more of a support for your position. But, alas, such language seems to be missing. Or am I reading the wrong U.S. Constitution? Please advise.” – Bill Panagakos, Littleton, Colo.



[Ed. note: It may be helpful here to look at the intent of the Framers in devising the vehicle. Here’s what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 about the purpose of impeachment: “Those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” was a term of art long before the Constitution was drafted. As Hamilton alludes to in the passage above, the “high” in the term refers to the office more so than the offenses. The purpose of impeachment isn’t to prosecute federal officials for crimes, but rather to remove them from office for abusing their powers and breaching the public trust. The Framers were following in the footsteps of British politician and political philosopher, Edmund Burke. In his famous speech in 1786 seeking the impeachment of the governor general of India, Warren Hastings, for self-seeking, tyrannical treatment of the crown’s Indian subjects Burke declared “the principles of honor, the spirit of cavaliers to govern here; not the low principles of jurisprudence only.” Hastings’ scandal and trial were very much on the minds of Americans during the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and Burke’s view – that “principles of honor” were essential to consider – was the mainstream opinion on this side of the Atlantic. This is why the Senate, not the Supreme Court or some bicameral commission, was chosen to sit in judgment. Here’s Hamilton again: “The prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.” Sound familiar? The Senate, then indirectly elected by state legislatures, with its members serving six year terms, was seen as the best home for dispassionate, fair-minded evaluations of the facts at hand without the unpleasant thought of unelected judges removing an elected president. The House, more easily incited to partisan passion and more responsive to the immediate will of the electorate, can prosecute, but the upper chamber runs the show. Whether or not you agree with their assessment, if a majority of the members of the House believe that the president has abused his office for personal gain and should be removed, they would be entirely within the American understanding of an impeachable offense. Just as it would be within that tradition for the Senate to reject their claim if its members so choose. This is how the system is supposed to work. I imagine that Democrats will end up correlating their articles with existing criminal offenses, like the solicitation of campaign help from foreign countries and obstruction, but that’s just window dressing. Appeals to honor and ethics are enough.]



“Re: your report on Trey Gowdy joining Team Trump. Is he betting all his chips on a series of events that would get him a Supreme Court nomination?” – John Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: I wouldn’t get too far ahead of myself on this one. Gowdy’s friend and longtime fellow South Carolina Congressman Mick Mulvaney is the White House chief of staff. Gowdy is arguably the best suited man in America to go up against House Democrats in this matter. He has a strong reputation among Republicans but still enjoys some credibility among his former Democratic colleagues for his successful navigation of efforts by Trump loyalists to torch the FBI. And if anything, running point on a matter this explosively controversial and rankly partisan would diminish, rather than improve, his chances of being picked for the Supreme Court.]



“Chris and Brianna, Please tell me you took editorial liberty in quoting Federalist No. 30 and that Alexander Hamilton did not write in all caps. My image of the esteemed first Secretary of the Treasury will be forever marred if he was a precedent Twitter troll.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.



[Ed. note: Capitalization is a funny thing. We’ve only really had standard practices for the past century or so. Certainly back in 1787, it was highly irregular across the English-speaking world. If you look at our founding documents you’ll see that in those days, for example, it was conventional to capitalize nouns in the way modern German speakers do. Consider the American creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” As you can see, the capitalization of nouns isn’t even standard. Why “Rights” but not “men?” “Liberty” but not “truths?” What comes through is that capitalization was a form of emphasis, not grammatical rules. The capitalized words after the start of the sentence – “Creator,” “Rights,” “Life,” “Liberty” and “Happiness” – actually make for a kind of semaphore for the actual meaning of the sentence. The essence is there in those five key words. So yes, I’m sorry to break it to you that ALL CAPS was a thing before Twitter. And you can just imagine Hamilton, eyes and pen aflame responding to the opponents of the Constitution: “IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” There’s no record of whether Patrick Henry wrote back “u mad bro?”]

WHAT I LEARNED IN CHICK-FIL-A TRAINING IS…

WBNS: “A Chick-fil-A employee went above and beyond to help a customer having a bad day. Shauna Hall was getting out of her van when she dropped her phone in the parking lot of a Chick-fil-A in Stafford, Virginia. The phone fell into a storm drain. … That’s when Seth, a digital marketing director with Chick-fil-A, said he would help. After cleaning his finger after slicing it trying to remove the manhole cover to the drain, Seth went into the storm drain and retrieved Hall’s phone. It didn’t break in the fall and wasn’t wet. ‘As he was about to climb out of the hole he asked me to snap a picture so he could show his girlfriend what he did at work today,’ Hall said. Seth’s shift had just ended, yet he didn’t hesitate to stay and help a customer in need.”

Mike Allen and Alayna Treene of Axios said this about the kickoff, “Biden has gone all-in on the general election, positioning himself as the eventual Democratic nominee rather than scrapping with the 19 other wannabes.”

From Day One Biden wanted to pick a fight directly with Trump. That’s a smart strategy for a presumptive frontrunner.

JOE BIDEN WILL BE DEMOCRATS' 'COLLATERAL DAMAGE' IN QUEST TO IMPEACH TRUMP, CHARLES LANE SAYS

“I know there are times when only a bare-knuckle fight will do,” Biden exclaimed in May the kickoff to cheers. At one point, the crowd even erupted in chants screaming, “We want Trump!” and Biden repeated “Beat Trump” three times to emphasize this message.

The Team Biden strategy became clear: elevate Biden above the fray of the Democratic Primary and cast him as the “most electable” fighter who can go toe-to-toe with Trump.

Since May, Biden’s surrogates have continuously touted the former vice president as the “most electable” Democrat in the race. Trump is taking that claim seriously and he persists with allegations that Biden and his son, Hunter, are corrupt. Yet Biden isn’t stepping in the ring to fight.

At a recent SEIU event in Los Angeles, Biden angrily responded to a reporters’ question about the Ukraine-Biden imbroglio saying, “I’m not going to respond to it. I’m not going to talk about anything other than what the facts are. This is not about me, it’s not about my son. There’s not a shred of evidence that anything he’s done is wrong…[Trump’s] unhinged…I worry about what he’s going to do—not about me or my family—I’m worried about what he’ll do in next year of his presidency.” The press conference quickly devolved as Biden, finger-pointing and veins-bulging,—said “focus on this man [Trump].”

And this week, Biden joined every other major 2020 Democrat running for president in calling for Trump’s impeachment.

Still, that’s not enough for voters who desperately want a fighter, not a deflector, and it’s not enough to stop a political story that has many tentacles.

Democratic primary voters consistently say they want a candidate who can take on Trump. This is Biden’s chance to take it to Trump and be the fighter he claims to be.

At some point, Biden will have to return a punch at Trump and address this issue. The sooner he can, the better. It may make all the difference between winning the Democratic nomination (and possibly the presidency) or becoming another politician vanquished by Trump’s tricks.

This fight, this “bare-knuckle” bout with Trump is what Biden set himself up for in May, so why he is backing away?

Trump is giving the scrappy Scranton streetfighter a gift—by attacking Biden, and only Biden—Trump is making this election a two-person race.

Biden’s wish is being served up to him on a golden platter. In an ill-advised-over-abundance-of-caution, Biden is missing his chance to crowd out his competition by showing voters he can go toe-to-toe with Trump.

While it’s not easy to blame a father for laying low as the president of the United States attacks his son—Biden is burying his head in the sand.

A deflection strategy may have worked against any other candidate, but Trump isn’t just throwing a grenade and walking away—he’s setting up an outpost in the Democrats’ territory and lobbing grenade after grenade at Biden—often burning himself in the process.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, like a pinpoint laser beam, is focusing the impeachment inquiry narrowly on Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president and every time the media discusses the inquiry, Joe and Hunter Biden are likely to be invoked.

The media, rightfully so, will cover this conflict with new headlines every day provided that the Democratic House moves on with an impeachment inquiry and the president continues to toss those grenades without caution.

For Biden’s Democratic primary rivals, this story continues to bruise their main opponents—Trump and Biden. They will let this story drag on as long as possible in hopes of taking the Democratic frontrunner out of contention for the nomination while badly damaging Trump before the general election.

This story is enough to send Biden’s supporters to other Democratic candidates who may quickly become “more electable” as Biden dithers.

Trump’s strategy—to take Biden out—is working. Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic contenders also continue to chip away at Biden. But this race is far from over and if Biden can successfully answer Trump’s attacks while throwing a strong counterpunch, he can crowd out the other Democrats and make this effectively a two-person race.

Democratic primary voters consistently say they want a candidate who can take on Trump. This is Biden’s chance to take it to Trump and be the fighter he claims to be.

No single tweet, no statement, and no TV ad from Team Biden is going to put this to bed. Trump’s thirst for a fight will only become more emboldened with Biden’s silence. Biden must directly confront Trump if he hopes to win the nomination. Doing so will put every other Democratic contender in their shadows while he and Trump begin the inevitable slog to election day 2020.

Biden can make this a two-person race, the election he asked for during his kickoff speech in May, but he must shed his over-calculated caution, openly defend his name, his family, and his candidacy and repeatedly confront Trump head-on.

Until Biden opens Trump’s gift, the Trump fog machine will continue to choke him out and allow other candidates to vie for their own bare-knuckle fight with Trump."

A standout moment of the June 27 Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GET HEALTH CARE, SAY DEMS IN NIGHT 2 DEBATE

Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it “the end of the race.”

But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year.

While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally.

The CIS study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare.

The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637.

If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.”

These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress.

“Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.”

Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats.

AOC PUSHES NATIONAL RENT CONTROL, WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN LATEST MASSIVE PROPOSAL

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.”

Among those bills is “The Embrace Act,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally.

""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads.

The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”"

“This won’t be decided by the debates. What I hear from folks time and time again is nothing meaningful came out of these debates and they’re often disconnected from peoples’ lives,” Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said Friday.

Bullock spoke with reporters from Fox News, NBC News, and NPR after headlining the ""Politics and Eggs"" speaking series, a must-stop for White House hopefuls in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire.

BULLOCK ACCUSES STEYER OF BUYING HIS WAY ONTO DEBATE STAGE

Bullock, who launched his campaign in the late spring, qualified for the second round of debates but didn’t reach the Democratic National Committee’s polling and fundraising criteria to make the cut for last month’s showdown or Tuesday’s debate, which will be held in Ohio.

The DNC’s raising the thresholds again for candidates to make the stage for November’s fifth round showdown, which will be held in Atlanta.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is in a similar situation. He jumped into the race relatively late and qualified for the first two rounds of debates, but didn’t make the stage last month and won’t be in the debate spotlight next week.

“I had to make a decision on the debate stage, whether I was going to keep laundering money through Facebook to try to stay on a debate stage that was pre-season football, that wasn’t going to make a difference in the standings, or whether I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Bennet explained in an interview on Tuesday with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com.

“I decided I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire at a time when they were going to start paying attention to this race,” he emphasized.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Twelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday’s showdown. Bullock, Bennet, and four other contenders in the still extremely large but shrinking field of Democratic White House hopefuls failed to make the cut.

Most of the lower-tier candidates have fired away for months at the DNC for their debate criteria, arguing it’s unfair and winnows the field of candidates before voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – the first four states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar, get to cast their ballots.

A slightly more diplomatic Bullock said on Thursday that “the DNC was well-intentioned but I don’t think the best example is for campaigns to be spending $50 or $60 to get each individual donor…. I don’t think that’s the best way to pick a candidate or nominee.”

Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chair Tom Perez told Fox News last month that the process has been “eminently fair” and added “we’re going “to continue to be transparent.”

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard - who failed to qualify for last month’s debate but made the stage for next week’s showdown - announced on Thursday that she may boycott next Tuesday’s debate.

GABBARD THREATENS TO BOYCOTT DEBATE TO PROTEST DNC

The congresswoman from Hawaii accused the DNC and its national media debate partners of “rigging” the primary battle against many of the lower-tier candidates and political outsiders running for the nomination.

“I am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media’s effort to rig 2020 primary,” she tweeted.

Even though he’s not making the stage, Bullock says he’s marching on. He told Fox News he has enough campaign cash to survive until the first votes in the early voting states in February.

“We’re still 120 days out from any voter expressing preference. I still think there’s a lot of time for this,” he stressed.

And Bennet took aim at the top-tier contenders for the nomination, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

“I think the support for the leaders in the race is very, very soft, maybe as soft as it’s ever been at this stage of the race,” he predicted."

Zuckerberg was speaking during a recent livestreamed question-and-answer session with Facebook employees when he made the surprising assertion.

Asked to respond to Sanders' declaration that billionaires should not exist, Zuckerberg – the fifth richest person in the world – offered his unexpected take.

ZUCKERBERG SIDES WITH BERNIE SANDERS ON BILLIONAIRES

“I understand where he’s coming from,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level, no one deserves to have that much money.”

Lahren went after the billionaire, slamming him for his ""hypocritical"" support of Sanders and his call to prevent Americans from attaining ""billionaire"" status.

""Looks like slamming capitalism, while benefiting from capitalism, is quite lucrative ... I’m sure it is easy for you to sit in one of your 10 properties and ponder whether you deserve it...while basking in it all,"" she said.

FACEBOOK CEO THREATENS LAWSUIT AGAINST ELIZABETH WARREN

Later in the segment, Lahren applauded Zuckerberg's plan to donate 99 percent of his Facebook shares to charity, specifically the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative – which uses technology to solve challenges like eradicating disease and reforming the criminal justice system – but noted that his decision to do so represented the very premise on which capitalism was founded on.

""That’s fantastic,"" said Lahren, ""but in a way, this only makes my point. Zuckerberg was able to achieve and attain his billions by working hard – harder than most – taking chances, building a company and a mega-brand via innovation and capitalist principles,"" she said.

""Think Facebook could have been founded in Cuba or Venezuela? Think again,"" she continued, referring to countries ruled largely by socialism.

Later in the segment, Lahren doubled down on her praise of the current capitalist structure in the U.S. and warned against redistribution of wealth.

""Zuck chooses to donate huge sums of his money the way he sees fit — not by government dictate or mandate. Would he prefer to pledge that estimated $67 billion in Facebook stock to the U.S. government? Send it to the swamp so the bureaucrats could divvy it up the way they see fit? I don’t think so,"" the Fox Nation host said.

BARR ASKS FACEBOOK CEO TO STOP END-TO-END ENCRYPTION PROGRAMS

""Whether Zuck wants to admit it or not,"" she continued, ""he knows taxation, confiscation and over-regulation kill innovation. He also believes he knows how to spend his money better than the almighty government. He lives his life like a compassionate capitalist and still feels like he must bow down to wannabe socialists like Bernie Sanders. Ridiculous,"" said Lahren.

The Fox Nation host reiterated her point, expressing support for hard work and unlimited financial potential — and urged liberals to ""butt out.""

""I am sick of these liberals telling us what we deserve and don't deserve,"" she concluded. ""This is America, we deserve what we work hard to earn ... butt out.""

Gavin Newsom on Friday signed legislation effect… [+4273 chars]","California is banning its use of for-profit prisons, a method it once embraced as a means to ease overcrowding but has since drawn the scorn of prisoner and immigrant advocacy groups over substandard conditions and alleged abuses.",2019-10-11,Fox News,California bans private prisons and immigrant detention centers,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-bans-private-prisons-and-immigrant-detention-centers,"California is banning the use of for-profit prisons, once embraced to ease overcrowding, but now scorned by prisoner and immigrant advocacy groups over substandard conditions and alleged abuses.

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed legislation effectively banning the outsourcing of inmates to private contractors. The law will prohibit the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation from entering into or renewing contracts with private-prison corporations beginning in 2020 and bars the state from keeping prisoners in private lockups starting in 2028.

""These for-profit prisons do not reflect our values,"" Newsom said in a statement.

The Democratic governor promised to end the use of private prisons upon taking office in January. The state's prison system was already phasing them out, despite having to comply with an inmate population cap imposed by federal judges.

THE COLD HARD FACTS ABOUT AMERICA'S PRIVATE PRISON SYSTEM

California houses around 1,600 inmates in three prisons run by Florida-based GEO Group, according to the corrections department. Its contract expires in 2023, at which time it will not be able to renew it under the new law.

California ended its last out-of-state private prison contract over the summer when it moved its final 33 inmates from Arizona to an in-state facility. At one point, Californa had contracts with five other out-of-state prisons, The Sacramento Bee reported.

""By ending the use of for-profit, private prisons and detention facilities, we are sending a powerful message that we vehemently oppose the practice of profiteering off the backs of Californians in custody, that we will stand up for the health, safety and welfare of our people, and that we are committed to humane treatment for all,"" Assemblyman Rob Bonta, an Oakland Democrat and the bill's lead author, said in a statement.

The measure also bans privately-run immigration detention centers, which house illegal immigrants awaiting deportation hearings. Advocates and Democratic lawmakers have railed against using the facilities to hold immigrants, citing poor conditions.

ELIZABETH WARREN CALLS TO BAN PRIVATELY RUN FEDERAL PRISONS

A Homeland Security watchdog report found that immigrants were being crowded into cells and many had trouble accessing medical care, showers, clothes and mental health care.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) currently houses 4,000 illegal immigrants in four private detention facilities throughout the state. The largest facility, in Adelanto, has a temporary contract set to expire next year, along with another in Bakersfield.

""Within the next one to five years, private immigration detention will be abolished for good in California,"" said Christina Fialho, co-founder of Freedom for Immigrants.

An ICE spokesperson told Fox News the agency will most likely transfer detainees to ""a greater distance from their arrest location.""

""Thus, the only impact would be felt by the residents of California who would be forced to travel greater distances to visit friends and family in custody,"" the spokesperson said. ""The idea that a state law can bind the hands of a federal law enforcement agency managing a national network of detention facilities is wrong.""

Opponents of for-profit prison argue the model incentivizes mass incarceration. The industry has come under a microscope due to reports of poor living conditions and the alleged lack of inmate protections.

“These Wall Street-owned for-profit, private facilities inhumanely treat people as commodities. These companies are incentivized to maximize profits and minimize costs — including the important 'costs' of investments in programs, services and rehabilitation efforts that reduce recidivism rates and increase success for Californians upon their reentry into society,” said Assemblyman Bonta.

California became dependent on private prisons after a federal court ruled in 2009 that the state had to reduce its prison population to 137.5 percent of intended capacity, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The state has nearly 130,000 prison inmates, with another 82,220 in local jails. As of 2017, it spent $13.5 billion on correction expenditures annually, according to The Sentencing Project.

With the ban, California joins New York, Illinois and Iowa in implementing restrictions on private prisons.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y.

City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a “no show” in the district.

“Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it’s going to be a moderate Democrat,” Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. “She’s a no-show in the district. She hasn’t brought about anything except division within the party.”

“Socialism doesn’t work,"" Cabrera added. ""I don’t want it for my children, for my grandchildren.""

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AND WARREN GAIN GROUND IN DEMOCRATIC RACE

He said he decided to run after becoming fed up with Ocasio-Cortez’s railing against Amazon’s plans to build a headquarters in Queens-- plans Amazon pulled out because of backlash from New York City lawmakers.

“It was staggering to me,” Cabrera said. “We have somebody who literally dismantled the possibility of us having 25,000 jobs, and she has yet to bring any jobs into the district.”

Cabrera could face attacks over his past views on gay rights. According to Politico, a video surfaced in 2014 of Cabrera praising Uganda’s restrictive anti-gay laws. In response, Cabrera, who is also a pastor, pointed out that he has voted in favor of every piece of legislation supported by the LGBT caucus while on New York's city council.

Cabrera was first elected to the city council in 2009, and he lives about a mile outside of the district which he is running to represent. Cabrera told City and State NY “I’ve done more for the Bronx and Queens than [Ocasio-Cortez] ever has.” Cabrera was a registered Republican until 2008.

A number of Republicans have entered the race to challenge Ocasio-Cortez, but Cabrera is the first well-known Democrat to do so.

Cabrera's complaints about Ocasio-Cortez echo those of Republican Scherie Murray, a businesswoman who emigrated from Jamaica and entered the race against Ocasio-Cortez in July.

""There is a crisis in Queens, and it’s called AOC,” Murray told Fox News at the time. “And instead of focusing on us, she’s focusing on being famous. Mainly rolling back progress and authoring the job-killing Green New Deal and killing the Amazon New York deal.”

Four other Republicans have filed to run for the seat as well-- former police officer John Cummings, medical journalist Ruth Papazian, construction contractor Miguel Hernandez and entrepreneur Antoine Tucker."

The man, identified by Extinction Rebellion as former Paralympic cyclist James Brown, was seen clinging to the aircraft in a video streamed online by the protest group. Brown, who is visually impaired, was arrested at Heathrow last month after a protest which saw some Extinction Rebellion activists try to fly a drone near the airport. The 54-year-old, who won a bronze medal at London 2012, glued himself to the top of a British Airways Embraer 190 jet.

AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS HIT MAJOR CITIES IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, MORE THAN 300 ARRESTED

“Here I am on top of a f****** airplane at City Airport. I hate heights, I’m s******* myself, I managed to get on the roof. I am so shaky,” he said in a Facebook video.

“This is all about the climate and ecological crisis, we’re protesting against government inaction on climate and ecological breakdown. They declare a climate emergency and then do nothing about it.

“In fact they go the opposite direction, they sanction the expansion of airports, Heathrow, Bristol and others. We can’t let this go on, we can’t have our cake and eat it.”

He later noticed security were approaching and said, “Oh good security are coming. I hope they don’t take too long because this is f****** scary.”

He was eventually removed. A spokeswoman for British Airways said, “We are investigating what happened as a matter of urgency.” Meanwhile another protester managed to ground a flight from London City Airport to Dublin today — to the fury of the passengers on board. The Aer Lingus flight this morning was on the runway and about to take off when a smartly dressed man stood up and gave a lecture on climate change.

Filming himself on his phone, the man said, “I don’t wish to travel with you, but I don’t wish to get off. I’m extremely sorry for the inconvenience.”

Furious passengers responded saying, “You’re not sorry at all.” As their flight was held up, travelers pleaded with crew to remove the bespectacled man from the plane.

Continuing to address those on board, the man said, “We have two generations of human civilization left if we carry on doing what we are doing.”

Another passenger then asked him, “Why are you filming yourself?”

The man was later seen being led away from the aircraft by police officers. The flight, scheduled to depart at 9.40am, was delayed by 10 minutes.

Passenger Warren Swalbe tweeted, “Just about to take from London City airport. Our flight was infiltrated by a climate change protester.”

Nicholas Watt, the political editor of BBC Newsnight, wrote, “My flight from London City airport to Dublin has just been grounded by a climate change protester. On runway and about to take off when smartly dressed man in late middle age stood up with iPhone to deliver lecture on climate change up and down aisle.

“Cabin crew calmly and very politely asked protester to resume his seat. Politely but persistently he declined and proceeded to deliver his lecture on climate change in aisle. Plane was at the end of runway. So the pilot taxied back to gate where plane was met by throng of police. They came on board and escorted the protester off the plane.

“The final irony of the climate protest on our flight. We cannot take off until we have taken on extra fuel … to replace the fuel used up during the protest, our pilot notes with humor.”

Aer Lingus said the passenger was removed “due to disruptive behavior on board” and a full security check of the aircraft was completed before the plane departed.

The climate change group started their three-day “Hong Kong-style” shut down of London City Airport this morning, gluing themselves to the terminal building and dancing on a roof — but ultimately failing to cancel flights.

The latest protest is against the climate impact of flying and the government’s ongoing support of airport expansion. Hundreds of environmentalists attempted to block the entrance to the airport from the DLR by sitting together on the ground and singing “Fly today, gone tomorrow”.

Activist Phil Kingston, 83, was among those arrested — the third time he has been arrested as part of Extinction Rebellion protests in the past week.

Protesters were seen being dragged out the airport by officers after failing to break through security into the terminal. One was heard saying, “Please stop you’re hurting me.”

One activist climbed onto part of the roof of the terminal building where he was cheered by fellow protesters. Standing on the roof, he bellowed down, “Shut the airport down! Rebellion!”

He then danced on the roof as a live band played clarinet music below.

Those arriving for flights were redirected to a second terminal entrance by security workers and were not allowed to enter the building without showing their boarding cards first.

Taxi driver Jason Lempiere said that the protests had disrupted his work in and around the city. “It’s disturbing everyone’s everyday life — working, travel in and out of the airport. Yeah, have a voice, but not disrupt people’s lives like this,” he said.

* Louisiana will hold its first round of balloting tomorrow in its gubernatorial race, and Donald Trump will visit the state tonight to rally the Republican troops. Incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) is expected to outpace his GOP rivals, and if Edwards tops the 50% threshold tomorrow, there will be no second round of voting next month.

* Speaking of presidential travel, Trump was in Minneapolis last night for an unusually long campaign rally, at which he attacked all kinds of foes, targeting Joe Biden with particular zeal.

* Former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was planning a comeback next year, but now that he appears to be “Congressman-1” in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman – Rudy Giuliani’s associates who were arrested this week – the Texan’s political future is again in doubt.

* On a related note, many of the Republicans who received contributions from Parnas and Fruman are scrambling to either give the money back or donate it to charity.

* While most national Democratic presidential primary polls show Joe Biden’s lead over Elizabeth Warren disappearing, Fox News’ latest national poll shows the former vice president leading the Massachusetts senator, 32% to 22%. Bernie Sanders is third in the poll with 17%. (Also of interest, Beto O’Rourke reached 3% in the Fox poll, which moves him a little closer to qualifying for the party’s November primary debate.)

* As for the general election, Fox’s poll found Biden and Warren leading Trump by 10 points each, while Sanders leads the president in a hypothetical match-up by nine points.

* Forty-five years ago, Rep. Larry Hogan Sr. (R-Md.) was the first Republican on the House Judiciary Committee to vote to impeach Richard Nixon. Yesterday, his son, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan Jr. (R), announced his support for Congress’ impeachment inquiry into Trump.

* And in a bit of a surprise, House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) announced yesterday that she’ll retire at the end of this Congress. Her district, which Hillary Clinton carried by 20 points, is expected to remain in Democratic hands."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., received a chorus of praise on Thursday after she dunked on traditional beliefs about marriage -- but was the proverbial pitch grooved to her by a friendly donor?

The man who asked that question was Morgan Cox III, who sits on the Board of Directors for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). HRC is the organization that co-hosted CNN's ""LGBTQ Town Hall"" on Thursday and happens to be one of the nation's foremost advocacy groups on the issue. The event was closed to the public and only included invited guests, stakeholders in the movement, and members of “civic organizations,” according to the group.

Donor data also revealed that a man matching Cox's profile donated at least $5,400 to Warren in 2017 and 2018: A Morgan Cox III from Plano, Texas, gave $2,700 to Warren in July of 2017, $1,000 in April of 2018, and another $1,700 that same April.

When Cox was introduced on Thursday, CNN described him as someone tied to a ""real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas."" Both Cox's Linkedin profile and HRC's website say he's based in Plano, Texas. His Linkedin profile also notes that he works as a partner at Marquis Group, a real estate firm based in Texas.

ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS SHE WON'T HOLD 'BIG DOLLAR FUNDRAISERS' NO MATTER HOW MUCH TRUMP RAISES

Cox, on Thursday, prompted a catchy response from Warren after he asked her: ""Let's say you're on the campaign trail ... and a supporter approaches you and says, 'Senator, I am old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.' What is your response?""

""Well, I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that,"" Warren told Cox, drawing laughter from the audience. ""And I'm going to say, 'Then just marry one woman.'""

After more laughter and applause, Warren let loose an apparent jab at the hypothetical supporters. ""Assuming you can find one,"" she quipped, turning and rubbing her hands together.

Online, Warren experienced an outpouring of support. ""Elizabeth Warren had a perfect zinger at CNN’s LGBTQ town hall when asked about gay marriage,"" New York Magazine declared on Friday.

HRC is perhaps most well-known for its simple equality logo which features a yellow ""equals"" sign against a blue backdrop. Its mission statement reads: ""HRC strives to end discrimination against LGBTQ people and realize a world that achieves fundamental fairness and equality for all.""

The group has clashed with conservatives on issues surrounding religious liberty. It previously lambasted certain laws as ""cruel"" because they allowed religious adoption agencies to obtain exemptions from serving same-sex couples. In an op-ed from August of 2018, the organization's president compared Trump's Religious Liberty Task Force to oppressive tactics African-Americans faced during the Civil Rights era.

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have called for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren asked Belfort to weigh in on the current 2020 Democratic field, as many of the leading candidates have long criticized the financial industry.

""If one of these people gets into office, it will be a Warren or Sanders destruction.” — Jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amok, it gets really ugly,"" said Belfort. ""What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… but the policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said.

However, Belfort said that he believed that Trump will emerge with a victory in 2020.

“If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, OK? Because I think that this nation would be literally destroyed,"" he said. ""If one of these people gets into office—a Warren or Sanders—destruction.”

“He's a great salesman,"" Belfort continued, praising the president.

""I wish that he would say things in a way that p*** people off less because it doesn't help… but I can’t judge because he's president. I didn't become president, he did. I went to jail.”

Later in the episode, Belfort opened up about his notorious financial rise, devastating downfall, and how his time in prison helped reinvent his future.

“Of course, I'm remorseful about what happened,"" said Belfort, responding to Lahren, who questioned whether he regretted his past actions.

“I deserved to go to jail,"" Belfort continued. ""I definitely deserved to go to jail, it was a positive experience,” he recalled. “I thought the judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really [make sure]… I'll never forget—that was terrible. Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.”

Belfort was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which shed light on his early life and white-collar crimes that led to his eventual time in prison.

After serving 22 months between 2004 and 2006 for securities fraud totaling over $200 million, Belfort was also ordered to return $110 million to investors.

Following his time in prison, Belfort worked on his sobriety and began to write his book -- which would serve as a basis for the film. Belfort described becoming sober and writing the book as pivotal experiences in his path to rehabilitation.

“When I wrote the book it was like… self-therapy to look back and examine all your actions… I love the movie—obviously, some things were fictionalized to serve the narrative so to speak… There are some things that bothered me that I thought made me look worse than I was and other things that probably didn't look as bad as I was,” Belfort recalled.

The 2013 film reportedly made an estimated $400 million worldwide and gained Belfort widespread recognition, kicking off his second career as a motivational speaker.

The 2020 hopeful announced Saturday that her campaign submitted an ad that claimed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg endorsed Trump's re-election.

Facebook quickly approved the ad, showing, according to Warren, that the platform's new rules had turned the social media giant into a ""disinformation-for-profit machine.""

The ad itself eventually discloses that the Zuckerberg endorsement is false and quickly pivots to a warning about Trump. ""If Trump lies in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks,"" she said.

QUESTION THAT PROMPTED WARREN'S VIRAL ANSWER AT TOWN HALL MIGHT HAVE COME FROM SUPPORTIVE DONOR

""Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate,"" she said in another tweet. ""They’ve decided to let political figures lie to you—even about Facebook itself—while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies.""

She went on to claim that Trump's campaign spent $1 million per week on Facebook ads, allegedly including some that wouldn't air on television because they contained false claims.

""Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once through negligence. Now, they've changed their policy so they can profit from lies to the American people,"" she said before linking to a petition calling for Zuckerberg to be held ""accountable.""

In a statement provided to Fox News, Facebook defended its stance on not censoring political speech. “Facebook believes political speech should be protected. If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,"" a company spokesperson said.

Facebook also pointed to an FCC guideline requiring neutrality in hosting content.

The guideline reads: ""Except as other-wise indicated in § 73.1944, no station licensee is required to permit the use of its facilities by any legally qualified candidate for public office, but if any licensee shall permit any such candidate to use its facilities, it shall afford equal opportunities to all other candidates for that office to use such facilities. Such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast by any such candidate.""

The company previously rejected former Vice President Joe Biden's request to take down a critical ad from the Trump campaign. According to The New York Times, the company defended its decision in a letter to Biden's campaign. Warren's tweet appeared to refer to that particular ad, which both CNN and NBC refused to air.

“Our approach is grounded in Facebook’s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,"" wrote Katie Harbath, the company's head of global elections policy.

Warren's stunt came as Facebook faced criticism from conservatives and progressives alike. Conservatives have long railed against social media platforms for apparently showing greater scrutiny over their content and unnecessarily censoring certain information.

Progressives, like Warren, have warned that Facebook could easily be leveraged to help Republicans win re-election. A long-running argument by Democrats is that Russia used Facebook to help Trump win the 2016 election.

Warren, in particular, has taken aim at the social media giant, vowing to break up the company and combat its allegedly anti-competitive practices.

Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, blasted the Democrat's ad as a ""political stunt"" and said it ""won't distract from Warren's primary goal: giving government the control of your health care and hiking everyone's taxes to pay for it."""

On the roster: Biden buoyed amid Trump attacks - Giuliani’s woes mount - Trump legal team trashes Gowdy - Dems divided on timing of impeachment vote - ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge’



BIDEN BUOYED AMID TRUMP ATTACKS

Fox News: “Together Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren capture the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election. Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.”



Biden’s firewall still strong - WaPo: “[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary. Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston … gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is ‘too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.’ And she doesn’t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.”



Will any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? - NYT: “It’s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden’s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son’s work and his service as vice president. … So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. … In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden’s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive… Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged — in false ways — by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats’ ire.”



Jane Sanders takes starring role in husband’s campaign - NYT: “When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. … When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders … stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, ‘especially me,’ had told him to slow down. … In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be ‘egotistical’ to call herself Mr. Sanders’s top adviser but allowed that she was ‘very much a close adviser.’ Above all, she said, she was ‘his wife.’”



Voter intensity on both sides through the roof - Gallup: “A year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given ‘quite a lot of thought’ to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.”

“It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite. These are cases where the most useful intelligence may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be relieved from apprehensions of discovery.” – John Jay, Federalist No. 64



TIME OUT: ‘A STATUE OF FLORENTINE BRONZE’

Paris Review: “In the late summer of 1866, a black equestrian stuntwoman made her Paris debut and galvanized the city. She was known only as ‘Sarah the African,’ and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, ‘the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,’ ‘an Ethiopian,’ or ‘a statue of Florentine bronze.’ A ‘negress’ who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by Georges Cuvier just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer’s hit posthumous opera, L’Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. … On her debut in September she was billed above Méphistophélès the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman, William Meyer, and even above Mlle Adèle, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.”

GIULIANI’S WOES MOUNT

ABC News: “The business relationship between President Donald Trump's private lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the men charged Thursday in a campaign finance scheme is a subject of the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by federal authorities in New York, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The investigation became public after the FBI had to quickly move to arrest Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman before they boarded a flight out of the country from Washington Dulles Airport with one-way tickets. They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.”



Former Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign - AP: “Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was ‘abruptly’ recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a ‘concerted campaign against me’ and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. ‘Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,’ Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.”



Report: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client - WaPo: “President Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic ‘deal’ to stop the U.S. case against Reza Zarrab on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson — including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.”



Pete Session’s political revival threatened by Ukraine role - NYT: “Former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as ‘Congressman-1’ in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani… Mr. Sessions’s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.”



Continetti: We are all Ukrainians - Free Beacon: “From Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.”



TRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY

Yahoo: “The president’s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president, Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard. ‘Trey Gowdy doesn’t know s***,’ she said. … ‘He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, ‘Well, if you’ve done nothing wrong, just talk to Bob Mueller.’’ Toensing and her husband, Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump’s legal team.”



And he can’t even join until January - WashEx: “Former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, ‘Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there’s a problem with, he can’t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.’ It was only a day after Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. … Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession, federal law prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.”



DEMS DIVIDED ON TIMING OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “House Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not holding a vote authorizing the House’s impeachment proceedings — arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate. Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump’s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn’t changed, describing the idea as the latest ‘Republican canard’ in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. … Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately — and, to a lesser extent, publicly — that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats’ unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.”



House members get an earful from voters back home - Politico: “The ‘Make America Great Again’ hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep. Anthony Brindisi’s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. … Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can’t avoid it. … But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves — serving as the party’s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats’ chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.”



Independents’ support for impeachment jumps 10 points - NPR: “A slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split — 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.”



ROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP

Politico: “President Donald Trump wants to sideline Mitt Romney — but the Utah senator isn’t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 — headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner and Michigan Senate hopeful John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney’s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump’s efforts to ostracize him.”



Dems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat - NYT: “Ms. [Nita] Lowey’s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman, David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that ‘if someone were to step down or retire,’ she would ‘have to think if it’s the right choice for me.’ Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey’s district: Her parents’ house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district. Ms. Clinton herself does not live in Westchester, but congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent. A representative for Ms. Clinton did not return a request for comment. Mr. Buchwald said he would make an announcement within a few days.”



Ocasio-Cortez draws credible primary challenger - Fox News: “A prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives seat currently held by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a ‘no show’ in the district. ‘Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it’s going to be a moderate Democrat,’ Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. ‘She’s a no-show in the district. She hasn’t brought about anything except division within the party.’ ‘Socialism doesn’t work,’ Cabrera added.”



Pompeo ally steps aside in Kansas Senate race - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas business leader with longtime ties to Mike Pompeo will not run for U.S. Senate after weighing a bid for months — renewing speculation about whether the secretary of state will enter the race. Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, in the past has said he would defer to Pompeo if the chief diplomat decided to mount a campaign. Cobb, a former Koch Industries lobbyist, advised Pompeo in 2014 during a congressional primary battle against former Rep. Todd Tiahrt. He made no mention of Pompeo in a lengthy statement Thursday announcing his decision. Cobb said that ‘after months of serious deliberation, analysis, and careful and prayerful consideration with friends, colleagues and my family, I have decided that the best place for me to pursue my passion is to remain as the President and CEO of the Kansas Chamber.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I need your help. I don’t get what is going on with the Syria/Turkey situation. I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn’t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don’t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn’t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.” – E’Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa



[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small – measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey’s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president’s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks’ zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]



“I am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as ‘news.’ But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question. That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong? Please explain! And keep up the good work!!!” – Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand



[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An “impeachment inquiry” is not a thing. It’s like a couple being “pre-engaged.” But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an “impeachment inquiry” and “impeachment” is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]



“All my teams have long gone home for the winter. So now we have your traditional Nine in the form of the quite surprising Cardinals playing your hometown Nationals (who should be the Senators and in the American League with Walter Johnson throwing flames, but oh, well). Where do your loyalties lie?” – Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.



[Ed. note: Hometown!? Washington, D.C.!? My place of residence, certainly. And I do love living here. But c’mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team. I admire the Nats’ pluck and am grateful for the chance they are affording me to watch the National League Championship Series in person. But I love the Cardinals and am absolutely over the moon with this year’s squad. What a bunch! The infield alone may be the greatest since my glory days of fandom in the mid-1980s. Matt Carpenter is an absolute rock for the team and the personification of professionalism, Paul DeJong is a clutch player (whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?) who seems like he was born to be a Cardinal, Kolten Wong surfs second base like the pros ride waves at Honoli’i in his hometown and Paul Goldschmidt has shown in his tenacity, play and quality of his character that he is truly in the right uniform. And Yadi is nothing less than a national treasure. So suffice it to say: Viva el Birdos!]



“How ‘bout them Redbirds! We miss you on Twitter where we could delight in the pure joy emanating from Cardinals gifs, memes, and tweets after a playoff series win…but the mailbag will have to do!” – Jack Whiteman, St. Louis

‘THIS IS A NUDGE TO PICK UP THE FUDGE’

AP: “Officials in a southwest Missouri city are planting small flags in piles of abandoned dog poop as part of a campaign to get residents to clean up after their pets downtown. The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, ‘Is this your turd? ‘Cuz that's absurd’ and ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.’ The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides. One has an instinctive feeling that religion has a place in American public life, and that both sides misunderstand it—that between sectarianism and secularism lies something else.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the New Republic on April 9, 1984.

“Is it getting hot in here, or just the elevating public consciousness around rampant wealth inequality?” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked via Twitter earlier this year. According to AOC’s House website, she contends that income inequality is “being used by those in power to amplify fear and anger in our communities and further divide us.”

“When you’ve got a government, when you’ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn’t doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple,” the Massachusetts Democrat says. She argues that “Inequality is rapidly growing, transforming rule by-the-people into rule by-wealthy-elites” and “many American politicians seem to accept — even embrace — the politics of division and resentment.”

AOC and Warren are right, to a point: Income inequality, indeed, has grown on President Trump’s watch. And the numbers back them up.

The key metric here is called the Gini coefficient. A 0.00 score represents perfect income equality; neither rich nor poor exist, since everyone has identical incomes. A 1.00 Gini coefficient represents perfect income inequality: The rich earn all the money, and nobody else makes a penny.

Appearing on MSNBC, Sharpton said that Biden had support among black voters in South Carolina but that was based on the fact he served in former President Barack Obama's administration.

""A lot of Biden's support in South Carolina is African-American voters,"" Sharpton said, referring to one of the early primary states. ""But a lot of that is based on -- he was Barack Obama's vice president.""

""If there is an upset in Iowa, or even a close vote, and New Hampshire and it appears that Elizabeth Warren is the one that can beat Donald Trump, a lot of that vote will switch because a lot of the pro-Biden vote or the pro-any of the Democrats votes are based on anti-Trump,"" Sharpton said.

AL SHARPTON BLASTS DEMOCRATS HE CLAIMS DO NOT DO ENOUGH ON RACE ISSUES: 'WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR NEW SLAVE MASTERS'

Sharpton's comments came as polling showed Warren beating Biden in key states before the 2020 Democratic nomination. Polling also continued showing those two dominating the field of potential Democratic candidates.

Together, Biden and Warren have captured the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election.

Biden is on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Warren at 22 percent -- up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June.

The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.

Pointing to a recent Fox News Poll showing Biden continuing to lead Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Lane expressed surprise at the ex-vice president's performance.

""I'm a little surprised because there has been so much in the press about how Warren is charging,"" he said.

In addition, Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt said Biden continues to nonetheless hold a strong position as a candidate in the ""non-socialist, less insane lane"" of the primary contest.

He projected the Democrats' eventual nominee will come from that side of the party.

In a recent New Hampshire radio interview, Biden continued to deny engaging with his son about the 49-year-old's dealings in Ukraine.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

Maher also took aim at Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the foreign-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested this week on campaign finance charges before allegedly attempting to flee the U.S.

""This is the great irony of the Trump presidency,"" Maher said. ""Foreign criminals must be kept out of the country at all costs, unless they're here to steal our elections.""

On the Trump impeachment inquiry, and Republicans' reluctance to cooperate with Democrat-led House committees, Maher quipped: ""The president of the United States is going to be impeached because he treats subpoenas like parking tickets.""

Maher also made the case that Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were too ""far left"" to win the general election, and touted Sen. Amy Klobuchar as a ""dark horse"" who could potentially top the party's ticket.

Maher spoke to Klobuchar in a one-on-one interview. He argued that Klobuchar was ""plenty liberal"" but could actually beat President Trump.

""Obviously this is a fight between two wings of the party, which is almost every election. There is a center in the Democrat, a center-left wing. You're plenty liberal. You're plenty progressive,"" Maher told Klobuchar. ""And then there is a far-left which I think would be represented by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.""

Klobuchar would not address Warren and Sanders directly but clearly dismissed their platforms and pushed her center-left agenda.

""I want to win big and if someone is looking to kick one hundred forty nine million Americans off their current health insurance in four years then I'm not your candidate,"" Klobuchar said. ""If you want to use a bunch of hardworking people's money to send rich people's kids to college for free and I'm not your candidate. And just because people say ideas are bold doesn't mean they're bold. They may be bad.""

Maher also slammed former Vice President Joe Biden, saying he may be too old for the presidency, and that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., wasn't doing well in the polls -- despite the media attention she's received after debate performances.

Klobuchar ripped Trump on his Ukraine phone call before making a case for her candidacy, saying ""she could bring in moderate Republicans"" and ""win big."" She is currently polling at 2 percent in the latest national Fox News Poll.

In an awkward moment, Maher emphasized that Klobuchar being a woman might help her chances as well.

""I'm saying it's a lot easier to be on the center side of things, as Obama was, if you are not a white man,"" Maher tried to clarify. ""If you're a white straight man.""

Harris saw a bump in polling over the summer after she took Biden to task over his controversial comments about race. But since then, she's seen drops in multiple polls,

Harris recently faced criticism for calling on Twitter to suspend President Trump's account. The senator sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, accusing the president of violating the company's terms of service.

""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account,"" she said. ""When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing."""

Kamala Harris while moderating the network’s LGBTQ town hall in California earlier in the evening.

Cuomo, 49, began the Los Angeles event -- before an audience composed of members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities and their allies -- by welcoming Harris, D-Calif., to the stage.

Harris, following an LGBTQ custom, said her preferred pronouns were “she, her, and hers.""

“Mine too,” Cuomo quipped. But the comment drew negative reaction on social media.

""painfully awkward,"" one user wrote.

""It's cool that the dem nominees had an LGBTQ town hall where nobody challenged Chris Cuomo's disrespectful trans joke,"" another observer wrote.

Cuomo later apologized on Twitter, writing: “PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize.

“I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall,” he wrote.

But even Cuomo's apology drew backlash.

""Fredo Cuomo grovels to the intolerant left like a good puppy,"" one commenter wrote.

Aside from Harris, eight other Democratic 2020 contenders took part in the CNN event.

Former Vice President Joe Biden began a sentence saying, “When I came out … ,” using a phrase commonly employed by those publicly identifying as LGBTQ for the first time.

“That would be news,” CNN's Anderson Cooper interjected, prompting Biden to walk across the stage to embrace him.



“I got something to tell you ... ,” Biden started to joke to Cooper, who is gay.

“I kind of figured it out a while ago,” Cooper replied.

Biden also responded to a question from Shannon Scott, a 10-year U.S. Air Force veteran, who claimed she had to choose between serving in the military and her identity as a transgender woman because of the Trump administration's policy on those diagnosed with gender dysphoria serving in the military.

Biden said he would change the Trump policy if elected president.

""If I were president, you would not have to choose,"" he said. ""Not a joke. You would not have to choose. The fact of the matter is that we're in a position where transgender men and women are in a position where they should be able to do anything anybody else in the world can do. There should be no difference.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., addressed a comment she made in 2012, in which she said she did not support the use of taxpayer money to fund transgender reassignment surgery for prison inmates.

""It was a bad answer,” Warren told the audience. “And I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care they need. And that includes people who are transgender who, it is the time for them to have gender affirming surgery. I just think that’s important.""

Harris said she would make stopping the spread of HIV/AIDs within a decade one of her top priorities if she becomes president.

Other Democrats taking part were Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and businessman Tom Steyer."

BIDEN, WARREN, GAIN GROUND IN NEW FOX NEWS POLL

It’s a double-edged sword for the former vice president, with Trump’s allegations against Biden’s own Ukraine connection also in the spotlight.

Biden on Wednesday launched a forceful attack on the president – coming from a candidate who in recent weeks was anything but aggressive in calling for Trump’s impeachment, unlike most of his 2020 rivals.

“We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It’s no joke,” Biden emphasized during two speeches in New Hampshire. “He’s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.”

Biden’s announcement came one day after the White House vowed not to play ball with the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, but it also came as the former vice president lost his polling status as the unrivaled front-runner. Biden’s neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in most of the recent national and early-voting-state surveys, although he held a lead in the latest Fox News Poll.

FOR FIRST TIME, BIDEN CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT

And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

With those setbacks in mind, the unveiling of the more aggressive, in-your-face approach by Biden has been seen as considerably timely.

“It gets his sea legs under him,” noted Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden friend, adviser and fundraiser. “It gives everybody more energy.”

Rasky, who’s not directly involved in Biden’s 2020 campaign, predicted, “it’s definitely going to help fundraising.”

He added that donors “are happy to see Biden taking on the fight with intensity.”

Biden, in his speeches, taunted the president, claiming “he’s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November.”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran noted that such swagger would resonate with voters. She also said the Ukraine controversy put the spotlight on foreign relations, a wheelhouse for the former vice president.

“His remarks yesterday came across as an ‘enough is enough’ call to action and reminder to the American electorate of the fighter and statesman they have long known,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

The impeachment inquiry was sparked by Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was asking a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, Trump has insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no ""quid pro quo"" and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLAMS NY TIMES FOR OP-ED ON FORMER VP'S UKRAINE TIES

The president and allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on Biden and his son.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Biden also accused the president of throwing “lies and distortions and smears” at him and his son, “because he thinks he’ll undermine my candidacy for the nomination as well as the presidency if I am the nominee.”

While the Fox News national poll released Wednesday indicated that a majority said the president should be impeached and removed from office, Biden has faced warning signs of his own.

MAJORITY BACK TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IN LATEST FOX NEWS POLL

Thirty-six percent questioned in the survey said they found the Trump allegations against Biden extremely or very troubling. That included 34 percent of independents and even 24 percent of Democrats.

Longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed highlighted that “the discussion involving Ukraine is going to involve a continued focus on why Hunter Biden was being paid $50,000 a month to sit on the board of an energy company with him having absolutely no expertise in that area.”

Reed emphasized, “I think that crony capitalism does not sit well with voters in the center, right or left.”

And, Biden’s increased criticism aimed at the president likely will incite further attacks from Trump.

While the former vice president was speaking in New Hampshire, the president took to Twitter to return fire.

“So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!” Trump wrote."

NANCY PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S RALLY COMMENTS ABOUT BIDEN 'BEYOND THE PALE,' RIPS SENATE REPUBLICANS' 'COWARDICE' ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The question of recusal was raised by Rep. Thomas Masie, R-Ky., who asked if senators running for president “have a conflict of interest regarding possible impeachment of an opponent.”

House Democrats last month launched an impeachment inquiry into the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats allege that Trump was using U.S. military aid to push Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s conduct in the country. Trump has said there was no quid pro quo and that he wanted only to root out corruption.

But as the inquiry consumes Washington and the 2020 campaign trail, it is possible the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach the president in the coming months.

That would then set up an impeachment trial in the Senate, where a host of 2020 candidates -- including Sens. Klobuchar; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Michael Bennet, D-Colo.

It raises the question of whether they would benefit if their potential 2020 general election rival were removed from office -- and if so, if they should therefore recuse themselves from any trial.

“Shouldn’t they recuse themselves if it came to the Senate?” Massie asked. “Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law?”

Booker was asked on Friday if he would ever recuse himself, and he gave a short, simple answer: “No.”

In her answer, Klobuchar went into greater detail.

“I was elected as a U.S. senator for the state of Minnesota and my job will be to be a juror in the case and...I very strongly believe that this impeachment proceeding must go forward,” she said. “I don't know what counts that the House will come up with and what they will bring over to us but my job will be to look at the evidence and make a decision.”

Other senators have not addressed the question directly, but have no given any sign that they would recuse themselves. On Wednesday, Harris sent a letter with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to every Trump cabinet official demanding they cooperate with ongoing investigations and preserve relevent evidence."

Lots of major news organizations made the claim, interviewing supposed insiders – from CNN to The New Yorker and The Nation.

New Yorker Editor David Remnick rationalized the pushback against Trump in 2017: “The problem in Washington is not a Deep State; the problem is a shallow man – an untruthful, vain, vindictive, alarmingly erratic President.”

NEW BOOK CLAIMS ROD ROSENSTEIN THOUGHT JOHN KELLY AND JEFF SESSIONS WOULD BACK USE OF 25TH AMENDMENT AGAINST TRUMP

Now there’s no attempt at hiding it. In one of the more blatant impeachment stories of the week, New York Times columnist James B. Stewart went on NBC’s “Today” show to tell everyone that Trump is right. Stewart was pushing a new book, “Deep State,” only he sees the Deep Staters as heroes – the same way the rest of his media buddies do.

Co-host Savannah Guthrie tossed him a softball question, clearly amazed that Trump would call out the government employees who are trying to sabotage his administration.

“And his central allegation is that there are people inside these government agencies actively working against him,” Guthrie said to Stewart. “What did you find?” (Watch the video. Guthrie’s hand movements and inflection are a great example of how journalists manipulate a news story in ways that are hard to tell from transcripts.)

Guthrie got the answer Trump supporters already knew: Trump was right, but Stewart gave his own personal spin so viewers knew the good guys.

“Well, you meet these characters in my book, and the fact is, in a sense, he’s right,” Stewart said, referring to the president. “There is a Deep State, there is a bureaucracy in our country who has pledged to respect the Constitution, respect the rule of law.”

That’s pretty clear, despite Stewart’s attempt at making the Deep Staters seem honorable. “What Trump calls the Deep State in the United States is protecting the American people and protecting the Constitution. It’s a positive thing in this sense,” he added.

Only leftists see a government employee working to overturn the result of a legal election as “positive.”

For those of you following at home, that’s another media narrative destroyed. Bury it next to the Russia collusion hoax.

Of course there’s a Deep State. Americans know this, which is why they should doubt the “whistleblower” who didn’t even have firsthand information.

The biggest proponents of impeachment outside the Deep State are what we should probably call the Shallow Media. Take NBC’s histrionic Political Director Chuck Todd. Recently he was screaming that “A National Nightmare Is Upon Us!” (One other than watching NBC.) Now he’s upset about Americans having “two sets of realities.”

What he was really saying is a bunch of Americans dare to think for themselves and realize that Todd has lost any sense of neutrality.

Only leftists see a government employee working to overturn the result of a legal election as “positive.”

“There is a 40 percent of the country that is only getting fed one reality; arguably, 60 percent are getting what I would argue is reality,” Todd said.

Hubris is a symptom of bad journalism.

The same attitude was evident in a graphic used on-screen during “CNN Newsroom.” It said: “WH Declares War on Impeachment Inquiry & Constitution.” Media bias? At CNN? Never! It’s one thing to declare war on a bogus impeachment. It’s another thing to declare war on the Constitution.

But media outlets were more than willing to go all Schiff-ty and simply make things up.

In a memorable exchange, Trump tweeted how former President Barack Obama had said “he did not have the right to sign DACA” and did it anyway. Within minutes, the crafty folks at PolitiFact rated that “Mostly False.” But five minutes later, Washington Post White House reporter Seung Min Kim pointed out that PolitiFact was, in fact, wrong.

Then there’s one of my favorites: bias by omission. It’s not just the stupid and one-sided comments journalists make, it’s what they leave out.

For example, there’s the media fascination with former Secretary of State Colin Powell whining about “his party.” The problem is, NBC, MSNBC and CNN claimed “his party” was the Republicans, even though he’s endorsed Democrats for president three times in a row. He hasn’t backed a Republican for president since the 2004 election.

Pretty soon, they’ll be calling far-left Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a Republican because she was one until 20 years ago. (Yes, she really was.)

New allegations against Matt Lauer

The Matt Lauer disaster continues to shock even the most cynical media watchers. Investigative reporter Ronan Farrow’s new book “Catch and Kill” includes allegations that the former NBC “Today” host raped another NBC employee in a hotel room during the 2014 Olympics.

Farrow also slammed the network for blocking his investigation into movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. He eventually took his story to The New Yorker. Farrow alleged that Weinstein had tried to blackmail the network to make the story go away, claiming Weinstein “was aware of Lauer’s behavior and capable of revealing it.”

NBC cited the book in a story, saying it had reportedly “reached nondisclosure agreements with at least seven women who alleged harassment or discrimination at the company, including former employees with complaints about former ‘Today’ host Matt Lauer.”

Lauer denied the alleged rape but said he engaged in an “extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter.”

Facebook defends free speech

Social media companies are caught between a rock and a hard place. They hit the scene as free-speech venues and have gradually restricted speech more and more. Now Facebook has taken a positive step in support of free speech and many in the media don’t like it.

The Trump campaign created an ad about former Vice President Joe Biden’s involvement in Ukraine. The reaction was swift. CNN refused to run the ad and NBCUniversal (the folks dealing with the Lauer rape allegations) wouldn’t run it either.

Team Biden demanded Facebook take it down as well. But the company refused, arguing it doesn’t fact-check political speech.

The left and media were infuriated. The Washington Post headline showed the media mindset: “CNN won’t run two Trump campaign ads, citing ‘demonstrably false’ claims.” Facebook was supposed to follow CNN’s lead and didn’t.

Sen. Warren took out an ad showing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shaking hands with Trump and pretending “Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election.” She admitted it wasn’t true, but remained furious that Facebook wouldn’t play the role of referee so her campaign could try to ban Trump ads.

It might not seem like a big deal, but Facebook is facing constant calls to regulate speech. It’s nice to see the social media giant go all Nancy Reagan and “just say no!”

Mike Allen and Alayna Treene of Axios said this about the kickoff, “Biden has gone all-in on the general election, positioning himself as the eventual Democratic nominee rather than scrapping with the 19 other wannabes.”

From Day One Biden wanted to pick a fight directly with Trump. That’s a smart strategy for a presumptive frontrunner.

JOE BIDEN WILL BE DEMOCRATS' 'COLLATERAL DAMAGE' IN QUEST TO IMPEACH TRUMP, CHARLES LANE SAYS

“I know there are times when only a bare-knuckle fight will do,” Biden exclaimed in May the kickoff to cheers. At one point, the crowd even erupted in chants screaming, “We want Trump!” and Biden repeated “Beat Trump” three times to emphasize this message.

The Team Biden strategy became clear: elevate Biden above the fray of the Democratic Primary and cast him as the “most electable” fighter who can go toe-to-toe with Trump.

Since May, Biden’s surrogates have continuously touted the former vice president as the “most electable” Democrat in the race. Trump is taking that claim seriously and he persists with allegations that Biden and his son, Hunter, are corrupt. Yet Biden isn’t stepping in the ring to fight.

At a recent SEIU event in Los Angeles, Biden angrily responded to a reporters’ question about the Ukraine-Biden imbroglio saying, “I’m not going to respond to it. I’m not going to talk about anything other than what the facts are. This is not about me, it’s not about my son. There’s not a shred of evidence that anything he’s done is wrong…[Trump’s] unhinged…I worry about what he’s going to do—not about me or my family—I’m worried about what he’ll do in next year of his presidency.” The press conference quickly devolved as Biden, finger-pointing and veins-bulging,—said “focus on this man [Trump].”

And this week, Biden joined every other major 2020 Democrat running for president in calling for Trump’s impeachment.

Still, that’s not enough for voters who desperately want a fighter, not a deflector, and it’s not enough to stop a political story that has many tentacles.

Democratic primary voters consistently say they want a candidate who can take on Trump. This is Biden’s chance to take it to Trump and be the fighter he claims to be.

At some point, Biden will have to return a punch at Trump and address this issue. The sooner he can, the better. It may make all the difference between winning the Democratic nomination (and possibly the presidency) or becoming another politician vanquished by Trump’s tricks.

This fight, this “bare-knuckle” bout with Trump is what Biden set himself up for in May, so why he is backing away?

Trump is giving the scrappy Scranton streetfighter a gift—by attacking Biden, and only Biden—Trump is making this election a two-person race.

Biden’s wish is being served up to him on a golden platter. In an ill-advised-over-abundance-of-caution, Biden is missing his chance to crowd out his competition by showing voters he can go toe-to-toe with Trump.

While it’s not easy to blame a father for laying low as the president of the United States attacks his son—Biden is burying his head in the sand.

A deflection strategy may have worked against any other candidate, but Trump isn’t just throwing a grenade and walking away—he’s setting up an outpost in the Democrats’ territory and lobbing grenade after grenade at Biden—often burning himself in the process.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, like a pinpoint laser beam, is focusing the impeachment inquiry narrowly on Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president and every time the media discusses the inquiry, Joe and Hunter Biden are likely to be invoked.

The media, rightfully so, will cover this conflict with new headlines every day provided that the Democratic House moves on with an impeachment inquiry and the president continues to toss those grenades without caution.

For Biden’s Democratic primary rivals, this story continues to bruise their main opponents—Trump and Biden. They will let this story drag on as long as possible in hopes of taking the Democratic frontrunner out of contention for the nomination while badly damaging Trump before the general election.

This story is enough to send Biden’s supporters to other Democratic candidates who may quickly become “more electable” as Biden dithers.

Trump’s strategy—to take Biden out—is working. Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic contenders also continue to chip away at Biden. But this race is far from over and if Biden can successfully answer Trump’s attacks while throwing a strong counterpunch, he can crowd out the other Democrats and make this effectively a two-person race.

Democratic primary voters consistently say they want a candidate who can take on Trump. This is Biden’s chance to take it to Trump and be the fighter he claims to be.

No single tweet, no statement, and no TV ad from Team Biden is going to put this to bed. Trump’s thirst for a fight will only become more emboldened with Biden’s silence. Biden must directly confront Trump if he hopes to win the nomination. Doing so will put every other Democratic contender in their shadows while he and Trump begin the inevitable slog to election day 2020.

Biden can make this a two-person race, the election he asked for during his kickoff speech in May, but he must shed his over-calculated caution, openly defend his name, his family, and his candidacy and repeatedly confront Trump head-on.

Until Biden opens Trump’s gift, the Trump fog machine will continue to choke him out and allow other candidates to vie for their own bare-knuckle fight with Trump."

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed legislation effectively banning the outsourcing of inmates to private contractors. The law will prohibit the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation from entering into or renewing contracts with private-prison corporations beginning in 2020 and bars the state from keeping prisoners in private lockups starting in 2028.

""These for-profit prisons do not reflect our values,"" Newsom said in a statement.

The Democratic governor promised to end the use of private prisons upon taking office in January. The state's prison system was already phasing them out, despite having to comply with an inmate population cap imposed by federal judges.

THE COLD HARD FACTS ABOUT AMERICA'S PRIVATE PRISON SYSTEM

California houses around 1,600 inmates in three prisons run by Florida-based GEO Group, according to the corrections department. Its contract expires in 2023, at which time it will not be able to renew it under the new law.

California ended its last out-of-state private prison contract over the summer when it moved its final 33 inmates from Arizona to an in-state facility. At one point, Californa had contracts with five other out-of-state prisons, The Sacramento Bee reported.

""By ending the use of for-profit, private prisons and detention facilities, we are sending a powerful message that we vehemently oppose the practice of profiteering off the backs of Californians in custody, that we will stand up for the health, safety and welfare of our people, and that we are committed to humane treatment for all,"" Assemblyman Rob Bonta, an Oakland Democrat and the bill's lead author, said in a statement.

The measure also bans privately-run immigration detention centers, which house illegal immigrants awaiting deportation hearings. Advocates and Democratic lawmakers have railed against using the facilities to hold immigrants, citing poor conditions.

ELIZABETH WARREN CALLS TO BAN PRIVATELY RUN FEDERAL PRISONS

A Homeland Security watchdog report found that immigrants were being crowded into cells and many had trouble accessing medical care, showers, clothes and mental health care.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) currently houses 4,000 illegal immigrants in four private detention facilities throughout the state. The largest facility, in Adelanto, has a temporary contract set to expire next year, along with another in Bakersfield.

""Within the next one to five years, private immigration detention will be abolished for good in California,"" said Christina Fialho, co-founder of Freedom for Immigrants.

An ICE spokesperson told Fox News the agency will most likely transfer detainees to ""a greater distance from their arrest location.""

""Thus, the only impact would be felt by the residents of California who would be forced to travel greater distances to visit friends and family in custody,"" the spokesperson said. ""The idea that a state law can bind the hands of a federal law enforcement agency managing a national network of detention facilities is wrong.""

Opponents of for-profit prison argue the model incentivizes mass incarceration. The industry has come under a microscope due to reports of poor living conditions and the alleged lack of inmate protections.

“These Wall Street-owned for-profit, private facilities inhumanely treat people as commodities. These companies are incentivized to maximize profits and minimize costs — including the important 'costs' of investments in programs, services and rehabilitation efforts that reduce recidivism rates and increase success for Californians upon their reentry into society,” said Assemblyman Bonta.

California became dependent on private prisons after a federal court ruled in 2009 that the state had to reduce its prison population to 137.5 percent of intended capacity, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The state has nearly 130,000 prison inmates, with another 82,220 in local jails. As of 2017, it spent $13.5 billion on correction expenditures annually, according to The Sentencing Project.

With the ban, California joins New York, Illinois and Iowa in implementing restrictions on private prisons.

“This won’t be decided by the debates. What I hear from folks time and time again is nothing meaningful came out of these debates and they’re often disconnected from peoples’ lives,” Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said Friday.

Bullock spoke with reporters from Fox News, NBC News, and NPR after headlining the ""Politics and Eggs"" speaking series, a must-stop for White House hopefuls in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire.

BULLOCK ACCUSES STEYER OF BUYING HIS WAY ONTO DEBATE STAGE

Bullock, who launched his campaign in the late spring, qualified for the second round of debates but didn’t reach the Democratic National Committee’s polling and fundraising criteria to make the cut for last month’s showdown or Tuesday’s debate, which will be held in Ohio.

The DNC’s raising the thresholds again for candidates to make the stage for November’s fifth round showdown, which will be held in Atlanta.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is in a similar situation. He jumped into the race relatively late and qualified for the first two rounds of debates, but didn’t make the stage last month and won’t be in the debate spotlight next week.

“I had to make a decision on the debate stage, whether I was going to keep laundering money through Facebook to try to stay on a debate stage that was pre-season football, that wasn’t going to make a difference in the standings, or whether I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Bennet explained in an interview on Tuesday with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com.

“I decided I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire at a time when they were going to start paying attention to this race,” he emphasized.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Twelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday’s showdown. Bullock, Bennet, and four other contenders in the still extremely large but shrinking field of Democratic White House hopefuls failed to make the cut.

Most of the lower-tier candidates have fired away for months at the DNC for their debate criteria, arguing it’s unfair and winnows the field of candidates before voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – the first four states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar, get to cast their ballots.

A slightly more diplomatic Bullock said on Thursday that “the DNC was well-intentioned but I don’t think the best example is for campaigns to be spending $50 or $60 to get each individual donor…. I don’t think that’s the best way to pick a candidate or nominee.”

Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chair Tom Perez told Fox News last month that the process has been “eminently fair” and added “we’re going “to continue to be transparent.”

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard - who failed to qualify for last month’s debate but made the stage for next week’s showdown - announced on Thursday that she may boycott next Tuesday’s debate.

GABBARD THREATENS TO BOYCOTT DEBATE TO PROTEST DNC

The congresswoman from Hawaii accused the DNC and its national media debate partners of “rigging” the primary battle against many of the lower-tier candidates and political outsiders running for the nomination.

“I am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media’s effort to rig 2020 primary,” she tweeted.

Even though he’s not making the stage, Bullock says he’s marching on. He told Fox News he has enough campaign cash to survive until the first votes in the early voting states in February.

“We’re still 120 days out from any voter expressing preference. I still think there’s a lot of time for this,” he stressed.

And Bennet took aim at the top-tier contenders for the nomination, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

“I think the support for the leaders in the race is very, very soft, maybe as soft as it’s ever been at this stage of the race,” he predicted."

City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a “no show” in the district.

“Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it’s going to be a moderate Democrat,” Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. “She’s a no-show in the district. She hasn’t brought about anything except division within the party.”

“Socialism doesn’t work,"" Cabrera added. ""I don’t want it for my children, for my grandchildren.""

He said he decided to run after becoming fed up with Ocasio-Cortez’s railing against Amazon’s plans to build a headquarters in Queens-- plans Amazon pulled out because of backlash from New York City lawmakers.

“It was staggering to me,” Cabrera said. “We have somebody who literally dismantled the possibility of us having 25,000 jobs, and she has yet to bring any jobs into the district.”

Cabrera could face attacks over his past views on gay rights. According to Politico, a video surfaced in 2014 of Cabrera praising Uganda’s restrictive anti-gay laws. In response, Cabrera, who is also a pastor, pointed out that he has voted in favor of every piece of legislation supported by the LGBT caucus while on New York's city council.

Cabrera was first elected to the city council in 2009, and he lives about a mile outside of the district which he is running to represent. Cabrera told City and State NY “I’ve done more for the Bronx and Queens than [Ocasio-Cortez] ever has.” Cabrera was a registered Republican until 2008.

A number of Republicans have entered the race to challenge Ocasio-Cortez, but Cabrera is the first well-known Democrat to do so.

Cabrera's complaints about Ocasio-Cortez echo those of Republican Scherie Murray, a businesswoman who emigrated from Jamaica and entered the race against Ocasio-Cortez in July.

""There is a crisis in Queens, and it’s called AOC,” Murray told Fox News at the time. “And instead of focusing on us, she’s focusing on being famous. Mainly rolling back progress and authoring the job-killing Green New Deal and killing the Amazon New York deal.”

Four other Republicans have filed to run for the seat as well-- former police officer John Cummings, medical journalist Ruth Papazian, construction contractor Miguel Hernandez and entrepreneur Antoine Tucker."

The 54-year-old, who won a bronze medal at London 2012, glued himself to the top of a British Airways Embraer 190 jet.

AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS HIT MAJOR CITIES IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, MORE THAN 300 ARRESTED

“Here I am on top of a f****** airplane at City Airport. I hate heights, I’m s******* myself, I managed to get on the roof. I am so shaky,” he said in a Facebook video.

“This is all about the climate and ecological crisis, we’re protesting against government inaction on climate and ecological breakdown. They declare a climate emergency and then do nothing about it.

“In fact they go the opposite direction, they sanction the expansion of airports, Heathrow, Bristol and others. We can’t let this go on, we can’t have our cake and eat it.”

He later noticed security were approaching and said, “Oh good security are coming. I hope they don’t take too long because this is f****** scary.”

He was eventually removed. A spokeswoman for British Airways said, “We are investigating what happened as a matter of urgency.” Meanwhile another protester managed to ground a flight from London City Airport to Dublin today — to the fury of the passengers on board. The Aer Lingus flight this morning was on the runway and about to take off when a smartly dressed man stood up and gave a lecture on climate change.

Filming himself on his phone, the man said, “I don’t wish to travel with you, but I don’t wish to get off. I’m extremely sorry for the inconvenience.”

Furious passengers responded saying, “You’re not sorry at all.” As their flight was held up, travelers pleaded with crew to remove the bespectacled man from the plane.

Continuing to address those on board, the man said, “We have two generations of human civilization left if we carry on doing what we are doing.”

Another passenger then asked him, “Why are you filming yourself?”

The man was later seen being led away from the aircraft by police officers. The flight, scheduled to depart at 9.40am, was delayed by 10 minutes.

Passenger Warren Swalbe tweeted, “Just about to take from London City airport. Our flight was infiltrated by a climate change protester.”

Nicholas Watt, the political editor of BBC Newsnight, wrote, “My flight from London City airport to Dublin has just been grounded by a climate change protester. On runway and about to take off when smartly dressed man in late middle age stood up with iPhone to deliver lecture on climate change up and down aisle.

“Cabin crew calmly and very politely asked protester to resume his seat. Politely but persistently he declined and proceeded to deliver his lecture on climate change in aisle. Plane was at the end of runway. So the pilot taxied back to gate where plane was met by throng of police. They came on board and escorted the protester off the plane.

“The final irony of the climate protest on our flight. We cannot take off until we have taken on extra fuel … to replace the fuel used up during the protest, our pilot notes with humor.”

Aer Lingus said the passenger was removed “due to disruptive behavior on board” and a full security check of the aircraft was completed before the plane departed.

The climate change group started their three-day “Hong Kong-style” shut down of London City Airport this morning, gluing themselves to the terminal building and dancing on a roof — but ultimately failing to cancel flights.

The latest protest is against the climate impact of flying and the government’s ongoing support of airport expansion. Hundreds of environmentalists attempted to block the entrance to the airport from the DLR by sitting together on the ground and singing “Fly today, gone tomorrow”.

Activist Phil Kingston, 83, was among those arrested — the third time he has been arrested as part of Extinction Rebellion protests in the past week.

Protesters were seen being dragged out the airport by officers after failing to break through security into the terminal. One was heard saying, “Please stop you’re hurting me.”

One activist climbed onto part of the roof of the terminal building where he was cheered by fellow protesters. Standing on the roof, he bellowed down, “Shut the airport down! Rebellion!”

He then danced on the roof as a live band played clarinet music below.

Those arriving for flights were redirected to a second terminal entrance by security workers and were not allowed to enter the building without showing their boarding cards first.

Taxi driver Jason Lempiere said that the protests had disrupted his work in and around the city. “It’s disturbing everyone’s everyday life — working, travel in and out of the airport. Yeah, have a voice, but not disrupt people’s lives like this,” he said.

The man who asked that question was Morgan Cox III, who sits on the Board of Directors for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). HRC is the organization that co-hosted CNN's ""LGBTQ Town Hall"" on Thursday and happens to be one of the nation's foremost advocacy groups on the issue. The event was closed to the public and only included invited guests, stakeholders in the movement, and members of “civic organizations,” according to the group.

Donor data also revealed that a man matching Cox's profile donated at least $5,400 to Warren in 2017 and 2018: A Morgan Cox III from Plano, Texas, gave $2,700 to Warren in July of 2017, $1,000 in April of 2018, and another $1,700 that same April.

When Cox was introduced on Thursday, CNN described him as someone tied to a ""real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas."" Both Cox's Linkedin profile and HRC's website say he's based in Plano, Texas. His Linkedin profile also notes that he works as a partner at Marquis Group, a real estate firm based in Texas.

ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS SHE WON'T HOLD 'BIG DOLLAR FUNDRAISERS' NO MATTER HOW MUCH TRUMP RAISES

Cox, on Thursday, prompted a catchy response from Warren after he asked her: ""Let's say you're on the campaign trail ... and a supporter approaches you and says, 'Senator, I am old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.' What is your response?""

""Well, I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that,"" Warren told Cox, drawing laughter from the audience. ""And I'm going to say, 'Then just marry one woman.'""

After more laughter and applause, Warren let loose an apparent jab at the hypothetical supporters. ""Assuming you can find one,"" she quipped, turning and rubbing her hands together.

Online, Warren experienced an outpouring of support. ""Elizabeth Warren had a perfect zinger at CNN’s LGBTQ town hall when asked about gay marriage,"" New York Magazine declared on Friday.

ELIZABETH WARREN FACES MOUNTING QUESTIONS ON ANOTHER PART OF HER PERSONAL STORY: WAS SHE FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT?

HRC is perhaps most well-known for its simple equality logo which features a yellow ""equals"" sign against a blue backdrop. Its mission statement reads: ""HRC strives to end discrimination against LGBTQ people and realize a world that achieves fundamental fairness and equality for all.""

The group has clashed with conservatives on issues surrounding religious liberty. It previously lambasted certain laws as ""cruel"" because they allowed religious adoption agencies to obtain exemptions from serving same-sex couples. In an op-ed from August of 2018, the organization's president compared Trump's Religious Liberty Task Force to oppressive tactics African-Americans faced during the Civil Rights era.

That task force was announced by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a way to protect people like the Colorado baker who was sued after refusing to serve a same-sex ceremony.

""The DOJ has a duty to uphold the rights of all Americans — not curtail them based on the extreme ideology of a few,"" HRC President Chad Griffin said.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., attempted to warn people about President Trump's political ads after showing that Facebook easily accepted false content intentionally submitted by her campaign.

The 2020 hopeful announced Saturday that her campaign submitted an ad that claimed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg endorsed Trump's re-election.

Facebook quickly approved the ad, showing, according to Warren, that the platform's new rules had turned the social media giant into a ""disinformation-for-profit machine.""

The ad itself eventually discloses that the Zuckerberg endorsement is false and quickly pivots to a warning about Trump. ""If Trump lies in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks,"" she said.

QUESTION THAT PROMPTED WARREN'S VIRAL ANSWER AT TOWN HALL MIGHT HAVE COME FROM SUPPORTIVE DONOR

""Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate,"" she said in another tweet. ""They’ve decided to let political figures lie to you—even about Facebook itself—while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies.""

She went on to claim that Trump's campaign spent $1 million per week on Facebook ads, allegedly including some that wouldn't air on television because they contained false claims.

""Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once through negligence. Now, they've changed their policy so they can profit from lies to the American people,"" she said before linking to a petition calling for Zuckerberg to be held ""accountable.""

In a statement provided to Fox News, Facebook defended its stance on not censoring political speech. “Facebook believes political speech should be protected. If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,"" a company spokesperson said.

'BLACK US VOTERS' MAIN TARGET OF RUSSIA'S 2016 DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN, SENATE REPORT CONCLUDES

Facebook also pointed to an FCC guideline requiring neutrality in hosting content.

The guideline reads: ""Except as other-wise indicated in § 73.1944, no station licensee is required to permit the use of its facilities by any legally qualified candidate for public office, but if any licensee shall permit any such candidate to use its facilities, it shall afford equal opportunities to all other candidates for that office to use such facilities. Such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast by any such candidate.""

The company previously rejected former Vice President Joe Biden's request to take down a critical ad from the Trump campaign. According to The New York Times, the company defended its decision in a letter to Biden's campaign. Warren's tweet appeared to refer to that particular ad, which both CNN and NBC refused to air.

“Our approach is grounded in Facebook’s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,"" wrote Katie Harbath, the company's head of global elections policy.

Warren's stunt came as Facebook faced criticism from conservatives and progressives alike. Conservatives have long railed against social media platforms for apparently showing greater scrutiny over their content and unnecessarily censoring certain information.

Progressives, like Warren, have warned that Facebook could easily be leveraged to help Republicans win re-election. A long-running argument by Democrats is that Russia used Facebook to help Trump win the 2016 election.

Warren, in particular, has taken aim at the social media giant, vowing to break up the company and combat its allegedly anti-competitive practices.

Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, blasted the Democrat's ad as a ""political stunt"" and said it ""won't distract from Warren's primary goal: giving government the control of your health care and hiking everyone's taxes to pay for it."""

“Is it getting hot in here, or just the elevating public consciousness around rampant wealth inequality?” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked via Twitter earlier this year. According to AOC’s House website, she contends that income inequality is “being used by those in power to amplify fear and anger in our communities and further divide us.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren concurs.

WEALTH INEQUALITY IN US REACHED HIGHEST LEVEL IN OVER 50 YEARS, CENSUS SAYS

“When you’ve got a government, when you’ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn’t doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple,” the Massachusetts Democrat says.

AOC and Warren are right, to a point: Income inequality, indeed, has grown on President Trump’s watch. And the numbers back them up.

The key metric here is called the Gini coefficient. A 0.00 score represents perfect income equality; neither rich nor poor exist, since everyone has identical incomes. A 1.00 Gini coefficient represents perfect income inequality: The rich earn all the money, and nobody else makes a penny.

Under President Trump, America’s Gini coefficient ticked up, according to the latest data, from 0.48 in 2017 to 0.49 in 2018.

On Friday night's show he seemed to view radio jock Howard Stern as a kindred spirit.

""That's why you and I are the last sane people because we're liberals but we don't go for all the bulls--- on the far left."" — Bill Maher to Howard Stern

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

Maher also took aim at Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the foreign-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested this week on campaign finance charges before allegedly attempting to flee the U.S.

""This is the great irony of the Trump presidency,"" Maher said. ""Foreign criminals must be kept out of the country at all costs, unless they're here to steal our elections.""

On the Trump impeachment inquiry, and Republicans' reluctance to cooperate with Democrat-led House committees, Maher quipped: ""The president of the United States is going to be impeached because he treats subpoenas like parking tickets.""

Maher also made the case that Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were too ""far left"" to win the general election, and touted Sen. Amy Klobuchar as a ""dark horse"" who could potentially top the party's ticket.

Maher spoke to Klobuchar in a one-on-one interview. He argued that Klobuchar was ""plenty liberal"" but could actually beat President Trump.

""Obviously this is a fight between two wings of the party, which is almost every election. There is a center in the Democrat, a center-left wing. You're plenty liberal. You're plenty progressive,"" Maher told Klobuchar. ""And then there is a far-left which I think would be represented by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.""

Klobuchar would not address Warren and Sanders directly but clearly dismissed their platforms and pushed her center-left agenda.

""I want to win big and if someone is looking to kick one hundred forty nine million Americans off their current health insurance in four years then I'm not your candidate,"" Klobuchar said. ""If you want to use a bunch of hardworking people's money to send rich people's kids to college for free and I'm not your candidate. And just because people say ideas are bold doesn't mean they're bold. They may be bad.""

Maher also slammed former Vice President Joe Biden, saying he may be too old for the presidency, and that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., wasn't doing well in the polls -- despite the media attention she's received after debate performances.

Klobuchar ripped Trump on his Ukraine phone call before making a case for her candidacy, saying ""she could bring in moderate Republicans"" and ""win big."" She is currently polling at 2 percent in the latest national Fox News Poll.

In an awkward moment, Maher emphasized that Klobuchar being a woman might help her chances as well.

""I'm saying it's a lot easier to be on the center side of things, as Obama was, if you are not a white man,"" Maher tried to clarify. ""If you're a white straight man.""

Trump Jr. shot back with a comment on her poll numbers. ""Based on your tanking poll numbers, what’s definitely a joke is your entire campaign Yikes!"" he tweeted.

Harris saw a bump in polling over the summer after she took Biden to task over his controversial comments about race. But since then, she's seen drops in multiple polls,

Harris recently faced criticism for calling on Twitter to suspend President Trump's account. The senator sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, accusing the president of violating the company's terms of service.

""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account,"" she said. ""When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing."""

NANCY PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S RALLY COMMENTS ABOUT BIDEN 'BEYOND THE PALE,' RIPS SENATE REPUBLICANS' 'COWARDICE' ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The question of recusal was raised by Rep. Thomas Masie, R-Ky., who asked if senators running for president “have a conflict of interest regarding possible impeachment of an opponent.”

House Democrats last month launched an impeachment inquiry into the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats allege that Trump was using U.S. military aid to push Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s conduct in the country. Trump has said there was no quid pro quo and that he wanted only to root out corruption.

But as the inquiry consumes Washington and the 2020 campaign trail, it is possible the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach the president in the coming months.

That would then set up an impeachment trial in the Senate, where a host of 2020 candidates -- including Sens. Klobuchar; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Michael Bennet, D-Colo.

It raises the question of whether they would benefit if their potential 2020 general election rival were removed from office -- and if so, if they should therefore recuse themselves from any trial.

“Shouldn’t they recuse themselves if it came to the Senate?” Massie asked. “Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law?”

Booker was asked on Friday if he would ever recuse himself, and he gave a short, simple answer: “No.”

In her answer, Klobuchar went into greater detail.

“I was elected as a U.S. senator for the state of Minnesota and my job will be to be a juror in the case and...I very strongly believe that this impeachment proceeding must go forward,” she said. “I don't know what counts that the House will come up with and what they will bring over to us but my job will be to look at the evidence and make a decision.”

Other senators have not addressed the question directly, but have no given any sign that they would recuse themselves. On Wednesday, Harris sent a letter with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to every Trump cabinet official demanding they cooperate with ongoing investigations and preserve relevent evidence."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has moved from the loony left to “The Twilight Zone” with her latest nutty plan to achieve her impossible dream of turning America into a socialist utopia.

In reality, the congresswoman’s plan would bring about a national nightmare – not just for all of us alive today, but for future generations – because it would destroy the U.S. economy. Building it back up would take a very long time.

Ocasio-Cortez labels her absurd plan A Just Society. If you regret not being born early enough to enjoy the fun times of the Great Depression, or want to live in a “workers’ paradise” like North Korea, Venezuela or Cuba, you’ll love Comrade AOC’s plan.

AOC GETS CHOKED UP AT CLIMATE FORUM: 'MY DREAMS OF MOTHERHOOD ARE NOW BITTERSWEET'

Incredibly, this cockeyed plan has been praised by one of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination – Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

“It's going to take big, structural change to tackle poverty and inequality in the U.S., and @AOC's ‘A Just Society’ is just the type of bold, comprehensive thinking we'll need to get it done,” Warren recently tweeted.

Like her Green New Deal and other wacko plans, Ocasio-Cortez’s latest attempt to fundamentally transform the United States into a bastion of Marxism would end up erasing the tremendous economic growth Americans have experienced not just under the Trump administration, but throughout American history.

Ocasio-Cortez says her legislation, which is composed of several different bills, would “combat one of the greatest threats to our country, our democracy, and our freedom: economic inequality.”

There aren’t enough rich people to pay for AOC’s grandiose plans, even if government confiscated all their money and left them penniless and homeless.

That’s right, folks, you can forget about terrorism, trade wars, America’s $22 trillion debt, skyrocketing health insurance costs and every other significant problem facing the country. Apparently, the real threat to Americans’ health and welfare is that Amazon head Jeff Bezos has too many billions of dollars in investments and Bill Gates – the world’s most generous philanthropist – owns too many houses.

The Just Society plan would solve America’s alleged wealth gap “problem” by – surprise – dramatically expanding the power of the federal government and its welfare programs and running up tens of trillions of dollars in new debt in the process.

There aren’t enough rich people to pay for AOC’s grandiose plans, even if government confiscated all their money and left them penniless and homeless. Like a credit card bill that keeps growing, at some point Ocasio-Cortez’s trillions of dollars in massive new spending would have to be paid for – meaning gigantic tax increases for all of us, our children, grandchildren and beyond.

The most important part of the Just Society proposal is that it would substantially expand the meaning of “poverty” so that potentially tens of millions of additional Americans would be considered legally impoverished and made newly eligible for numerous welfare programs. These include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly referred to as food stamps.

You know the old saying that there’s no such thing as a free lunch? Comrade AOC would hand out free breakfasts, lunches and dinners, among many other free benefits. Perhaps the Tooth Fairy, little elves living in trees, or space aliens landing in Area 51 would foot the bill.

Ocasio-Cortez’s Recognizing Poverty Act would direct “the Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Bureau of Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics, to adjust the federal poverty line to account for geographic cost variation, costs related to health insurance, work expenses for the family, child care needs, and new necessities, like internet access.”

As Matt Weidinger of the American Enterprise Institute notes, a 2018 report found that if the standard used in Ocasio-Cortez’s legislation were applied to the residents of New York City, roughly 40 percent of all households would be considered impoverished, compared to only 14 percent under the current standards.

Altering the poverty line in accordance with Comrade AOC’s legislation would also push tens of millions of people onto the Children’s Health Insurance Program and Medicaid, among other programs.

In some cases, people would effectively have no choice but to be forced onto the government dole. For example, many of the families now receiving health insurance subsidies to purchase insurance plans in ObamaCare exchanges would suddenly become eligible for Medicaid and would no longer be able to have access to those subsidies. This would require them to choose between enrolling in Medicaid or paying the much higher, non-subsidy ObamaCare price for private insurance.

There are already more than 72 million people enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The Just Society plan would increase those numbers dramatically.

But that’s just the beginning. The Just Society proposal would also prevent government agents from denying convicted criminals access to federal welfare, health, disability, education, and other government social and welfare benefits on the basis of their conviction – regardless of how serious the offense was.

The same would be true for immigrants who are residing in the United States illegally. Under Ocasio-Cortez’s plan, immigration status cannot prevent welfare eligibility, giving millions of people now here in violation of federal law access to taxpayer-funded public benefits.

This one provision alone could destroy the American economy, because it would likely encourage millions of people from around the world to come to the United States to receive free services we have no way of paying for.

And, of course, Ocasio-Cortez doesn’t believe in immigration restrictions. Imagine tripling, quadrupling or further increasing the U.S. population with people from around the world looking for “free stuff.” How could the rest of us support them all?

Does forcing Americans to pay for food stamps and health care for non-Americans and college education for violent offenders sound “just” and “fair” to you?

The Just Society would also enact strict housing price controls on landlords, lowering the incentives for developers to construct new housing projects.

The U.S. economy is better now than at any time in recent memory. Unemployment is low for virtually every demographic, the stock market continues to remain at near-historic highs, and there are more than 7 million job openings.

I guess all that is considered “unjust” by Comrade AOC. Under her grand plan we’d all be equally impoverished, equally overtaxed, equally dependent on government assistance, and equally suffering in a socialist hell.

The Just Society is anything but. It should be rejected by every American with even an elementary school-level knowledge of how our economy works.

Lots of major news organizations made the claim, interviewing supposed insiders – from CNN to The New Yorker and The Nation.

New Yorker Editor David Remnick rationalized the pushback against Trump in 2017: “The problem in Washington is not a Deep State; the problem is a shallow man – an untruthful, vain, vindictive, alarmingly erratic President.”

NEW BOOK CLAIMS ROD ROSENSTEIN THOUGHT JOHN KELLY AND JEFF SESSIONS WOULD BACK USE OF 25TH AMENDMENT AGAINST TRUMP

Now there’s no attempt at hiding it. In one of the more blatant impeachment stories of the week, New York Times columnist James B. Stewart went on NBC’s “Today” show to tell everyone that Trump is right. Stewart was pushing a new book, “Deep State,” only he sees the Deep Staters as heroes – the same way the rest of his media buddies do.

Co-host Savannah Guthrie tossed him a softball question, clearly amazed that Trump would call out the government employees who are trying to sabotage his administration.

“And his central allegation is that there are people inside these government agencies actively working against him,” Guthrie said to Stewart. “What did you find?” (Watch the video. Guthrie’s hand movements and inflection are a great example of how journalists manipulate a news story in ways that are hard to tell from transcripts.)

Guthrie got the answer Trump supporters already knew: Trump was right, but Stewart gave his own personal spin so viewers knew the good guys.

“Well, you meet these characters in my book, and the fact is, in a sense, he’s right,” Stewart said, referring to the president. “There is a Deep State, there is a bureaucracy in our country who has pledged to respect the Constitution, respect the rule of law.”

That’s pretty clear, despite Stewart’s attempt at making the Deep Staters seem honorable. “What Trump calls the Deep State in the United States is protecting the American people and protecting the Constitution. It’s a positive thing in this sense,” he added.

Only leftists see a government employee working to overturn the result of a legal election as “positive.”

For those of you following at home, that’s another media narrative destroyed. Bury it next to the Russia collusion hoax.

Of course there’s a Deep State. Americans know this, which is why they should doubt the “whistleblower” who didn’t even have firsthand information.

The biggest proponents of impeachment outside the Deep State are what we should probably call the Shallow Media. Take NBC’s histrionic Political Director Chuck Todd. Recently he was screaming that “A National Nightmare Is Upon Us!” (One other than watching NBC.) Now he’s upset about Americans having “two sets of realities.”

What he was really saying is a bunch of Americans dare to think for themselves and realize that Todd has lost any sense of neutrality.

Only leftists see a government employee working to overturn the result of a legal election as “positive.”

“There is a 40 percent of the country that is only getting fed one reality; arguably, 60 percent are getting what I would argue is reality,” Todd said.

Hubris is a symptom of bad journalism.

The same attitude was evident in a graphic used on-screen during “CNN Newsroom.” It said: “WH Declares War on Impeachment Inquiry & Constitution.” Media bias? At CNN? Never! It’s one thing to declare war on a bogus impeachment. It’s another thing to declare war on the Constitution.

But media outlets were more than willing to go all Schiff-ty and simply make things up.

In a memorable exchange, Trump tweeted how former President Barack Obama had said “he did not have the right to sign DACA” and did it anyway. Within minutes, the crafty folks at PolitiFact rated that “Mostly False.” But five minutes later, Washington Post White House reporter Seung Min Kim pointed out that PolitiFact was, in fact, wrong.

Then there’s one of my favorites: bias by omission. It’s not just the stupid and one-sided comments journalists make, it’s what they leave out.

For example, there’s the media fascination with former Secretary of State Colin Powell whining about “his party.” The problem is, NBC, MSNBC and CNN claimed “his party” was the Republicans, even though he’s endorsed Democrats for president three times in a row. He hasn’t backed a Republican for president since the 2004 election.

Pretty soon, they’ll be calling far-left Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a Republican because she was one until 20 years ago. (Yes, she really was.)

New allegations against Matt Lauer

The Matt Lauer disaster continues to shock even the most cynical media watchers. Investigative reporter Ronan Farrow’s new book “Catch and Kill” includes allegations that the former NBC “Today” host raped another NBC employee in a hotel room during the 2014 Olympics.

Farrow also slammed the network for blocking his investigation into movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. He eventually took his story to The New Yorker. Farrow alleged that Weinstein had tried to blackmail the network to make the story go away, claiming Weinstein “was aware of Lauer’s behavior and capable of revealing it.”

NBC cited the book in a story, saying it had reportedly “reached nondisclosure agreements with at least seven women who alleged harassment or discrimination at the company, including former employees with complaints about former ‘Today’ host Matt Lauer.”

Lauer denied the alleged rape but said he engaged in an “extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter.”

Facebook defends free speech

Social media companies are caught between a rock and a hard place. They hit the scene as free-speech venues and have gradually restricted speech more and more. Now Facebook has taken a positive step in support of free speech and many in the media don’t like it.

The Trump campaign created an ad about former Vice President Joe Biden’s involvement in Ukraine. The reaction was swift. CNN refused to run the ad and NBCUniversal (the folks dealing with the Lauer rape allegations) wouldn’t run it either.

Team Biden demanded Facebook take it down as well. But the company refused, arguing it doesn’t fact-check political speech.

The left and media were infuriated. The Washington Post headline showed the media mindset: “CNN won’t run two Trump campaign ads, citing ‘demonstrably false’ claims.” Facebook was supposed to follow CNN’s lead and didn’t.

Sen. Warren took out an ad showing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shaking hands with Trump and pretending “Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election.” She admitted it wasn’t true, but remained furious that Facebook wouldn’t play the role of referee so her campaign could try to ban Trump ads.

It might not seem like a big deal, but Facebook is facing constant calls to regulate speech. It’s nice to see the social media giant go all Nancy Reagan and “just say no!”

I think Nate Silver makes a good point when he says that there are some candidates in the contest for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination who are doing better than expectations but only Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are actually doing well. They’re really the only ones who can be satisfied that they’re meeting their own expectations for progress. We’re almost to the point that we can begin to think of this as a two-person race.

In looking at national polls pre- and post-September 23 (the date Silver uses as the beginning of the impeachment process), there are a few interesting observations we can make. The first is that Biden is actually slightly up despite having his name dragged through the mud. It would probably be fairer to say that he’s holding steady, but there’s no sign in erosion. This appears to be the case for most of the candidates, too, as the majority of them, like Biden, are up or down less than a point.

But that doesn’t mean the polls have been static. Elizabeth Warren has gained a substantial 5.7 percent and is now nearing parity with Biden. Almost all of her gains appear to have come from Kamala Harris (down 2.6 percent), Cory Booker (down 1.3 percent) and Bernie Sanders (down 1.1 percent).

Sanders is actually weathering the fallout from his heart attack surprisingly well, but his campaign has been losing slow and steady ground to Warren for a couple of months now. He’s now looking like a second tier candidate, albeit the only second tier candidate in the race. The real news here is that Kamala Harris has fallen to 4.7 percent in the national polls. This appears to be fatal to her campaign hopes, as she really need to move upward into the teens to sustain a serious operation.

I suspect Harris doesn’t have much time to right her ship, but there is one small hopeful sign. She’s seems to have lost the battle with Warren for voters who were undecided between the two of them, but she’s also the logical landing point for these voters if Warren’s campaign badly falters in the coming months. I think her model was more reliant on Biden faltering so she could pick up some fleeing moderates, but at this point I think she’d need both Warren and Biden to collapse to get back into contention.

National polls only tell part of the story, of course. In Iowa, Warren has led in two of three recent polls and Sanders remains very much in the running. In New Hampshire, Warren had led in all three of the most recent polls and Sanders has slipped into a distant third place. Yet, Biden enjoys a narrow lead in Nevada (where Bernie Sanders looks competitive) and a massive lead in South Carolina.

Since there’s an advantage to winning the earliest contests, I think Warren looks like she’s in the best position right now. But she doesn’t have Iowa locked down by an means (RCP Avg. Warren 22.7, Biden 19.3, Sanders 16.0).

For both Biden and Sanders, it would be a very bad development if Warren were to win Iowa because it would probably solidify her advantage in New Hampshire and give her a sweep of the first two contests. Sanders would be effectively knocked out, I think, because it will kill his chances in Nevada and any chance of coming in second place in South Carolina. Biden is in a better position to recover from losing the first two (or even three) battles because of his strong lead in South Carolina. If he were to lose in Iowa and New Hampshire (and perhaps Nevada as well), I’m not sure that his lead in the Palmetto State would hold up, and it certainly would narrow.

While Sanders probably needs to win Iowa in order to survive, Biden would be in a decent position losing there provided that the winner were anybody other than Warren.

I suppose there is still plenty of time for the top three candidates to stumble or for a lower tier candidate to catch fire, but the eventual dynamics of the race seems to be coming into view. Iowa looks huge. As I wrote back on September 19, Kamala Harris has put all her chips on Iowa, so it will be decisive for her campaign. That appears to be the case for Sanders, too. Warren will be sitting pretty if she wins the Hawkeye State but in much more of a dogfight if she does not. And Biden really needs to avoid an outcome where Warren carries the first two states.

This is a very stupid way to decide a nomination. I’ve written that the Iowa caucuses are a fraud and should be doomed. It’s a subject that I will no doubt return to many times before Iowan Democrats turn out in the cold next winter to decide the fate of the country.

For now, I’ll just remind you of what happened in Iowa in 2012.

…an initial and preliminary count of the votes indicated that Mitt Romney had won the caucuses by eight votes. And that is how the media reported it. Yes, Rick Santorum had come out of nowhere to finish a shockingly strong second place, but he hadn’t won anything. Romney, who had suffered the indignity of lagging behind in the polls (at one time or another) to everyone in the race except Santorum, had managed to right his ship and avoid a bad stumble out of the gate. This was hugely helpful to him as the contest moved to Romney’s home turf in New Hampshire. Remember, not only had he served as governor in neighboring Massachusetts, but he owned a home in New Hampshire. Two weeks later, however, and after Romney romped to victory in the Granite State, the Iowa Republican Party had to make two embarrassing announcements. The first was that they had finalized counting the votes and that it turned out that Rick Santorum didn’t have an eight vote deficit but instead a 34-vote lead. The second announcement was that it was impossible to actually declare a winner [because results from eight of 1,774 precincts could not be located for certification] …In 2012, Iowa had 28 delegates at the convention, and according to the New York Times, Ron Paul got 22 of them, Romney got five, and Rick Santorum got zero. One vote is listed as undetermined but probably went for Romney… …you can justifiably say that Santorum won Iowa because he had the most votes in the certified count, or that Romney won because he benefited the most from the result, or that Ron Paul won because he actually got almost all the delegates, or that no one won because the party refused to declare a winner.

The Democratic caucuses operate with slightly different rules in Iowa, but it remains a beauty contest where the delegates are not decided or committed to any candidate regardless of results. It literally does not matter who wins in determining how the delegates will be awarded. Yet, the perception that someone won has a gigantic impact on the media coverage, and next year this looks to be truer and more consequential than ever."

* As expected, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) came out on top in the first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, but his 47% wasn’t enough to prevent a runoff. The incumbent will face millionaire novice Eddie Rispone (R), who received 27% support in the multi-candidate contest.

* Donald Trump, who headlined a rally in Louisiana late last week, said he pushed John Bel Edwards’ support from 66% to 47%. There is literally no evidence to support this – pre-election polls were surprisingly accurate – and the president has an unfortunate habit of touting made-up numbers.

* After Facebook refused to take down a Trump campaign ad with demonstrably false claims, Elizabeth Warren launched an ad of her own with deliberately false information – about Facebook.

* On a related note, the social-media giant responded by noting that broadcast stations have aired the same dishonest Trump ad. It opens an interesting door: broadcast stations are regulated by the FCC, while Facebook isn’t regulated by government agency.

* Beto O’Rourke’s campaign announced on Friday afternoon that it raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, which is an improvement on the second quarter. That said, nearly all of the top Democratic contenders had better July-to-September hauls.

* On a related note, O’Rourke said at CNN’s LGBTQ town-hall event last week that he believes houses of worship should probably lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose marriage equality. That’s almost certainly not a legally sound approach.

* Bernie Sanders noted in an ABC News interview, which aired yesterday, that there’s an important difference between his vision and Elizabeth Warren’s. “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones,” the Vermont independent said. “I’m not.”

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS’ PLAN: ECONOMISTS

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ""I am a capitalist to my bones.""

Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ""will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

A Gallup poll this year found that 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, while 51 percent say it would be a bad thing. Gallup noted that in 1942, a Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing while only 25 percent called it a good thing.

The polling is fresh evidence that attitudes toward socialism are changing, amid the popularity in the Democratic Party of Democratic socialists like Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pushes policies like “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal.

Meanwhile, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, claim that billionaires could face a 97.5 percent average effective tax rate under Sanders' plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020.

Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told Bloomberg that “with the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes."" The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan.

The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent for fortunes in excess of $10 billion.

Sanders vowed to go further than Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires’ fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren.

Sanders’ plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders’ tax rates don’t top out until 8 percent for the richest households.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., actually defeat President Trump in the 2020 presidential election? Democrats watching Trump’s Minneapolis rally Thursday night have to wonder.

President Trump wowed the crowd in blue-state Minnesota. And what a crowd it was; tens of thousands inside the arena chanting and cheering, while hundreds more stood outside hoping to get in. The energy in the room was extraordinary, especially considering that the president, buoyed by his fans, spoke for an exhausting hour and 45 minutes.

Forget the polls, forget the partisan impeachment inquiry; the enthusiasm of those Minnesota supporters reminds us how powerful Trump is on the campaign trail and how lackluster Democratic candidates look in comparison.

TRUMP BELITTLES BIDENS WITH GRAPHIC LANGUAGE AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY, AS CHAOS UNFOLDS OUTSIDE ARENA

Could Biden rouse such a crowd? Warren?

Trump’s enduring popularity with Republicans reminds us, too, that GOP senators would be committing political suicide if they voted to toss the president from office in an impeachment trial. They won’t do it.

How does President Trump excite his supporters? It’s his authenticity. Democrats will mock that claim. They protest that Trump lies and exaggerates; they fact-check his speeches and burrow in on discrepancies, but they miss the big picture.

President Trump famously goes “off-script” at such gatherings, and sometimes the results are painful. Saying Biden “kissed Obama’s ass” was vulgar; Trump should not have gone there.

Hating Donald Trump is not a compelling platform.

But sometimes, Trump’s best moments are when he recounts scenes he has experienced as president, like witnessing the coffins of fallen soldiers come off a plane from some hostile land. He recalls the anguish of the families who just minutes before were “fine,” but who are then devastated by that tragic sight. There is no doubt that Trump, too, is crushed by the loss of another fine young American.

There is also no doubt that those scenes have prompted Trump’s much-criticized decision to pull out of Syria. The entire foreign policy establishment has declared his move reckless; he has been denounced for “betraying” the Kurds by friends and foes alike.

But, as with so many issues where Trump has upset the established order, there is a kernel of common sense behind the president’s move.

Americans do not want to be the lone policeman in the Middle East. We expect our European allies, in particular, to also step up. Their refusal to take any responsibility for dealing with ISIS prisoners, for instance, is unacceptable; they, too, have been attacked by terrorists.

From the day he took office, President Trump told the State Department and the Pentagon he wanted to bring our troops home. Both those agencies are accustomed to operating as they choose; they did not take his demands seriously and failed to produce a plan to fulfill that campaign promise.

This is what drives his enemies crazy and his fans to love him more. The president, I am told, keeps a chart on a wall outside his office listing the promises he made to voters. Some are checked off – like reducing taxes, moving our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and exiting the Paris Climate Accords. Some remain undone. Those remaining pledges drive his policymaking.

Which president has ever done such a thing? None that I know of.

In Minneapolis, Trump talked up his administration’s job creation and strong economy – a powerful message backed up by another spike in consumer sentiment – and also took potshots at rival Biden.

A local ABC affiliate covering the speech reported: “Trump has been spreading groundless claims that the Bidens used their family name to get China and Ukraine to pay them millions of dollars.”

Are those claims “groundless?” Not really. Who doubts that Hunter Biden cashed in on his father’s prominence as vice president and as point person for the Obama administration in Ukraine and China? Hunter traveled with his father on Air Force Two to China and within a matter of weeks Hunter’s barely-there firm Rosemont Seneca entered into a new partnership with state-owned Bank of China and went on to raise $1.5 billion.

Trump rightly told the Minnesota crowd that the Chinese are tough negotiators and do not part with their money easily.

There may have been no legal lines crossed by the Bidens, but Hunter’s business dealings and Joe’s tolerance of them do not appear ethical.

Similarly, the president may not have broken the law when he asked Ukraine’s president to investigate the former vice president and his son, but his now-notorious phone call appears underhanded. Does it rise to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors?” Democrats must think so. They apparently believe that impeaching President Trump will help them win in 2020.

Democrats are encouraged by polling that shows most Americans open to the impeachment inquiry. That’s because our country is fair-minded and considers no one above the law.

On the other hand, Americans expect such a serious task as an impeachment inquiry to be done openly and in a nonpartisan manner. That is not what is taking place.

In putting Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in charge of the probe, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., eliminated any possibility that Trump supporters would view the proceedings as above-board.

Schiff is reviled by many for having spun endless false charges that the president colluded with Russia, lying repeatedly that he had conclusive “proof.”

Now it turns out that Schiff lied again, denying that his office had met with the whistleblower, shredding Americans’ confidence in the proceedings. At the same time, he is holding closed-door interviews and testimony, all seemingly designed to keep the public from knowing what Trump did or did not do.

Recent polling shows little increase in support for impeachment since the investigation got underway.

My guess: enthusiasm for the proceedings will wane further as voters become disgusted with how Schiff is managing the investigation, and as no new charges result from the endless interviews and subpoenas.

What will Democrats run on then? They have not passed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, or an immigration compromise, or an infrastructure bill, nor have they done anything serious about prescription drug prices.

In part of a plan to reign in ""corporate greed"" released by his campaign Monday, Sanders would create a new agency within the Department of Commerce called the ""Bureau of Corporate Governance."" It would issue charters to large companies requiring them to base their actions on more than just the interest of shareholders. The plan would apply to corporations with more than $100 million in annual revenue or balance sheet total and to all publicly traded companies.

That is a significantly lower threshold than the $1 billion bar for annual revenue Warren pushed earlier this year in a proposal that called for a similar bureau to be created called the ""Office of United States Corporations.""

""This new federal charter will require corporate boards to consider the interests of all of the stakeholders in a company,"" the post on Sanders' campaign website says, ""including workers, customers, shareholders, and the communities in which the corporation operates.""

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS 'CAPITALIST'

Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, has long railed against big business and capitalism in general, and his newest proposal seeks to use the government to mandate that companies take into account how their behavior affects ""society at large.""

In another attempted one-up of Warren, Sanders' plan would require public companies and corporations with more than $100 million in annual revenue or balance sheet total to have employees elect 45 percent of their boards of directors. A Warren plan would require just 40 percent of such boards to be elected by employees and would apply to companies with $1 billion or more in yearly revenue.

During a Sunday interview with ABC's ""This Week"", Sanders slammed Warren for previously saying she is a ""capitalist through her bones.""

""I'm not,"" he told interviewer Jonathan Karl.

ANA NAVARRO TELLS RAND PAUL NOT TO 'MANSPLAIN' IN DISCUSSION OF MADURO AND SOCIALISM

Sanders has battled with Warren for room in the progressive lane of the 2020 Democratic primary, with both seeking to provide a liberal alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden pitched himself to voters as a moderate compared to the rest of the Democratic field but could be a more vulnerable frontrunner than at any point in the campaign as he's been wrapped up in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

A Fox News survey released last week found Warren is beating Sanders by five points while Biden -- with 32 percent -- holds a significant 10-point lead over Warren.

After a heart attack earlier this month, Sanders will strive for a successful debate Tuesday, which could mollify some Democrats' fears about the 78-year-old's health.

""This year, the Business Roundtable released empty words recognizing the error in admitting corporations put profits and shareholder returns above everything else. Empty words are not enough,"" Sanders' website says in what could be a preview of his rhetoric Tuesday night. ""This plan will ensure that corporations conduct business in a fair way – a way that treats workers and the communities in which businesses operate with respect.""

Sanders' Monday post includes a long list of other progressive proposals, including reversing the Trump tax cut for corporations, a ban on noncompetes and forced arbitration, a provision giving the FTC unilateral authority to stop mergers without going to court and a requirement that large companies eventually become at least 20 percent employee-owned."

Bernie Sanders’ plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020.

Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told Bloomberg that “with the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes."" The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan.

The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent for fortunes in excess of $10 billion.

Sanders vowed to go further than Sen. Elizabeth Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires’ fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren.

Sanders’ plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders’ tax rates don’t top out until 8 percent for the richest households.

BIDENS ACKNOWLEDGE ETHICS WOES

NYT: “Hunter Biden, whose overseas business dealings have drawn relentless attacks from President Trump and posed a threat to the candidacy of his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month, his lawyer said on Sunday, a move his father later lauded in a forceful defense of his son’s integrity. The lawyer also said in a statement that if Mr. Biden were to be elected president, his son would ‘agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.’ The decision is the first action the pro-Biden camp has taken that appears to acknowledge the extent to which Hunter Biden’s business practices have created an untenable problem for his father’s 2020 campaign. With the fourth Democratic primary debate only two days away … Mr. Biden’s lower-polling Democratic rivals have suggested his son’s work overseas raises questions about conflict of interest.”



Rolls out ethics, campaign finance plan in reply - Reuters: “Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden would look to ban private money from federal elections, his campaign said on Monday in a plan for government ethics that doubled as an attack on President Donald Trump. … The former U.S. vice president is promising to match individual donations for elections with government funding, and to block cash from private sources. Biden would also establish a new commission to enforce anti-corruption laws, bar lobbying by foreign governments and require candidates to disclose their tax returns.”



Dems still hedging on Warren - NYT: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience [in Washington] one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren’s guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch… Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case… But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three. … [H]er growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them.”



Trump said to still want Warren - Axios: “President Trump's allies still fear a general election matchup against a banged-up Joe Biden more than a run against an invigorated Elizabeth Warren, people close to the president tell Axios. Warren has surpassed Biden in some primary polls, seemingly helped by the early coverage of Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate conspiracy theories involving Biden and his son Hunter. And a Fox News poll now shows Biden and Warren each would lead Trump, 50% to 40%. … Several advisers in Trumpworld told [Axios] that Warren is arguably a better candidate in terms of being quick on her feet and prepared on a debate stage. But those advisers say her liberal stances on some issues and her ‘likeability’ problem with segments of general election voters make her weaker against Trump than even a Biden hindered by gaffes, generational dissonances and a son with personal drama and a lobbying record.”



Sanders slams Warren as ‘capitalist’ - Fox News: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders … is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a ‘capitalist.’ ‘There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,’ Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s ‘This Week.’ ‘Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.’ The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ‘I am a capitalist to my bones.’ Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ‘will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.’”

History: “[On this day 72 years ago] U.S. Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager becomes the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. Yeager, born in Myra, West Virginia, in 1923, was a combat fighter during World War II and flew 64 missions over Europe. He shot down 13 German planes and was himself shot down over France, but he escaped capture with the assistance of the French Underground. After the war, he was among several volunteers chosen to test-fly the experimental X-1 rocket plane, built by the Bell Aircraft Company to explore the possibility of supersonic flight. … Yeager flew the X-1 over Rogers Dry Lake in Southern California. The X-1 was lifted to an altitude of 25,000 feet by a B-29 aircraft and then released through the bomb bay, rocketing to 40,000 feet and exceeding 662 miles per hour (the sound barrier at that altitude). The rocket plane, nicknamed ‘Glamorous Glennis,’ was designed with thin, unswept wings and a streamlined fuselage modeled after a .50-caliber bullet.”

AMBASSADOR LAYS UKRAINE CLAIMS OFF ON TRUMP

AP: “A U.S. ambassador is expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what President Donald Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony in the impeachment probe. Gordon Sondland, Trump’s hand-picked ambassador to the European Union, is among administration officials being subpoenaed to appear on Capitol Hill this week against the wishes of the White House.”



Former top Russia aide talks, too - Politico: “President Donald Trump’s former top Russia aide arrived on Capitol Hill Monday to testify before House impeachment investigators, as Democrats accelerate efforts to unearth the facts of Rudy Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy with top Ukrainian officials. Democrats view Fiona Hill’s closed-door testimony as critical to their understanding of the extent to which Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, bypassed official U.S. government channels by pressuring Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election.”



Hairy situation: Inside the botched effort to hire Trey Gowdy - NYT: “For 24 hours last week, Trey Gowdy, the former South Carolina congressman best known for leading congressional investigations of Hillary Clinton, was the new face of President Trump’s outside legal defense and a symbol of a streamlined effort to respond to a fast-moving impeachment inquiry. A day later, the arrangement fell apart, with lobbying rules prohibiting Mr. Gowdy from starting until January, possibly after the inquiry is over. Now, according to two people familiar with events, Mr. Gowdy is never expected to join the team. And Trump advisers are back to square one, searching for a different lawyer.”



House impeachment roadmap shaping up - Axios: “Ahead of this week's subpoenas and depositions, new documents obtained by Axios show how Democrats are taking the impeachment inquiry in two tightly focused directions: Ukraine and obstruction of justice. Why it matters: There are new temptations for Democrats to broaden the scope of their inquiry after developments last week including President Trump's gift to Turkey, new questions about coordination with the Chinese over Hunter Biden, and the dramatic airport arrests of two of Rudy Giuliani's associates with Eastern European backgrounds and their indictments on campaign finance violations. But for now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be sticking with her instincts to keep the probe tight and as simple as possible for Americans to understand.”



RNC spends to tweak vulnerable House Dems on impeachment - McClatchy: “Republicans are planning to target Democrats in swing districts with a new round of ads on impeachment this week as lawmakers return from their fall recess. The Republican National Committee will spend $350,000 on a multi-media buy as part of a strategy that includes digital ads, text messages and phone calls starting Tuesday calling on Democratic House members to 'stop the madness.' The effort is primarily targeted at the 31 Democrats in districts President Donald Trump carried in 2016. ‘We’ll emphasize it’s time to move on,’ RNC spokesman Rick Gorka told McClatchy. ‘There are real issues they could be working on, anything but this.’ Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Georgia, who supports an impeachment inquiry, is one of the GOP targets.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Was Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch an Obama appointee or a Trump appointee? If she was a holdover from the Obama years doesn’t make a little bit of sense for Trump to do some housecleaning? From what I understand some Ambassador appointments are given to friends and people who do something (in the campaign) to help the president get into office.” – Mary Blanton, Alpharetta, Ga.



[Ed. note: There are all different kinds of ambassadors, Ms. Blanton. There are two main categories: political appointees and career diplomats. Among the “political” there are two broad groups: Positions of such import that presidents want trusted confidantes and loyalists. Then there are postings to places so safe and stable that they can be doled out to donors and key supporters as patronage plums. The divide on the “career” side is similar. Some are to places of little strategic importance but are so poor and/or remote that fat cats wouldn’t want to perch there. But many are to places where the work is just too sensitive to risk amateurism. Our ambassadors face terrible risks on a regular basis in places around the world where, but do so in service of crucial American goals. We want top people with deep knowledge of the language, culture and history of places like Iraq, Turkey and, yes, Ukraine, to serve in such posts. Yovanovitch is one of these folks. She was appointed to her former post by then-President Obama. But before that, George W. Bush appointed her to the strategically important former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. She started in the Foreign Service in 1986. She’s a lifer. So while it’s true that she was an Obama appointee, it’s probably better to think of her as a product of our Foreign Service system more than anything else.]



“I would love to hear your reaction to the following idea: There should be a law that the federal government cannot tax any citizen at a rate in excess of 33 1/3%. This is to prevent any candidate from getting votes by simply suggesting that they will tax ‘the rich’ at 50%, 60% or 70%. Low income people are apt to vote for those candidates for the wrong reason. What say you?” – Ted Boers, Grand Rapids, Mich.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Boers, but you’d have to quickly come up with a LOT of additional dough. Rich people – the 40 percent of highest earners – pay something like 70 percent of all the taxes. If you knock down the two top tax rates – 37 percent and 35 percent – that would be a lot of money off the table. Leaving aside that practical consideration, there’s this one: You’d really need a constitutional amendment to do what you’re describing. It’s very hard to imagine getting supermajority support for something that would immediately be unpopular with the bottom 60 percent of earners. In the coming fiscal disasters awaiting America, we’re going to have some tough fights over taxes and spending – the very fights lawmakers have been pushing off for decades. It’s going to be ugly and weird and a number of proposals once considered unthinkable will suddenly sound mainstream. Fiscal conservatives would probably do better to get ready for that moment.]



“In quite deservedly praising Cardinal shortstop Paul DeJong you parenthetically asked ‘(whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?).’ Does the name Ernie (Let’s play two) Banks ring a bell? In the four years from 1957 through 1960 when he was the Cubs regular shortstop he hit 176 home runs (yearly average 44), leading the league twice. Over that same period, he drove in 491 runs (yearly average 123), again twice leading the league. He wasn’t just an offensive force, winning a Gold Glove for his defensive play in 1960. Additionally, he was the National League Most Valuable Player in both 1958 and 1959 despite playing for a sorry team that in both years finished fifth in an eight team league. So, to answer your question — I have, as have the many others who undoubtedly have written to point out your egregious error. (I still love you).” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: There’s always a Cubs fan out there! Always! You are quite right, Mr. Foys. Other than to a lesser degree Robin Yount and Derek Jeter, Banks is the cream of the power hitting shortstop crop. I’m including your note for two reasons: 1) Goodness knows Cubs fans need something to be cheerful about in October 2) Maybe this expression of goodwill will help snap the Cardinals out of their slough of despair against the Nats!]

Metro: “A rhino was filmed going for a walkabout in a crowded market. The animal casually strolled past liquor shops and clothes showrooms in Nepal as shocked members of the public looked on. What was probably more surprising is no-one seemed to be scared of the rhino, which had strayed from the popular Chitwan National Park. Some tourists were so comfortable they even took selfies with the large beast on Thursday. Shankar Kandu Ravi, 31, from Uttar Pradesh in India, followed the elusive animal for about ten minutes and then took a picture with it. … Mr. Ravi said the rhino even came face-to-face with a couple but didn’t attack anyone. He added: ‘It was just acting to scare the couple. It warned people to not come close.’ ‘Next morning, I had inquired about it and learnt that it returned to the jungle early in the morning.’”

Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, tweeted Monday morning that the president “has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.”

The New York Times reported that the video was played during a conference held by American Priority, a pro-Trump group, at Trump National Doral Miami. The event was not hosted by the president or his reelection campaign. A Trump campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, told the paper: “That video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.”

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS ‘CAPITALIST’

The White House Correspondents Association said in a statement it was “horrified” by the video.

“The WHCA is horrified by a video reportedly shown over the weekend at a political conference organized by the president’s supporters at the Trump National Doral in Miami,” said Jonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association and a journalist at ABC News. “All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the president’s political opponents.”

The White House Correspondents Association called on Trump himself to denounce the video.

“We have previously told the president his rhetoric could incite violence,” Karl said. “Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.”

According to the newspaper, the video seems to be an edited scene from a movie called the “Kingsman: The Secret Service.” The edited video shows the president’s head superimposed on a man opening fire inside a church — described in the video as the “Church of Fake News.” Those being shot in the pews have logos of media organizations on them.

The New York Times said a number of the president’s top allies were scheduled to appear at the conference, including his son Donald Trump Jr., former White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The paper said Sanders and Trump Jr. both said they did not see the video.

In the interview, Reid said he used to believe Trump was not very smart, but his view has changed.

“I don't think he's intellectually a powerhouse, but I think he's basically a very, very smart man. No matter what the subject, any argument he involves himself in, it's on his terms.

In reality, the congresswoman’s plan would bring about a national nightmare – not just for all of us alive today, but for future generations – because it would destroy the U.S. economy. Building it back up would take a very long time.

Ocasio-Cortez labels her absurd plan A Just Society. If you regret not being born early enough to enjoy the fun times of the Great Depression, or want to live in a “workers’ paradise” like North Korea, Venezuela or Cuba, you’ll love Comrade AOC’s plan.

AOC GETS CHOKED UP AT CLIMATE FORUM: 'MY DREAMS OF MOTHERHOOD ARE NOW BITTERSWEET'

Incredibly, this cockeyed plan has been praised by one of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination – Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

“It's going to take big, structural change to tackle poverty and inequality in the U.S., and @AOC's ‘A Just Society’ is just the type of bold, comprehensive thinking we'll need to get it done,” Warren recently tweeted.

Like her Green New Deal and other wacko plans, Ocasio-Cortez’s latest attempt to fundamentally transform the United States into a bastion of Marxism would end up erasing the tremendous economic growth Americans have experienced not just under the Trump administration, but throughout American history.

Ocasio-Cortez says her legislation, which is composed of several different bills, would “combat one of the greatest threats to our country, our democracy, and our freedom: economic inequality.”

There aren’t enough rich people to pay for AOC’s grandiose plans, even if government confiscated all their money and left them penniless and homeless.

That’s right, folks, you can forget about terrorism, trade wars, America’s $22 trillion debt, skyrocketing health insurance costs and every other significant problem facing the country. Apparently, the real threat to Americans’ health and welfare is that Amazon head Jeff Bezos has too many billions of dollars in investments and Bill Gates – the world’s most generous philanthropist – owns too many houses.

The Just Society plan would solve America’s alleged wealth gap “problem” by – surprise – dramatically expanding the power of the federal government and its welfare programs and running up tens of trillions of dollars in new debt in the process.

There aren’t enough rich people to pay for AOC’s grandiose plans, even if government confiscated all their money and left them penniless and homeless. Like a credit card bill that keeps growing, at some point Ocasio-Cortez’s trillions of dollars in massive new spending would have to be paid for – meaning gigantic tax increases for all of us, our children, grandchildren and beyond.

The most important part of the Just Society proposal is that it would substantially expand the meaning of “poverty” so that potentially tens of millions of additional Americans would be considered legally impoverished and made newly eligible for numerous welfare programs. These include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly referred to as food stamps.

You know the old saying that there’s no such thing as a free lunch? Comrade AOC would hand out free breakfasts, lunches and dinners, among many other free benefits. Perhaps the Tooth Fairy, little elves living in trees, or space aliens landing in Area 51 would foot the bill.

Ocasio-Cortez’s Recognizing Poverty Act would direct “the Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Bureau of Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics, to adjust the federal poverty line to account for geographic cost variation, costs related to health insurance, work expenses for the family, child care needs, and new necessities, like internet access.”

As Matt Weidinger of the American Enterprise Institute notes, a 2018 report found that if the standard used in Ocasio-Cortez’s legislation were applied to the residents of New York City, roughly 40 percent of all households would be considered impoverished, compared to only 14 percent under the current standards.

Altering the poverty line in accordance with Comrade AOC’s legislation would also push tens of millions of people onto the Children’s Health Insurance Program and Medicaid, among other programs.

In some cases, people would effectively have no choice but to be forced onto the government dole. For example, many of the families now receiving health insurance subsidies to purchase insurance plans in ObamaCare exchanges would suddenly become eligible for Medicaid and would no longer be able to have access to those subsidies. This would require them to choose between enrolling in Medicaid or paying the much higher, non-subsidy ObamaCare price for private insurance.

There are already more than 72 million people enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The Just Society plan would increase those numbers dramatically.

But that’s just the beginning. The Just Society proposal would also prevent government agents from denying convicted criminals access to federal welfare, health, disability, education, and other government social and welfare benefits on the basis of their conviction – regardless of how serious the offense was.

The same would be true for immigrants who are residing in the United States illegally. Under Ocasio-Cortez’s plan, immigration status cannot prevent welfare eligibility, giving millions of people now here in violation of federal law access to taxpayer-funded public benefits.

This one provision alone could destroy the American economy, because it would likely encourage millions of people from around the world to come to the United States to receive free services we have no way of paying for.

And, of course, Ocasio-Cortez doesn’t believe in immigration restrictions. Imagine tripling, quadrupling or further increasing the U.S. population with people from around the world looking for “free stuff.” How could the rest of us support them all?

Does forcing Americans to pay for food stamps and health care for non-Americans and college education for violent offenders sound “just” and “fair” to you?

The Just Society would also enact strict housing price controls on landlords, lowering the incentives for developers to construct new housing projects.

The U.S. economy is better now than at any time in recent memory. Unemployment is low for virtually every demographic, the stock market continues to remain at near-historic highs, and there are more than 7 million job openings.

I guess all that is considered “unjust” by Comrade AOC. Under her grand plan we’d all be equally impoverished, equally overtaxed, equally dependent on government assistance, and equally suffering in a socialist hell.

The Just Society is anything but. It should be rejected by every American with even an elementary school-level knowledge of how our economy works.

Perhaps this was because my personal reaction on reading the dossier was mild amusement at how very poorly it was written and how absurd the patently “salacious and unverified” allegations sounded.

In the end, what sounded like bogus claims turned out to be bogus claims.

You would think Democrats and their media allies would have learned a lesson from this nonexistent “Russia collusion” debacle. But Democrats have once again unquestioningly accepted hearsay allegations from a politically biased source in the whistleblower complaint.

GOP SEN. KEVIN CRAMER SAYS ATTACKS ON TRUMP WILL NEVER CEASE: 'HATERS ARE GOING TO HATE'

Perhaps strangest of all in this strangest of political times, Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry based on these allegations before even seeing either the complaint itself or a transcript of the call to which it referred.

Though I rarely agree with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on policy, I don’t think she’s stupid. So I was puzzled by her willingness to pursue this extremely risky step without anything approaching evidence of serious wrongdoing.

I thought perhaps a combination of the pending election, the weak slate of potential Democratic presidential nominees, plus President Trump’s increasingly obvious economic success, had created political desperation so intense that Pelosi’s only choice was to take an extreme political risk.

At this point, I asked myself, what else have they got? Elizabeth Warren? A Hillary Clinton rematch? Seriously?

But then it occurred to me that this could all make sense. People tend to believe that others will do what they themselves would do if faced with similar choices. No one wants to believe other people would make choices morally superior to their own.

This certainly explains the rush to accept the Steele dossier’s absurd claims. According to The New York Times: “Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and the D.N.C. by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates – including possible connections with Russia. It was at that point that Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele, who has deep sourcing in Russia, to gather information.”

Whether you call this opposition research (meaning Democrats did it) or collusion (meaning Republicans did it), it’s certainly easy to see why Democrats incorrectly believed nominee Trump would look to Russia for information that could influence the election. It was the very conduct in which the Democrats had engaged.

How about the whistleblower’s complaint? Well, again according to The New York Times, former Vice President Joe Biden “threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine’s leaders did not dismiss the country’s top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption.” Not coincidentally, the prosecutor “was soon voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament.”

So did anyone associated with Biden benefit from his actions? Well, Mr. Biden’s son Hunter “had a stake in the outcome” as he was “paid as much as $50,000 per month” for being “on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.”

Whether you call this fighting corruption (meaning a Democrat did it) or an abuse of power (meaning a Republican did it), it’s once again easy to see why Democrats would so easily believe that President Trump threatened to withhold foreign aid to obtain a personal benefit. It’s exactly what Democrats did under similar circumstances.

Less than one day after Pelosi announced her impeachment inquiry, President Trump discredited the whistleblower’s allegations by releasing a rough transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

The rough transcript shows that Trump did not condition foreign aid on any action by Zelensky. Zelensky has since confirmed that he didn’t feel any such pressure from Trump.

The transcript also shows that Zelensky, not Trump, brought up Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani visiting Ukraine to investigate corruption. And despite incredibly biased media coverage to the contrary, the only “favor” Trump requested in the call concerned investigating foreign interference in our 2016 election – a subject that used to be of great interest to Democrats.

In reality, if someone suggested withholding aid to pressure a foreign power into besmirching a political opponent, President Trump would be the first person in the room to say “No way” – or likely something far more graphic and inappropriate to repeat here.

But much like the false “Russiagate” debacle, because of their willingness to believe President Trump would act as they would in similar circumstances, the Democrats (and their media allies) now find themselves prematurely committed to an impeachment inquiry based on the flimsiest of justifications.

I fully expect their hollow abuse of power claims to continue. They have no choice at this point. They will continue to stir up a lot of dust and when the dust settles, once again, there will be nothing there.

I think Nate Silver makes a good point when he says that there are some candidates in the contest for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination who are doing better than expectations but only Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are actually doing well. They’re really the only ones who can be satisfied that they’re meeting their own expectations for progress. We’re almost to the point that we can begin to think of this as a two-person race.

In looking at national polls pre- and post-September 23 (the date Silver uses as the beginning of the impeachment process), there are a few interesting observations we can make. The first is that Biden is actually slightly up despite having his name dragged through the mud. It would probably be fairer to say that he’s holding steady, but there’s no sign in erosion. This appears to be the case for most of the candidates, too, as the majority of them, like Biden, are up or down less than a point.

But that doesn’t mean the polls have been static. Elizabeth Warren has gained a substantial 5.7 percent and is now nearing parity with Biden. Almost all of her gains appear to have come from Kamala Harris (down 2.6 percent), Cory Booker (down 1.3 percent) and Bernie Sanders (down 1.1 percent).

Sanders is actually weathering the fallout from his heart attack surprisingly well, but his campaign has been losing slow and steady ground to Warren for a couple of months now. He’s now looking like a second tier candidate, albeit the only second tier candidate in the race. The real news here is that Kamala Harris has fallen to 4.7 percent in the national polls. This appears to be fatal to her campaign hopes, as she really need to move upward into the teens to sustain a serious operation.

I suspect Harris doesn’t have much time to right her ship, but there is one small hopeful sign. She’s seems to have lost the battle with Warren for voters who were undecided between the two of them, but she’s also the logical landing point for these voters if Warren’s campaign badly falters in the coming months. I think her model was more reliant on Biden faltering so she could pick up some fleeing moderates, but at this point I think she’d need both Warren and Biden to collapse to get back into contention.

National polls only tell part of the story, of course. In Iowa, Warren has led in two of three recent polls and Sanders remains very much in the running. In New Hampshire, Warren had led in all three of the most recent polls and Sanders has slipped into a distant third place. Yet, Biden enjoys a narrow lead in Nevada (where Bernie Sanders looks competitive) and a massive lead in South Carolina.

Since there’s an advantage to winning the earliest contests, I think Warren looks like she’s in the best position right now. But she doesn’t have Iowa locked down by an means (RCP Avg. Warren 22.7, Biden 19.3, Sanders 16.0).

For both Biden and Sanders, it would be a very bad development if Warren were to win Iowa because it would probably solidify her advantage in New Hampshire and give her a sweep of the first two contests. Sanders would be effectively knocked out, I think, because it will kill his chances in Nevada and any chance of coming in second place in South Carolina. Biden is in a better position to recover from losing the first two (or even three) battles because of his strong lead in South Carolina. If he were to lose in Iowa and New Hampshire (and perhaps Nevada as well), I’m not sure that his lead in the Palmetto State would hold up, and it certainly would narrow.

While Sanders probably needs to win Iowa in order to survive, Biden would be in a decent position losing there provided that the winner were anybody other than Warren.

I suppose there is still plenty of time for the top three candidates to stumble or for a lower tier candidate to catch fire, but the eventual dynamics of the race seems to be coming into view. Iowa looks huge. As I wrote back on September 19, Kamala Harris has put all her chips on Iowa, so it will be decisive for her campaign. That appears to be the case for Sanders, too. Warren will be sitting pretty if she wins the Hawkeye State but in much more of a dogfight if she does not. And Biden really needs to avoid an outcome where Warren carries the first two states.

This is a very stupid way to decide a nomination. I’ve written that the Iowa caucuses are a fraud and should be doomed. It’s a subject that I will no doubt return to many times before Iowan Democrats turn out in the cold next winter to decide the fate of the country.

For now, I’ll just remind you of what happened in Iowa in 2012.

…an initial and preliminary count of the votes indicated that Mitt Romney had won the caucuses by eight votes. And that is how the media reported it. Yes, Rick Santorum had come out of nowhere to finish a shockingly strong second place, but he hadn’t won anything. Romney, who had suffered the indignity of lagging behind in the polls (at one time or another) to everyone in the race except Santorum, had managed to right his ship and avoid a bad stumble out of the gate. This was hugely helpful to him as the contest moved to Romney’s home turf in New Hampshire. Remember, not only had he served as governor in neighboring Massachusetts, but he owned a home in New Hampshire. Two weeks later, however, and after Romney romped to victory in the Granite State, the Iowa Republican Party had to make two embarrassing announcements. The first was that they had finalized counting the votes and that it turned out that Rick Santorum didn’t have an eight vote deficit but instead a 34-vote lead. The second announcement was that it was impossible to actually declare a winner [because results from eight of 1,774 precincts could not be located for certification] …In 2012, Iowa had 28 delegates at the convention, and according to the New York Times, Ron Paul got 22 of them, Romney got five, and Rick Santorum got zero. One vote is listed as undetermined but probably went for Romney… …you can justifiably say that Santorum won Iowa because he had the most votes in the certified count, or that Romney won because he benefited the most from the result, or that Ron Paul won because he actually got almost all the delegates, or that no one won because the party refused to declare a winner.

The Democratic caucuses operate with slightly different rules in Iowa, but it remains a beauty contest where the delegates are not decided or committed to any candidate regardless of results. It literally does not matter who wins in determining how the delegates will be awarded. Yet, the perception that someone won has a gigantic impact on the media coverage, and next year this looks to be truer and more consequential than ever."

BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS’ PLAN: ECONOMISTS

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ""I am a capitalist to my bones.""

Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ""will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

A Gallup poll this year found that 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, while 51 percent say it would be a bad thing. Gallup noted that in 1942, a Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing while only 25 percent called it a good thing.

The polling is fresh evidence that attitudes toward socialism are changing, amid the popularity in the Democratic Party of Democratic socialists like Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pushes policies like “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal.

Meanwhile, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, claim that billionaires could face a 97.5 percent average effective tax rate under Sanders' plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020.

Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told Bloomberg that “with the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes."" The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan.

The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent for fortunes in excess of $10 billion.

Sanders vowed to go further than Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires’ fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren.

Sanders’ plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders’ tax rates don’t top out until 8 percent for the richest households.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., actually defeat President Trump in the 2020 presidential election? Democrats watching Trump’s Minneapolis rally Thursday night have to wonder.

President Trump wowed the crowd in blue-state Minnesota. And what a crowd it was; tens of thousands inside the arena chanting and cheering, while hundreds more stood outside hoping to get in. The energy in the room was extraordinary, especially considering that the president, buoyed by his fans, spoke for an exhausting hour and 45 minutes.

Forget the polls, forget the partisan impeachment inquiry; the enthusiasm of those Minnesota supporters reminds us how powerful Trump is on the campaign trail and how lackluster Democratic candidates look in comparison.

TRUMP BELITTLES BIDENS WITH GRAPHIC LANGUAGE AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY, AS CHAOS UNFOLDS OUTSIDE ARENA

Could Biden rouse such a crowd? Warren?

Trump’s enduring popularity with Republicans reminds us, too, that GOP senators would be committing political suicide if they voted to toss the president from office in an impeachment trial. They won’t do it.

How does President Trump excite his supporters? It’s his authenticity. Democrats will mock that claim. They protest that Trump lies and exaggerates; they fact-check his speeches and burrow in on discrepancies, but they miss the big picture.

President Trump famously goes “off-script” at such gatherings, and sometimes the results are painful. Saying Biden “kissed Obama’s ass” was vulgar; Trump should not have gone there.

Hating Donald Trump is not a compelling platform.

But sometimes, Trump’s best moments are when he recounts scenes he has experienced as president, like witnessing the coffins of fallen soldiers come off a plane from some hostile land. He recalls the anguish of the families who just minutes before were “fine,” but who are then devastated by that tragic sight. There is no doubt that Trump, too, is crushed by the loss of another fine young American.

There is also no doubt that those scenes have prompted Trump’s much-criticized decision to pull out of Syria. The entire foreign policy establishment has declared his move reckless; he has been denounced for “betraying” the Kurds by friends and foes alike.

But, as with so many issues where Trump has upset the established order, there is a kernel of common sense behind the president’s move.

Americans do not want to be the lone policeman in the Middle East. We expect our European allies, in particular, to also step up. Their refusal to take any responsibility for dealing with ISIS prisoners, for instance, is unacceptable; they, too, have been attacked by terrorists.

From the day he took office, President Trump told the State Department and the Pentagon he wanted to bring our troops home. Both those agencies are accustomed to operating as they choose; they did not take his demands seriously and failed to produce a plan to fulfill that campaign promise.

This is what drives his enemies crazy and his fans to love him more. The president, I am told, keeps a chart on a wall outside his office listing the promises he made to voters. Some are checked off – like reducing taxes, moving our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and exiting the Paris Climate Accords. Some remain undone. Those remaining pledges drive his policymaking.

Which president has ever done such a thing? None that I know of.

In Minneapolis, Trump talked up his administration’s job creation and strong economy – a powerful message backed up by another spike in consumer sentiment – and also took potshots at rival Biden.

A local ABC affiliate covering the speech reported: “Trump has been spreading groundless claims that the Bidens used their family name to get China and Ukraine to pay them millions of dollars.”

Are those claims “groundless?” Not really. Who doubts that Hunter Biden cashed in on his father’s prominence as vice president and as point person for the Obama administration in Ukraine and China? Hunter traveled with his father on Air Force Two to China and within a matter of weeks Hunter’s barely-there firm Rosemont Seneca entered into a new partnership with state-owned Bank of China and went on to raise $1.5 billion.

Trump rightly told the Minnesota crowd that the Chinese are tough negotiators and do not part with their money easily.

There may have been no legal lines crossed by the Bidens, but Hunter’s business dealings and Joe’s tolerance of them do not appear ethical.

Similarly, the president may not have broken the law when he asked Ukraine’s president to investigate the former vice president and his son, but his now-notorious phone call appears underhanded. Does it rise to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors?” Democrats must think so. They apparently believe that impeaching President Trump will help them win in 2020.

Democrats are encouraged by polling that shows most Americans open to the impeachment inquiry. That’s because our country is fair-minded and considers no one above the law.

On the other hand, Americans expect such a serious task as an impeachment inquiry to be done openly and in a nonpartisan manner. That is not what is taking place.

In putting Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in charge of the probe, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., eliminated any possibility that Trump supporters would view the proceedings as above-board.

Schiff is reviled by many for having spun endless false charges that the president colluded with Russia, lying repeatedly that he had conclusive “proof.”

Now it turns out that Schiff lied again, denying that his office had met with the whistleblower, shredding Americans’ confidence in the proceedings. At the same time, he is holding closed-door interviews and testimony, all seemingly designed to keep the public from knowing what Trump did or did not do.

Recent polling shows little increase in support for impeachment since the investigation got underway.

My guess: enthusiasm for the proceedings will wane further as voters become disgusted with how Schiff is managing the investigation, and as no new charges result from the endless interviews and subpoenas.

What will Democrats run on then? They have not passed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, or an immigration compromise, or an infrastructure bill, nor have they done anything serious about prescription drug prices.

Would his successor pull a Ford and pardon him? 2020 Dems are starting to weigh in on the question.",2019-10-15,MSNBC,Biden: No pardon for Trump if he's indicted after 2020,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/biden-no-pardon-trump-if-hes-indicted-after-2020,"Former Vice President Joe Biden sat down with Radio Iowa this week and answered a question I haven’t heard him address before.

During an interview with Radio Iowa later Sunday afternoon, Biden said if he is elected, he will not follow President Ford’s example in pardoning Nixon so Nixon was not prosecuted for his role in Watergate. “It wouldn’t unite the country,” Biden said. “You’d say: ‘Wait a minute. I get a parking ticket and I’ve got to pay it. This happens to me and I’ve got to go to jail. This guy does all these things that put us jeopardy and he gets off? I think this is of a different nature. And I think President Ford, God love him, he’s a good guy, I knew him pretty well. I think if he had to do it over again, he wouldn’t have done it … because he didn’t get re-elected.”

As regular readers know, I’ve been keeping an eye on this for a while, because for Donald Trump, winning a second term next year is about more than just power and ego; it’s also about the statute of limitations.

After all, the president has been implicated in a variety of alleged crimes, though Trump appears to be shielded from prosecution so long as he’s in office. If he were to lose in 2020, that shield would disappear, and the prospect of an indictment would become quite real. Indeed, by most accounts, the only way for Trump to ensure he faces no criminal liability is for him to remain president for another four years.

But let’s say he doesn’t. For the sake of conversation, let’s imagine Trump not only loses the popular vote again, but also comes up short in the electoral college. Let’s also say it’s 2021 and the president’s Democratic successor, recognizing the possibility of Trump facing an indictment, has to decide whether to pull a Gerald Ford and issue a pardon for his/her scandal-plagued predecessor.

Biden is now committed to not pardoning Trump, and the Delaware Democrat isn’t alone.

In late February, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) got the ball rolling in a blog post published to Medium. “[L]et me be perfectly clear, in the way that everyone who might be President next should be: If I’m elected President of the United States, there will be no pardons for anyone implicated in these investigations. Everyone who might succeed Donald Trump as president should adopt the same policy.”

Two weeks later, MSNBC’s Chris Matthews sat down with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and brought up Ford’s 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon. “Would you consider pardoning Trump if you took the presidency?” the host asked.

Booker didn’t hesitate. “No,” the senator said.

In May, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) was asked if he’d be willing to pardon Trump. “Uh, no,” the governor replied. “I would not.”

Circling back to our earlier coverage, as 2020 issues go, this one is inherently speculative. No one can say with confidence whether a prosecutor would even want to try to indict Trump after he leaves office.

It’s far easier to say, however, that the Republican’s criminal liability is real, and if a Democrat wins the presidency next year, he or she will have to at least consider the possibility of seeing his or her predecessor face criminal charges.

Don’t be surprised if every Democratic candidate goes on the record on this issue in the coming weeks and months.

Postscript: I’ve highlighted the comments from Biden, Booker, Bullock, and Warren because they crossed my radar, but it’s entirely possible that other Democratic candidates have weighed in. If campaign aides for the other Democratic candidates see this post, and they want me to update it with additional statements, I’m happy to do so."

Bernie Sanders released a plan on ""corporate accountability and democracy"" that attempts to go further than proposals from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a rival progressive.

In part of a plan to reign in ""corporate greed"" released by his campaign Monday, Sanders would create a new agency within the Department of Commerce called the ""Bureau of Corporate Governance."" It would issue charters to large companies requiring them to base their actions on more than just the interest of shareholders. The plan would apply to corporations with more than $100 million in annual revenue or balance sheet total and to all publicly traded companies.

That is a significantly lower threshold than the $1 billion bar for annual revenue Warren pushed earlier this year in a proposal that called for a similar bureau to be created called the ""Office of United States Corporations.""

""This new federal charter will require corporate boards to consider the interests of all of the stakeholders in a company,"" the post on Sanders' campaign website says, ""including workers, customers, shareholders, and the communities in which the corporation operates.""

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS 'CAPITALIST'

Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, has long railed against big business and capitalism in general, and his newest proposal seeks to use the government to mandate that companies take into account how their behavior affects ""society at large.""

In another attempted one-up of Warren, Sanders' plan would require public companies and corporations with more than $100 million in annual revenue or balance sheet total to have employees elect 45 percent of their boards of directors. A Warren plan would require just 40 percent of such boards to be elected by employees and would apply to companies with $1 billion or more in yearly revenue.

During a Sunday interview with ABC's ""This Week"", Sanders slammed Warren for previously saying she is a ""capitalist through her bones.""

""I'm not,"" he told interviewer Jonathan Karl.

ANA NAVARRO TELLS RAND PAUL NOT TO 'MANSPLAIN' IN DISCUSSION OF MADURO AND SOCIALISM

Sanders has battled with Warren for room in the progressive lane of the 2020 Democratic primary, with both seeking to provide a liberal alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden pitched himself to voters as a moderate compared to the rest of the Democratic field but could be a more vulnerable frontrunner than at any point in the campaign as he's been wrapped up in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

A Fox News survey released last week found Warren is beating Sanders by five points while Biden -- with 32 percent -- holds a significant 10-point lead over Warren.

After a heart attack earlier this month, Sanders will strive for a successful debate Tuesday, which could mollify some Democrats' fears about the 78-year-old's health.

""This year, the Business Roundtable released empty words recognizing the error in admitting corporations put profits and shareholder returns above everything else. Empty words are not enough,"" Sanders' website says in what could be a preview of his rhetoric Tuesday night. ""This plan will ensure that corporations conduct business in a fair way – a way that treats workers and the communities in which businesses operate with respect.""

Sanders' Monday post includes a long list of other progressive proposals, including reversing the Trump tax cut for corporations, a ban on noncompetes and forced arbitration, a provision giving the FTC unilateral authority to stop mergers without going to court and a requirement that large companies eventually become at least 20 percent employee-owned."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden locked in a close race for their party’s nomination.

Warren stood at 30 percent support in a Quinnipiac University survey Monday of Democratic voters and independents who leaned toward the party. Biden, the unrivaled front-runner until Warren’s surge in the polls the past couple of months, was at 27 percent.

Warren’s three percentage point advantage was within the survey’s margin of error.

GABBARD BACKS DOWN AFTER DEBATE BOYCOTT THREAT

The poll was the third conducted by Quinnipiac since late last month showing Warren with a slight edge over Biden.

“For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. “Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stood at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent.

Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking – but still large – field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.

Quinnipiac’s survey differed from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Twelve candidates qualified for Tuesday’s debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are – in alphabetical order – Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang.

While national primary horserace polls have grabbed plenty of attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. And, a new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.

Warren stood at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stood at 9 percent and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.

In New Hampshire’s Republican presidential contest, President Trump remained the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.

The Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University poll was conducted Oct. 9-13, with 422 likely Democratic primary voters and 405 likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 4.8 percentage points for Democratic primary questions and plus or minus 4.9 percentage points for GOP primary questions.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 11-13, with 1,195 self-identified registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey included 505 Democratic voters and independent voters leaning Democratic with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that she would no longer be accepting campaign donations of more than $200 from big businesses and challenged her fellow White House hopefuls to be more transparent about how they’re funding their own campaigns.

Warren blasted some of her Democratic primary rivals in a post on Medium, in which she accused them of “hobnobbing with the rich and powerful” and “handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors.”

“I’m proud to be running a grassroots-funded campaign for president, and I hope my fellow candidates for the Democratic nomination will do the same,” Warren wrote. “That’s why I’m also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign…and to disclose the dates and locations of their fundraising events and the names of every person who appears on a host committee on invitations tied to those events.”

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Warren added: “If Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so – but they shouldn’t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors. Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition — and how much it costs.”

In her post, Warren does not specifically call out any of her fellow candidates, but her words appear to be a rebuke of Democratic presidential primary hopefuls like former Vice President Joe Bide, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Each of these candidates have raised millions of dollars through fundraisers and private events with wealthy donors — a practice that is common in both major political parties in the U.S.

Warren, along with fellow candidate and Vermont lawmaker Bernie Sanders, have spurned big-dollar donors this campaign season, in favor of relying on small-dollar, online donations. The results have surprisingly seen them outraising other candidates last quarter.

Warren’s critics have slammed her for holding fundraisers in the past and using some of the money left in her war chest to launch her 2020 presidential bid. But since announcing her candidacy, Warren has not taken any PAC or big-dollar donations.

“I’m not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,” Warren wrote. “And when I’m the Democratic nominee for president, I’m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists. No special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign.”

Despite outraising most other candidates last quarter, Warren’s rivals still say that the small-dollar donations will hinder her chances of defeating President Trump should she win the Democratic nomination.

“We're not going to beat him with pocket change,"" Buttigieg said in a Snapchat post, adding that Democrats ""need the full spectrum of support in order to compete.”"

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate, as former Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

All of the 12 Democrats onstage in Westerville, Ohio, meanwhile, backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

The debate marked the first time the candidates met since Pelosi's news conference last month at which she unilaterally declared the inquiry had begun -- a move that the White House has said is legally insufficient. The candidate lineup set a record for most politicians on a single debate stage, topping the 11 Republican candidates who assembled in 2016.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

""Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry,"" Warren, D-Mass., asserted at the outset of the debate, when asked why Congress should bother with the process given the impending election.

Biden has been at the top of the crowded field for months, but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

The elder Biden faced something of a timid confrontation over the issue during the debate, when CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper broached the topic by stating, without evidence, that President Trump's accusations of misconduct by the Bidens were ""false.""

But Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. (“I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,” the younger Biden said Tuesday morning.)

Joe Biden recently pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were to be elected president -- a tacit admission, Republicans said, of previous poor judgment or even wrongdoing.

""Look, my son's statement speaks for itself,"" Biden said. “My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government which was to root out corruption in Ukraine, and that’s what we should be focusing on.”

Biden insisted he never discussed Ukraine matters with Hunter, although Hunter separately told The New Yorker magazine that the dealings had come up in one instance.

He concluded: ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on.""

Later on, as the debate heated up, Biden remarked: “These debates are kinda crazy."" In a head-turning moment, he also stumbled over his words, saying wealthy individuals might be found ""clipping coupons in the stock market.""

Separately, asked about Trump's policy in Syria, Biden appeared to give an extended answer in which he meant to talk about Turkish President Recep Erdoğan -- but kept referencing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad instead.

HUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON HOW HE OBTAINED LUCRATIVE GIGS WITH NO RELEVANT EXPERTISE, BUT A VERY POWERFUL FATHER

Asked about his health toward the end of the debate, Biden vowed to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses are held, and said his age (76) gives him ""wisdom.""

Hunter Biden obtained other high-paying board positions domestically and internationally, with no relevant expertise, while his father was a senator and vice president. For example, Hunter became an executive at the financial services company MBNA just two years after leaving law school. MBNA sources told Fox News this week that the company was trying to curry favor with Joe Biden, who was shepherding a bill favored by MBNA to passage in the Senate.

Meanwhile, Warren has climbed to co-front runner status but faces new questions about her dubious claims to Native American ancestry.

She was under attack from all sides at the debate for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class.

""I appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said to Warren. ""At least Bernie’s being honest here. ... I’m sorry, Elizabeth.”

“These debates are kinda crazy."" — Joe Biden

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also lambasted Warren on health care: “Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" he said.

Buttigieg specifically knocked Warren for the nonanswer, saying her failure to offer a direct answer is ""why people are so frustrated with politicians"" and arguing that ""Medicare-for-All"" would ""unnecessarily divide this country.""

""We heard it tonight,"" Buttigieg said. ""A yes-or-no question that didn't get a yes-or-no answer."" He said he wanted a plan that could be summed up as ""Medicare-for-All"" if you choose it, not whether you want it or not.

Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke also pressed Warren on the tax issue, to no avail. (Later on, O'Rourke had no answer when Cooper asked how he could confiscate Americans' firearms, given that the government has no way of knowing where the vast majority of AR-15s are located. He said only that he believes Americans ""will do the right thing"" voluntarily.)

Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the ""Medicare-for-All"" legislation that Warren has embraced, said it was ""appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up.""

Sanders, who Fox News has confirmed will soon be endorsed by New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also spoke about his recent heart attack: “But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. ... And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Also during the debate, Democrats also piled onto Warren for her signature proposal, a 2 percent wealth tax to raise the trillions needed for many of her ambitious proposals. Technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang noted that such a measure has failed in almost every European country where it's been tried.

The event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, was on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

Many of the candidates were struggling just to get noticed — trying to make up ground in a race that kicks off officially in just over three months with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are trying to crack the top tier.

In one possible indicator the debate was a lengthy one, Harris briefly mentioned her proposal to have Twitter take Trump's account down, and demanded that Warren explain why she felt that approach was unwise. Warren, who last week laughed openly when informed by a reporter of Harris' idea, responded that she wants Trump out of the White House, not just banned from Twitter.

Progressives and right-wing commentators alike were aghast at Harris' decision to again bring up the unrealistic and unpopular idea of somehow suspending Trump from Twitter.

""I cannot believe @KamalaHarris is pushing this suspend Donald Trump's twitter account bullshit at a presidential debate,"" former Obama administration official and Pod Save America cohost Tommy Vietor wrote on Twitter. ""It's so small ball. She is bigger and better than this.""

Fellow Obama administration alumnus and podcast host Ben Rhodes added: ""Seems like there are bigger issues in the world.""

Also debating were Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Obama housing chief Julián Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Making his debate debut — and likely angling for a splash — was billionaire activist Tom Steyer.

Gabbard hit The New York Times and CNN for waging what she called a propaganda campaign against her, while also promoting endless ""regime-change wars.""

""The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Gabbard has criticized Trump for how he's conducted the withdrawal in Syria, but said Tuesday that while Trump has ""the blood of the Kurds on his hands. ... So do many of the politicians in both parties who supported this regime change war.""

Gabbard, who was one of the last Democratic House members to back an impeachment inquiry, additionally lamented that some Democrats had been calling for Trump's impeachment since right after the 2016 election, undermining the party's case against him.

The debate's foreign policy discussion concluded without any mention by the moderators of the ongoing push by China to censor American companies, including the NBA and Blizzard Entertainment, from making or tolerating pro-Hong Kong statements. Buttigieg briefly mentioned that the Hong Kong protests were not receiving support from the White House.

Yang's plan for a universal basic income spurred a discussion onstage concerning whether a federal jobs guarantee is a better plan -- something of a remarkable achievement for Yang, who has struggled in the polls while advancing his own unique agenda.

On abortion, the Democrats agreed they would support a federal law ""codifying"" the Supreme Court's holding in Roe v. Wade, which found a constitutional right to abortion, as a kind of defense in case the Supreme Court overturned Roe. At the same time, Biden emphasized he would not support ""court packing,"" or passing a federal law to expand the size of the Supreme Court to load it with Democratic justices.

Buttigieg then said he did not support court packing, but wanted ""reforms"" to make the court less significant -- including possibly a ""fifteen member court, where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other ten."" A similar idea was being debated in the Yale Law Journal, Buttigieg said, in a shout-out to the left-wing student publication.

Gabbard said that Democrats were right decades ago when they said abortion should be ""safe, legal, and rare"" -- highlighting a shift to the left among Democrats.

The 2020 field, which once had swelled to two dozen, has been shrinking as the Democratic Party's rules have mandated that candidates meet higher donor and fundraising thresholds to debate.

Just 10 White House contenders qualified for September's debate, but Gabbard and Steyer made Tuesday's lineup a record.

Earlier contests featuring 20 candidates were divided between two nights.

Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told Bloomberg that “with the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes."" The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan.

The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent for fortunes in excess of $10 billion.

Sanders vowed to go further than Sen. Elizabeth Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires’ fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren.

Sanders’ plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders’ tax rates don’t top out until 8 percent for the richest households.

But, that’s just the first of many factors that could make this showdown – the first in a month – stand out.

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS A 'CAPITALIST'

“Since the last Democratic debate, the presidential race has dramatically shifted. Tonight is the first major gathering since the opening of the impeachment inquiry,” former Democratic National Committee chair and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile said.

The debate also comes as Joe Biden lost his long-held status as the unrivaled front-runner. The former vice president suddenly has been neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in many of the recent national and early-voting-state polls. And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and fellow progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

The showdown also comes two weeks after the 78-year old Sanders suffered a heart attack. The debate is set to mark his return to the campaign trail and with questions regarding his health and stamina, the independent senator making his second straight White House run will be under the microscope.

With all that in mind, here are eight things to watch at the debate.

Impeachment

The debate is the first held since House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was pressuring a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before the phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been put on hold; it ultimately was released in September. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, the president insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no “quid pro quo” and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

While all the candidates on the stage supported impeaching the president, the impeachment inquiry clearly will overshadow the showdown -- but will it dominate the debate to the detriment of other top issues in the Democrats’ presidential nomination race?

“There is a real danger that the substance of the debate is limited by the impeachment inquiry,” warned veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs at New England College.

Biden and Biden

While only one Biden will be on the stage, another certainly will be part of the conversation. While the former vice president is expected to use impeachment to frame the race as a fight between himself and the Republican incumbent, he likely will face questions about his son just hours after Hunter Biden’s first public interview since the start of the Ukrainian controversy.

As the president has fought back against impeachment, he and his allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on the Bidens.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden – as vice president – pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Trump’s also repeatedly raised questions about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Chinese private equity firm. This past Sunday, Hunter Biden resigned from the company – and on Tuesday morning – just hours before the debate – broke his silence in an interview with ABC News’ “Good Morning America.""

The younger Biden maintained that he did nothing improper while he served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company. But he acknowledged that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Some of Biden’s lower-tier rivals, looking for a breakout moment, may be tempted to criticize him over the optics of having his son sit on the boards of foreign companies while he served as vice president. However, it may be a slippery slope, as none of the Democrats seeking to unseat Trump may want to play into his playbook of targeting the Bidens.

Sanders’ health

“I’m ready,” Sanders emphasized in an email to supporters on Monday.

While all the candidates will be under the spotlight, it will shine extra bright for Sanders, who would have a unique challenge in needing to showcase that he hasn’t lost a step, and quell concerns that he may not be up to speed.

Analysts pointed out Sanders would need to show strength and agility, but the question for his rivals would be whether it’s a fair game for them to raise concerns about his health. Questions were raised about the late Sen. John McCain’s medical condition during the 2008 campaign and about the health of both candidates four years ago.

Sanders vs. Warren

Aside from some sniping by some of his top advisors, Sanders has not criticized Warren, as she’s mostly passed him by in the polls the past two months.

That’s why his labeling of his friend and populist senator – who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another – as a “capitalist” made so much news this weekend.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.” “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Will Sanders continue to draw contrasts with the rising Warren at the debate?

A former Sanders adviser – who for months raised alarms that Warren, rather than Biden, was the real threat – said the drawing of distinctions may be a necessity.

“Unfortunately, it’s a sign of concern on the part of Bernie and his camp that Warren is beating him with the voters that he needs,” noted Kurt Ehrenberg, a top adviser for Sanders in New Hampshire and the 2016 and 2020 campaigns who recently parted ways with the campaign.

A more aggressive Biden?

The former vice president seemed to get a second wind last week during two speeches in New Hampshire, when Biden gave a full-throated thrashing of Trump as he called for the president’s impeachment for the first time. Will that aggressive style of campaigning continue on the debate stage in Ohio?

“One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive,” Biden acknowledged during a fundraiser late last week in California. “I’ve had some difficulties on knowing to counterattack.”

A senior Biden campaign adviser told Fox News hours before the debate that ""what you'll hear tonight from the VP is that first and foremost, we have to keep the focus on Donald Trump's unprecedented abuse of power.""

Back in the spotlight

Health care – specifically the intra-party battle over “Medicare-for-all,” immigration, race relations and other domestically focused issues – has dominated the discourse at the first three rounds of debates. Foreign policy mostly has been relegated to the garbage time late in the showdowns, when the number of viewers dwindled.

But, with Turkey’s attack on northern Syria, unfolding soon after the president’s move to withdraw U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against ISIS militants, questions about Trump’s record on the world stage could be back in the spotlight.

That may benefit the candidates with foreign policy experience. Besides the obvious – Biden – such a discussion could give the two veterans in the field who’ve served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – a moment to shine.

Looking for a breakout moment

The debate could provide the opportunity the mid-tier candidates have been seeking – a standout moment in front of millions of viewers with less than four months to go until the voting begins in Iowa. Buttigieg, Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas all have been looking to gain some traction and break up the narrative that the race has been a three-candidate contest between Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

So will businessman and billionaire environment and progressive activist Tom Steyer, who’s making his first appearance on the debate stage.

Buttigieg – in a likely tease of things to come – took aim at Warren and Sanders for proposing to scrap private insurance as he touted his Medicare-for-all-who-want-it plan a new digital ad hours before the debate.

“Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished,” the narrator says in the ad.

Unpredictable moments

Gabbard made headlines in the second round of debates in July when she took aim at Harris, firing away at the former California attorney general’s record as a prosecutor. Last week, she made headlines when she threatened to boycott the debate to protest the “rigging” of the debates and the race for the nomination by the Democratic National Committee and its media partners.

Gabbard announced Monday morning that she would take part in the debate after all, and her planned appearance – after failing to qualify for the September showdown – had analysts wondering what she had next up here sleeve.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro also has been looking to make some news. Castro – whose attacks on Biden’s age and memory at the September debate backfired, according to many analysts – is set to appear on the stage for what could possibly be the last time.

With the thresholds rising for the November showdown, Castro made a fundraising pitch to supporters, telling them ""I refuse to let tonight be my last time on the debate stage.""

A big debate moment would give him a boost to reach the new qualifying criteria."

The ad, released on Monday night, featured clips of multiple commentators supporting his ""Medicare-for-all who want it"" plan. ""Mayor Pete said a 'Medicare-for-all who want it.' That seems like a much better formulation -- working towards a universal health care system but it doesn't wipe out private insurance,"" CNN commentator Van Jones says in the ad.

The video was released on day before Tuesday's fourth Democratic debate, likely an indication that Buttigieg would try and go on offense against ""Medicare-for-all"" proponents like Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

Previous Democratic debates have tended to focus on health care, which seems to be one of the primary sources of infighting among leading 2020 candidates. Former Vice President Joe Biden has borne the brunt of the criticism due to his desire to build on the Affordable Care Act enacted by former President Obama.

PETE BUTTIGIEG PROPOSES PUBLIC OPTION, SAYS IT COULD 'NATURALLY' LEAD TO 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

It's unclear how Buttigieg will address Biden but his ad mentioned Warren and Sanders by name. The spot claims that they want to abolish private insurance and suggests that labor unions might oppose Medicare for all because it would erase the previous gains they made in fighting for insurance.

Buttigieg's health plan offers a public option that includes automatic and retroactive enrollment for anyone without a private plan.

It's unclear how long Americans could maintain their private insurance under Buttigieg's plan, though, as he's already reinforced conservative fears about a public option providing unfair and ultimately destructive competition for private companies.

""If private insurers are unable or unwilling to offer better plans than they do today, competition from this public alternative will naturally lead to Medicare-for-all,"" he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed announcing the plan last month."

""Donald Trump is the definition of corruption,"" he tweeted. ""At every turn, he has abused the power of the presidency to benefit his bottom line and weaponized the Executive Branch to serve himself. I’ll ensure our government works for the people -- not just Donald Trump.""

Biden's pitch to Democratic voters is centered around his claim that he is the only Democrat guaranteed to defeat Trump in November 2020, an apparent nod to voters who worry that infighting will hurt any chance to finally remove the president from office.

Biden has also come under fire from the more progressive wing of the party. His health care plan, for example, has received criticism for not reforming the system enough, although he seeks to build on Obama's Affordable Care Act.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., often seen as a more progressive alternative, could use Tuesday's debate to attack Biden and solidify the recent lead she's gained over him in some polls."

On the roster: Biden son: Ukraine deals ‘poor judgement’ in ‘a swamp’ - Fight night in Ohio - Bolton called foul on Trump-Giuliani Ukraine moves - Giuliani got big bucks from indicted Ukrainian - For the long run



BIDEN SON: UKRAINE DEALS ‘POOR JUDGEMENT’ IN ‘A SWAMP’

ABC News: “As President Donald Trump continues to fill his Twitter feed and campaign speeches with attacks on Hunter Biden over his foreign business deals, the former vice president’s son defended the ethical implications of his private ventures in an interview with ABC News, but conceded taking a misstep in failing to foresee the political implications on his father’s career. ‘In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all,’ said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in—in—in many ways? Yeah.’”



Fight night in Ohio - Politico: “Bernie Sanders is recovering from his heart attack. Joe Biden is under siege, and laying into Donald Trump. And the entire Democratic presidential field has become consumed with the House’s impeachment inquiry into the Republican president. With so many candidates responding to circumstances beyond their control — and the threat of a destabilizing moment running high on a stage that’s expanding to 12 candidates from 10 — it’s raising the specter of a debate Tuesday that finally breaks the Democratic primary logjam. Not only is it the first debate since Sanders was hospitalized and the impeachment inquiry began, it also comes as many lower-polling candidates become increasingly desperate to make a mark on the campaign. At a fundraiser in Los Angeles last week, Biden acknowledged how much of the debate is out of any candidate's hands. … Biden said, ‘One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive.’”



Will Buttigieg throw elbows? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg sees a path to the top tier of the Democratic primary field, elbowing his way between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on one side and Joe Biden on the other. At the center of Buttigieg’s push is his health care plan, which the South Bend, Ind., mayor has dubbed ‘Medicare for all who want it.’ The plan would extend a public health insurance option to Americans without ending the private insurance market, an effect of the plan put forward by Sanders and endorsed by Warren. … Buttigieg also argued that his health care plan is tougher on insurance providers than Biden’s own public option proposal to build on Obamacare. ‘It turns out that setting up the exchanges has not been enough to empower all Americans to have good coverage,’ Buttigieg said.”



Beto says he need to ‘break through’ - Texas Tribune: “Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, his campaign announced Friday as he acknowledged it was more urgent than ever to ‘break through’ in the still-crowded primary. The third-quarter total is an improvement over the $3.6 million that the former El Paso congressman took in during the previous quarter, and it came despite a halt to fundraising for roughly two weeks in August after the deadly El Paso shooting. Still, the total puts him behind a majority of primary rivals who have released their third-quarter figures so far, including two leading candidates who each raised around $25 million.”



Bloomberg back to floating trial balloons - CNBC: “Mike Bloomberg might end up running for president, after all. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden’s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That’s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private. Bloomberg has signaled he’s ‘still looking at’ running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run.”



Dems on edge over cyberattacks - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee sent an urgent alert on Monday to every presidential campaign aimed at avoiding a repeat of the cybersecurity fiasco the party suffered at the hands of Russia and Wikileaks in 2016. The subject of the email was ‘Counter-Disinformation Update,’ and it was part of a regular series of communications by DNC Tech, the party’s in-house group responsible for internal security and monitoring the spread of fake news about Democrats. POLITICO obtained the full archive of DNC’s Tech’s missives to the presidential campaigns. They reveal a party struggling to combat the continued onslaught of the twin threats faced by the Democratic Party: cyber penetration from state actors abroad and the spread of disinformation about its top presidential candidates by Donald Trump and his allies at home. … It was a moment, the DNC warned, to be hyper vigilant about fake news.”



Seven years later, Warren changes tune on health care - Politico: “Seven years before Elizabeth Warren said ‘I’m with Bernie on Medicare for All,’ she was campaigning for the Senate and didn’t want to talk about single-payer health care. Running a tough race against Republican incumbent Scott Brown, the first-time candidate repeatedly distanced herself from the idea. … But during her first Senate campaign in 2012, she … dodged the question again and again, according to an analysis of newspaper reports, TV, and interviews with health care reform activists at the time. … Warren's refusal to embrace single-payer during that campaign came four years after she co-wrote an essay that called it the ‘most obvious’ solution to the nation's health care woes — though perhaps ‘politically unacceptable.’ Warren’s remarks in 2012, as well as her more circumspect attitude toward Medicare for All at the beginning of her presidential campaign, has exposed her to criticisms from the left.”



Warren strong in Q Poll, but still lags on electability - Quinnipiac University: “One day before the next Democratic debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden remain locked in a close race for the top spot in the Democratic primary, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 30 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 27 percent.. … However, on the question of electability - which candidate has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump - Biden retains his commanding lead with 48 percent saying he has the best chance, compared to 49 percent in August. While still trailing Biden, Warren has increased her support from 9 percent in August to 21 percent today. No other candidate gets into double digits.”

TIME OUT: TO THE HOLY LAND

Smithsonian: “On April 1483, a German politician named Bernhard von Breydenbach embarked on a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Breydenbach and his companions—among others, Dutch artist Erhard Reuwich—traveled at a leisurely clip, touring destinations including Venice, Corfu, Modon and Rhodes while en route. Two years after his pilgrimage, Breydenbach created an illustrated guide detailing the farflung locales he had visited on his trip. The text, titled Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam, or A Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was an instant sensation, with eleven editions in six languages published between 1486 and 1505. Now, one of the few surviving first editions of Breydenbach’s ‘15th-century bestseller’ is set to go on view at the British Museum… Giulia Bartrum, curator of German prints at the British Museum, [says] that prior to the text’s publication, ‘most of the depictions of places such as Jerusalem or Venice were totally made up.’”

BOLTON CALLED FOUL ON TRUMP-GIULIANI UKRAINE MOVES

Fox News: “Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels where she reportedly raised concerns about a July 10 meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ‘investigation that could implicate Biden and his son.’”



Giuliani got big bucks from indicted Ukrainian - Reuters: “President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday. The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump’s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination. Giuliani said Parnas’ company, Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients ‘reduce and mitigate fraud’, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee’s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.”



Feds dig deeper - WSJ: “Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Rudy Giuliani’s business dealings in Ukraine, including his finances, meetings and work for a city mayor there, according to people familiar with the matter. Investigators also have examined Giuliani’s bank records, according to the people. Witnesses have been questioned about Giuliani since at least August by investigators, who also want to know more about Giuliani’s role in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates, the people said. The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and on Monday said he hadn’t been informed of any investigation. ‘They can look at my Ukraine business all they want,’ he said.”



Dems return from recess more united on impeachment - WaPo: “…Just days after suddenly embracing an impeachment inquiry of President Trump — a moment of seeming political crisis — House leaders sent lawmakers home for their scheduled two-week recess. But as Congress returns to work Tuesday, fears of lost momentum, internal dissension and dissipating interest in impeachment have mostly evaporated among House Democrats, who view the past two weeks as among the most damaging to Trump as they dig in for their constitutional showdown with the president. … But on the central question of whether Trump ought to be investigated for potentially committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of removal from office, Democrats are now largely united: Only seven of 235 House Democrats have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, and the White House position, laid out in a letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and three committee chairmen last week, has hardened the resolve of many Democrats.”

WNEP: “The Steamtown Marathon [in Scranton, Pa.] brings out hundreds of spectators each year to cheer for the runners… For the last 24 years, 90-year-old Marie Rupp has been hosting a water station for the thousands of runners that make their way through the borough. … But this year is different. After a fall, Marie went to live at a rehab facility. It would be the first marathon she would not be out cheering for the runners. That's when her neighbors stepped in. ‘We felt it very important to get her out of there for the day and bring her back to the tradition that she started,’ said Sean Osborne of Archbald. Wrapped in a blanket with a space heater for extra warmth, Marie was on Laurel Street with her neighbors as runners passed by. And while she says she is no longer in charge, her neighbors know she still calls the shots. … ‘It's exciting! It puts life in our bones,’ Marie said.”

BIDENS ACKNOWLEDGE ETHICS WOES

NYT: “Hunter Biden, whose overseas business dealings have drawn relentless attacks from President Trump and posed a threat to the candidacy of his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month, his lawyer said on Sunday, a move his father later lauded in a forceful defense of his son’s integrity. The lawyer also said in a statement that if Mr. Biden were to be elected president, his son would ‘agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.’ The decision is the first action the pro-Biden camp has taken that appears to acknowledge the extent to which Hunter Biden’s business practices have created an untenable problem for his father’s 2020 campaign. With the fourth Democratic primary debate only two days away … Mr. Biden’s lower-polling Democratic rivals have suggested his son’s work overseas raises questions about conflict of interest.”



Rolls out ethics, campaign finance plan in reply - Reuters: “Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden would look to ban private money from federal elections, his campaign said on Monday in a plan for government ethics that doubled as an attack on President Donald Trump. … The former U.S. vice president is promising to match individual donations for elections with government funding, and to block cash from private sources. Biden would also establish a new commission to enforce anti-corruption laws, bar lobbying by foreign governments and require candidates to disclose their tax returns.”



Dems still hedging on Warren - NYT: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience [in Washington] one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren’s guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch… Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case… But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three. … [H]er growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them.”



Trump said to still want Warren - Axios: “President Trump's allies still fear a general election matchup against a banged-up Joe Biden more than a run against an invigorated Elizabeth Warren, people close to the president tell Axios. Warren has surpassed Biden in some primary polls, seemingly helped by the early coverage of Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate conspiracy theories involving Biden and his son Hunter. And a Fox News poll now shows Biden and Warren each would lead Trump, 50% to 40%. … Several advisers in Trumpworld told [Axios] that Warren is arguably a better candidate in terms of being quick on her feet and prepared on a debate stage. But those advisers say her liberal stances on some issues and her ‘likeability’ problem with segments of general election voters make her weaker against Trump than even a Biden hindered by gaffes, generational dissonances and a son with personal drama and a lobbying record.”



Sanders slams Warren as ‘capitalist’ - Fox News: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders … is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a ‘capitalist.’ ‘There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,’ Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s ‘This Week.’ ‘Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.’ The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ‘I am a capitalist to my bones.’ Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ‘will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.’”

History: “[On this day 72 years ago] U.S. Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager becomes the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. Yeager, born in Myra, West Virginia, in 1923, was a combat fighter during World War II and flew 64 missions over Europe. He shot down 13 German planes and was himself shot down over France, but he escaped capture with the assistance of the French Underground. After the war, he was among several volunteers chosen to test-fly the experimental X-1 rocket plane, built by the Bell Aircraft Company to explore the possibility of supersonic flight. … Yeager flew the X-1 over Rogers Dry Lake in Southern California. The X-1 was lifted to an altitude of 25,000 feet by a B-29 aircraft and then released through the bomb bay, rocketing to 40,000 feet and exceeding 662 miles per hour (the sound barrier at that altitude). The rocket plane, nicknamed ‘Glamorous Glennis,’ was designed with thin, unswept wings and a streamlined fuselage modeled after a .50-caliber bullet.”

AMBASSADOR LAYS UKRAINE CLAIMS OFF ON TRUMP

AP: “A U.S. ambassador is expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what President Donald Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony in the impeachment probe. Gordon Sondland, Trump’s hand-picked ambassador to the European Union, is among administration officials being subpoenaed to appear on Capitol Hill this week against the wishes of the White House.”



Former top Russia aide talks, too - Politico: “President Donald Trump’s former top Russia aide arrived on Capitol Hill Monday to testify before House impeachment investigators, as Democrats accelerate efforts to unearth the facts of Rudy Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy with top Ukrainian officials. Democrats view Fiona Hill’s closed-door testimony as critical to their understanding of the extent to which Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, bypassed official U.S. government channels by pressuring Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election.”



Hairy situation: Inside the botched effort to hire Trey Gowdy - NYT: “For 24 hours last week, Trey Gowdy, the former South Carolina congressman best known for leading congressional investigations of Hillary Clinton, was the new face of President Trump’s outside legal defense and a symbol of a streamlined effort to respond to a fast-moving impeachment inquiry. A day later, the arrangement fell apart, with lobbying rules prohibiting Mr. Gowdy from starting until January, possibly after the inquiry is over. Now, according to two people familiar with events, Mr. Gowdy is never expected to join the team. And Trump advisers are back to square one, searching for a different lawyer.”



House impeachment roadmap shaping up - Axios: “Ahead of this week's subpoenas and depositions, new documents obtained by Axios show how Democrats are taking the impeachment inquiry in two tightly focused directions: Ukraine and obstruction of justice. Why it matters: There are new temptations for Democrats to broaden the scope of their inquiry after developments last week including President Trump's gift to Turkey, new questions about coordination with the Chinese over Hunter Biden, and the dramatic airport arrests of two of Rudy Giuliani's associates with Eastern European backgrounds and their indictments on campaign finance violations. But for now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be sticking with her instincts to keep the probe tight and as simple as possible for Americans to understand.”



RNC spends to tweak vulnerable House Dems on impeachment - McClatchy: “Republicans are planning to target Democrats in swing districts with a new round of ads on impeachment this week as lawmakers return from their fall recess. The Republican National Committee will spend $350,000 on a multi-media buy as part of a strategy that includes digital ads, text messages and phone calls starting Tuesday calling on Democratic House members to 'stop the madness.' The effort is primarily targeted at the 31 Democrats in districts President Donald Trump carried in 2016. ‘We’ll emphasize it’s time to move on,’ RNC spokesman Rick Gorka told McClatchy. ‘There are real issues they could be working on, anything but this.’ Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Georgia, who supports an impeachment inquiry, is one of the GOP targets.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Was Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch an Obama appointee or a Trump appointee? If she was a holdover from the Obama years doesn’t make a little bit of sense for Trump to do some housecleaning? From what I understand some Ambassador appointments are given to friends and people who do something (in the campaign) to help the president get into office.” – Mary Blanton, Alpharetta, Ga.



[Ed. note: There are all different kinds of ambassadors, Ms. Blanton. There are two main categories: political appointees and career diplomats. Among the “political” there are two broad groups: Positions of such import that presidents want trusted confidantes and loyalists. Then there are postings to places so safe and stable that they can be doled out to donors and key supporters as patronage plums. The divide on the “career” side is similar. Some are to places of little strategic importance but are so poor and/or remote that fat cats wouldn’t want to perch there. But many are to places where the work is just too sensitive to risk amateurism. Our ambassadors face terrible risks on a regular basis in places around the world where, but do so in service of crucial American goals. We want top people with deep knowledge of the language, culture and history of places like Iraq, Turkey and, yes, Ukraine, to serve in such posts. Yovanovitch is one of these folks. She was appointed to her former post by then-President Obama. But before that, George W. Bush appointed her to the strategically important former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. She started in the Foreign Service in 1986. She’s a lifer. So while it’s true that she was an Obama appointee, it’s probably better to think of her as a product of our Foreign Service system more than anything else.]



“I would love to hear your reaction to the following idea: There should be a law that the federal government cannot tax any citizen at a rate in excess of 33 1/3%. This is to prevent any candidate from getting votes by simply suggesting that they will tax ‘the rich’ at 50%, 60% or 70%. Low income people are apt to vote for those candidates for the wrong reason. What say you?” – Ted Boers, Grand Rapids, Mich.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Boers, but you’d have to quickly come up with a LOT of additional dough. Rich people – the 40 percent of highest earners – pay something like 70 percent of all the taxes. If you knock down the two top tax rates – 37 percent and 35 percent – that would be a lot of money off the table. Leaving aside that practical consideration, there’s this one: You’d really need a constitutional amendment to do what you’re describing. It’s very hard to imagine getting supermajority support for something that would immediately be unpopular with the bottom 60 percent of earners. In the coming fiscal disasters awaiting America, we’re going to have some tough fights over taxes and spending – the very fights lawmakers have been pushing off for decades. It’s going to be ugly and weird and a number of proposals once considered unthinkable will suddenly sound mainstream. Fiscal conservatives would probably do better to get ready for that moment.]



“In quite deservedly praising Cardinal shortstop Paul DeJong you parenthetically asked ‘(whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?).’ Does the name Ernie (Let’s play two) Banks ring a bell? In the four years from 1957 through 1960 when he was the Cubs regular shortstop he hit 176 home runs (yearly average 44), leading the league twice. Over that same period, he drove in 491 runs (yearly average 123), again twice leading the league. He wasn’t just an offensive force, winning a Gold Glove for his defensive play in 1960. Additionally, he was the National League Most Valuable Player in both 1958 and 1959 despite playing for a sorry team that in both years finished fifth in an eight team league. So, to answer your question — I have, as have the many others who undoubtedly have written to point out your egregious error. (I still love you).” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: There’s always a Cubs fan out there! Always! You are quite right, Mr. Foys. Other than to a lesser degree Robin Yount and Derek Jeter, Banks is the cream of the power hitting shortstop crop. I’m including your note for two reasons: 1) Goodness knows Cubs fans need something to be cheerful about in October 2) Maybe this expression of goodwill will help snap the Cardinals out of their slough of despair against the Nats!]

Metro: “A rhino was filmed going for a walkabout in a crowded market. The animal casually strolled past liquor shops and clothes showrooms in Nepal as shocked members of the public looked on. What was probably more surprising is no-one seemed to be scared of the rhino, which had strayed from the popular Chitwan National Park. Some tourists were so comfortable they even took selfies with the large beast on Thursday. Shankar Kandu Ravi, 31, from Uttar Pradesh in India, followed the elusive animal for about ten minutes and then took a picture with it. … Mr. Ravi said the rhino even came face-to-face with a couple but didn’t attack anyone. He added: ‘It was just acting to scare the couple. It warned people to not come close.’ ‘Next morning, I had inquired about it and learnt that it returned to the jungle early in the morning.’”

If Clinton is serious, here's best way for her to defeat the president",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hillary-trump-2020-best-way-defeat-president-doug-schoen,"After months out of the limelight, Hillary Clinton has reentered the public sphere, leading to a great deal of speculation about whether the former Democratic presidential candidate is seriously considering a rematch against President Trump in 2020.

The speculation surrounding whether Clinton would mount another presidential run has even caught the attention of President Trump, who took to Twitter on Wednesday to bash both Clinton and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the current Democratic frontrunner.

“I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,” Trump tweeted. “Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!”

MICHAEL GOODWIN: HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN — OR GET OVER IT ALREADY

“Don’t tempt me. Do your job,” Clinton responded.

Trump and Clinton’s latest Twitter exchange comes just a few weeks after she blasted the president in an interview with CBS, calling him a “corrupt human tornado.”

“I believe that, look there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again. And I'm hoping that both the public and press understand the way Trump plays the game,” Clinton said.

In my view, Clinton entering the 2020 race would do the party an enormous disservice. Further, given that there are still currently 19 Democratic candidates vying for the nomination, Clinton’s ability to re-clinch the nomination is a long shot at best.

However, if the former secretary of state has genuine ambitions to enter the Democratic primary race, the best way she could do so is not by blasting Trump or by being divisive.

Rather, Clinton needs to rise above the field and present a worldview that is unifying, and can bring together the two factions of the Democratic Party.

If Clinton is hoping to break through the deadlocked primary and make another run for the presidency, her best way in would be by presenting big ideas on climate, the economy, health care, and job creation.

Ultimately, the Democratic Party very well may be deadlocked, as nearly 20 candidates are seeking the party’s nomination.

Thus, if Clinton is hoping to break through the deadlocked primary and make another run for the presidency, her best way in would be by presenting big ideas on climate, the economy, health care, and job creation.

While some are arguing that there is a path for Clinton in the 2020 race, support for her third run is mixed, even within her own party.

A Rasmussen poll released this month showed that even though Clinton is running even with President Trump, most Democrats don’t want her to get into the race.

While Trump and Clinton both garner 45 percent of the vote in this hypothetical match-up, 71 percent of all voters don’t think Clinton should run again.

Moreover, 59 percent of Democrats don’t think that Clinton should enter the race for their party’s nomination, compared to 74 percent of independents and 80 percent of Republicans who believe that Clinton should stay out of the 2020 contest.

Ultimately, whether Clinton is seriously weighing another presidential run or is just bashing Trump as a way to promote her book, she is still speaking as one of the most prominent Democratic politicians in the country. Thus, Clinton should not waste her media time and influence on taunting the president.

Rather, Clinton should seize on this moment to contribute to a unifying, inclusive Democratic narrative which entails bold plans for tackling climate change, making the economy work for everyone, and fixing the broken health care system.

To be sure, even when she is out of the running for president, Hillary Clinton is still one of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party today.

However, it remains to be seen whether Clinton will use her power to move the party closer to the White House, or whether she will merely use it to tease the president as he faulters.

Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, tweeted Monday morning that the president “has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.”

The New York Times reported that the video was played during a conference held by American Priority, a pro-Trump group, at Trump National Doral Miami. The event was not hosted by the president or his reelection campaign. A Trump campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, told the paper: “That video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.”

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS ‘CAPITALIST’

The White House Correspondents Association said in a statement it was “horrified” by the video.

“The WHCA is horrified by a video reportedly shown over the weekend at a political conference organized by the president’s supporters at the Trump National Doral in Miami,” said Jonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association and a journalist at ABC News. “All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the president’s political opponents.”

The White House Correspondents Association called on Trump himself to denounce the video.

“We have previously told the president his rhetoric could incite violence,” Karl said. “Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.”

According to the newspaper, the video seems to be an edited scene from a movie called the “Kingsman: The Secret Service.” The edited video shows the president’s head superimposed on a man opening fire inside a church — described in the video as the “Church of Fake News.” Those being shot in the pews have logos of media organizations on them.

The New York Times said a number of the president’s top allies were scheduled to appear at the conference, including his son Donald Trump Jr., former White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The paper said Sanders and Trump Jr. both said they did not see the video.

In an eight-page letter sent last week to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Cipollone wrote: “Your [impeachment] inquiry is constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process. In the history of our Nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the President without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.”

""President Trump and his administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,"" Cipollone added. ""Your unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.""

WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT WILL NOT COMPLY WITH 'ILLEGITIMATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

In order to keep up the facade of outrage and paint Cipollone’s defiant letter as grounds for impeachment in its own right, Democrats have ignored the substance of the letter itself and resort to threatening administration officials who comply with the historical and legally irrefutable principle of executive privilege.

Among other things, Cipollone’s letter takes Democrats to task for calling their stunt an “impeachment inquiry” without passing any kind of impeachment resolution.

Cipollone wrote: “Here, House leadership claims to have initiated the gravest inter-branch conflict contemplated under our Constitution by means of nothing more than a press conference at which the Speaker of the House simply announced an ‘official impeachment inquiry.’ Your contrived process is unprecedented in the history of the Nation and lacks the necessary authorization for a valid impeachment proceeding.”

The refusal of Democrats to follow historical precedent regarding impeachment is not simply a matter of semantics or procedural niceties. Rather, it is a transparent attempt to run an open, one-sided, partisan pillory without granting President Trump the due process rights to which he is clearly constitutionally entitled.

The impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton established that the ground rules required by the Constitution are guaranteed. These right include allow the president’s lawyer to be present at all proceedings and “question any witness called before the Committee.”

It’s telling that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats who vociferously advocated for the rights of the accused in President Clinton’s impeachment proceedings have now hypocritically flipped the script and claim that President Trump has no such rights.

Democrats have used the cover of their press conference-declared “official impeachment inquiry” to deny Republican ranking members on each of the investigating committees their own subpoena powers, which are traditionally guaranteed for the minority party.

Even among those who accept Schiff’s collapsing Ukraine narrative and believe President Trump must be impeached, there’s a growing admission that something is very off about the Bidens’ dealings involving Ukraine.

The Democrats are in effect pretending their refusal to set ground rules creates an “inquiry” where they have unlimited powers of subpoena, with none of the secrecy requirements that justify those powers in a grand jury investigation – the analogy liberal commentators keep drawing. At the same time, the Democrats want no one to be allowed to investigate their own conduct.

Congressional Democrats’ obstinate refusal to accept these basic due process concerns, and their insistence on making Cipollone’s letter into a “constitutional crisis,” highlights Democrats’ underlying uneasiness with the facts of the case and their unwillingness to invite scrutiny of their own behavior.

There seems to be as much to blowback in Democrats’ faces as they have to throw at Trump.

We have seen increasingly shady looking interactions between House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and the CIA leaker – that so-called “whistleblower,” who has reported links to an unnamed Democratic presidential campaign.

We have also seen a renewed focus on former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter and his business dealings in Ukraine.

Even among those who accept Schiff’s collapsing Ukraine narrative and believe President Trump must be impeached, there’s a growing admission that something is very off about the Bidens’ dealings involving Ukraine. There is, as the old saying goes, “a there there.”

But Democrats want to strip Republicans and the president of the procedural safeguards and rights needed to air out all the facts – not just those convenient for the Democrats’ narrative.

Peter Schweizer, a defender of the president, wrote a recent New York Times op-ed headlined “What Hunter Biden Did Was Legal – And That’s the Problem.” Schweizer explains that “Hunter [Biden], a businessman, landed deals he was apparently unqualified to score save for one thing: his father” and that Joe Biden has been transparently dishonest about his discussions with his son about those dealings.

Meanwhile, The Intercept’s Ryan Grim, who supports impeachment, documents decades of “soft corruption” on the part of the Biden clan in a new report. Grim writes: “Democratic voters … can see the corruption in front of their eyes, and they have to decide whether that’s the argument they want to have with Trump in 2020 – or whether they want to nominate someone else who will allow the party to make the corruption argument cleanly.”

For all the talk about the political costs the president is supposedly accruing from his dealings with Ukraine, the only unequivocal loser thus far is Joe Biden. Until Pelosi and Schiff began their impeachment push, Biden was the clear frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. He’s now lost that position to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – and continues to decline.

Biden himself seems to have taken notice of this untoward development. Until Warren overtook him, Biden was by far the most reluctant of the leading Democratic presidential candidates to endorse impeachment. He clearly reasoned it was better to downplay an issue that implicated him and his family.

Only after losing his spot as the Democratic frontrunner to the impeachment-happy Warren – and suffering a downturn in support as Hunter Biden’s activities dominated the headlines – did Joe Biden himself get on the impeachment bandwagon. It may prove to be an ill-fated choice.

As President Trump correctly observed, if Democrats continue to refuse the White House’s and House Republicans’ reasonable demands for basic due process, the legitimacy of their pseudo “impeachment inquiry” will be tried in the court of public opinion. This could have potentially disastrous results for Democrats and for public trust in the integrity of Congress and our presidential elections, which Democrats clearly seek to reverse by illegitimate means such as sham impeachment proceedings.

Here are five questions that need to be asked,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-democrats-debate-five-questions,"When Democrats gather for the CNN-New York Times presidential debate on Tuesday, note there are five big “donkeys” in the room. (They can’t be elephants at a Democratic debate.)

First, the most obvious is that Hunter Biden earned $600,000 a year from a Ukrainian natural gas company. The left-wing media has done all it can to suppress questions about Hunter Biden. They correctly point out he has not been convicted of anything. Of course, given the universal agreement that Ukraine was extraordinarily corrupt (before the recent presidential election of a reformer) what would absence of conviction prove? It is close to President Nixon’s, November 17, 1973 press conference “I am not a crook” assertion.

There are two simple points about the Hunter Biden-Ukraine issue. What was his unique qualification to get that much money, which has added up to more than $3,000,000? Did his father really not know about it? Hunter has said he did tell his father, but his father has said he did not know. Given former Vice President Joe Biden’s routinely faulty memory, both could be true. However, most parents would know if their child was making $600,000 a year from a foreign company.

Second, do the other Democratic presidential candidates support Beto O’Rourke’s proposal to cut off tax deductibility for any church or other religious institution that does not recognize gay marriage? This is a boldly radical idea comparable to O’Rourke’s call for compulsory gun confiscation. How do the other candidates handle their slavish devotion to identity politics when faced with this bold but politically deadly proposal?

Third, since Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is now rated the front runner, how many candidates agree with her position that California’s public school gender indoctrination should be extended to the rest of the country? Because this is a new issue – only now emerging into public conversation – it is worth quoting a question from the recent CNN town hall.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Question: “How do you feel about schools teaching children about gender orientation and gender identity? In California, we're already starting those kinds of teachings and parents have been very upset and outraged. As a parent, I'm in full support of these teachings. How would you feel about it for the rest of the country?”

Warren responded: ""So, I believe this is about teaching children about our world. And, of course, we should teach them about our world. We should teach them about people, we should teach them about differences. So, I strongly support this. And I support doing this in age-appropriate ways from the time they're very young. I think this is part of how children learn, that we live in a world that has a lot of different folks who look different, who sound different, who do different things, who form different kinds of families and as Americans, we look at that and say, it's not our weakness, that's our strength.""

Do the other Democratic candidates agree that teachers' unions can force gender identity indoctrination on children as young as 3-years-old – and that parents have no right to withdraw their children from these compulsory classes? In many ways, this is a bigger assault on religion than O’Rourke’s tax proposal.

Fourth, do the presidential candidates agree with House Democrats, who on Sept. 26 passed the first step toward government health care for people in the country illegally by mandating a whole series of health activities, including electronic health records at the border?

Fifth, do the presidential candidates agree that House Democrats should continue to ignore the fair, open process used in the Nixon and Clinton impeachments? Do they agree that it was OK for Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to totally falsify President Trump’s words in his opening statement at a committee hearing, or do they believe it was unacceptably misleading in something as serious as an impeachment investigation?

These five questions would do a lot to clarify just how out-of-touch Democrats are becoming.

The promotional video also praises AOC for supporting a climate protest outside of then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office in November of 2018.

Project Veritas, whose founder, James O'Keefe, describes himself as a “guerrilla journalist,” built up the release on social media with an “#ExposeCNN” hashtag. The CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate is scheduled to feature 12 leading 2020 hopefuls duking it out from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio -- but the latest batch of alleged undercover recordings could indicate which candidates are preferred by CNN brass.

CNN'S BRIAN STELTER WIDELY RIDICULED AFTER BLAMING TECH ISSUES FOR BIZARRE ANTI-TRUMP SEGMENT

Fox News has not independently verified what Project Veritas says is a clandestine recording of CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker and members of his staff discussing their thoughts on the 2020 presidential race. The network has “already picked its winners and losers,” the Project Veritas narrator says.

“It's incredible that CNN is holding the debate when it's not a neutral referee, it's an advocate for the most-radical leftist policies. The Project Veritas videos are showing CNN for what it has become, the TV headquarters of The Resistance,” Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: ‘IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING’

CNN’s previous Democratic debate, a two-night summer marathon, was criticized by both sides of the aisle. Viewers complained that CNN’s format did not allow articulate answers because of time restrictions and that questions were specifically designed to create tension between candidates. “It was not CNN’s finest hour,” Poynter’s Tom Jones wrote.

CNN hosts Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper are set to moderate the follow-up event on Tuesday, along with New York Times editor Marc Lacey. But the debate comes amid another public relations headache for the network.

A person identified as CNN’s senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez, is claimed to be featured on a recording saying “Joe Biden has a problem, because his son was trading in his name.” Another CNN staffer is claimed to be heard saying the network is less fair to candidates Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar than other 2020 hopefuls.

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

“I think they like Warren a lot,” a person identified as CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra says in the video. “They’re pro-Warren for now.”

Sierra is also claimed to have said, “They don’t like Tulsi Gabbard” and detailed Cooper’s disdain for Trump. “Every day, he’s always like mocking him and stuff.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

The Project Veritas videos feature now-former CNN satellite uplink technician Cary Poarch (he was fired after the first batch of recordings were released), who secretly recorded some of the network’s morning editorial meetings. Poarch said he still considers himself a Democrat but, “spent many sleepless night” pondering the bias within CNN and hope to ensure a “free and fair” election.

“It’s very obvious. It's an unwritten rule that if you are center, center right, or heaven forbid, full-right Republican Trump supporter, then you are not welcome at CNN,” Poarch said in the second installment of videos.

Zucker is also heard pushing coverage of Kamala Harris’ demand for Twitter to suspend President Trump’s account despite admitting it wasn’t actually going to happen.

TRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT 'CNNs OF THE WORLD' AFTER FIERY NEWS CONFERENCE

“It’s not gonna happen, but it’s a good segment in the show, ‘Should Trump’s Twitter account be suspended?,’ It’s obviously what Kamala Harris has… others are talking about it. Not gonna happen, but it’s a good talk, it’s a good segment,” Zucker said.

Monday’s initial release featured recordings made by Poarch capturing Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

“I don’t care about the MSNBC event, OK? I don’t care about them. Let’s just stay very focused on impeachment,” a person identified as Zucker says in the recording on the day of an MSNBC town hall event. “We shouldn’t just pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so all of these moves are toward impeachment.”

Poarch said he decided to wear a hidden camera because of CNN's perceived bias, and said he secretly recorded Zucker’s 9 a.m. rundown conference call because the network was “pumping out propaganda.”

MAINSTREAM MEDIA SHREDS CNN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE: ‘THE CLEAR INTENT WAS TO SPARK FIGHTS’

“I noticed after… that there was a strong group-think that permeated through the halls and that everyone was onboard the ‘I hate Trump Train,” Poarch said.

Poarch said on “Hannity” during an exclusive interview on Monday night that he no longer works for CNN as a result of the secret recording.

Zucker, who began his career at NBC, rose from researcher all the way to president and CEO of NBC Universal. Along the way, he was responsible for increasing Donald Trump’s fame when he greenlighted “The Apprentice.”

Zucker and the president famously have feuded since Trump’s foray into politics, with the president attacking the liberal network on a regular basis and accusing CNN of unfair coverage. CNN has filled its primetime lineup with anti-Trump opinion hosts and the network’s White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, has made a name for himself by quarreling with members of the administration when they are available to the press.

“Its employees have been opposing the president and pushing for his removal so much that it is obvious it's the corporate position of the network,” Gainor said.

Project Veritas, which frames itself as a conservative whistleblower watchdog group, has previously released what it claims to be hidden camera footage of network news producers, federal politicians and members of private political organizations making statements while unaware they were being recorded."

Perhaps this was because my personal reaction on reading the dossier was mild amusement at how very poorly it was written and how absurd the patently “salacious and unverified” allegations sounded.

In the end, what sounded like bogus claims turned out to be bogus claims.

You would think Democrats and their media allies would have learned a lesson from this nonexistent “Russia collusion” debacle. But Democrats have once again unquestioningly accepted hearsay allegations from a politically biased source in the whistleblower complaint.

GOP SEN. KEVIN CRAMER SAYS ATTACKS ON TRUMP WILL NEVER CEASE: 'HATERS ARE GOING TO HATE'

Perhaps strangest of all in this strangest of political times, Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry based on these allegations before even seeing either the complaint itself or a transcript of the call to which it referred.

Though I rarely agree with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on policy, I don’t think she’s stupid. So I was puzzled by her willingness to pursue this extremely risky step without anything approaching evidence of serious wrongdoing.

I thought perhaps a combination of the pending election, the weak slate of potential Democratic presidential nominees, plus President Trump’s increasingly obvious economic success, had created political desperation so intense that Pelosi’s only choice was to take an extreme political risk.

At this point, I asked myself, what else have they got? Elizabeth Warren? A Hillary Clinton rematch? Seriously?

But then it occurred to me that this could all make sense. People tend to believe that others will do what they themselves would do if faced with similar choices. No one wants to believe other people would make choices morally superior to their own.

This certainly explains the rush to accept the Steele dossier’s absurd claims. According to The New York Times: “Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and the D.N.C. by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates – including possible connections with Russia. It was at that point that Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele, who has deep sourcing in Russia, to gather information.”

Whether you call this opposition research (meaning Democrats did it) or collusion (meaning Republicans did it), it’s certainly easy to see why Democrats incorrectly believed nominee Trump would look to Russia for information that could influence the election. It was the very conduct in which the Democrats had engaged.

How about the whistleblower’s complaint? Well, again according to The New York Times, former Vice President Joe Biden “threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine’s leaders did not dismiss the country’s top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption.” Not coincidentally, the prosecutor “was soon voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament.”

So did anyone associated with Biden benefit from his actions? Well, Mr. Biden’s son Hunter “had a stake in the outcome” as he was “paid as much as $50,000 per month” for being “on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.”

Whether you call this fighting corruption (meaning a Democrat did it) or an abuse of power (meaning a Republican did it), it’s once again easy to see why Democrats would so easily believe that President Trump threatened to withhold foreign aid to obtain a personal benefit. It’s exactly what Democrats did under similar circumstances.

Less than one day after Pelosi announced her impeachment inquiry, President Trump discredited the whistleblower’s allegations by releasing a rough transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The rough transcript shows that Trump did not condition foreign aid on any action by Zelensky. Zelensky has since confirmed that he didn’t feel any such pressure from Trump.

The transcript also shows that Zelensky, not Trump, brought up Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani visiting Ukraine to investigate corruption. And despite incredibly biased media coverage to the contrary, the only “favor” Trump requested in the call concerned investigating foreign interference in our 2016 election – a subject that used to be of great interest to Democrats.

In reality, if someone suggested withholding aid to pressure a foreign power into besmirching a political opponent, President Trump would be the first person in the room to say “No way” – or likely something far more graphic and inappropriate to repeat here.

But much like the false “Russiagate” debacle, because of their willingness to believe President Trump would act as they would in similar circumstances, the Democrats (and their media allies) now find themselves prematurely committed to an impeachment inquiry based on the flimsiest of justifications.

I fully expect their hollow abuse of power claims to continue. They have no choice at this point. They will continue to stir up a lot of dust and when the dust settles, once again, there will be nothing there.

Bolton told aide to alert National Security Council lawyer after meeting with Ukrainians about investigations: impeachment testimony

Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers investigating possible impeachment charges against President Trump on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. The meeting in question took place July 10, a little more than two weeks before President Trump's controversial call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Both Bolton and Hill, who were present at the meeting, had concerns about the conversation, she testified.

Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ""investigation that could implicate Biden and his son."" Click here for more on our top story.

In addition, Hill had high praise for ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Yovanovitch, who herself testified before congressional lawmakers last Friday as part of the impeachment inquiry, was recalled from her ambassadorship in May by Trump, around the same time that Rudy Giuliani — Trump's personal attorney — pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with the board of a gas company there.

Democratic dozen at fourth presidential primary debate will be a record-breaker

A really big stage is set the fourth round of Democrats' presidential primary debate Tuesday night. Twelve candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria. That means the showdown tonight will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention. The debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The Democratic National Committee's media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times. All eyes will be on Bernie Sanders, who just two weeks ago was rushed to the hospital when he suffered a heart attack.

Trump imposes sanctions on Turkey, threatens more severe penalties, to stop invasion into Syria

President Trump on Monday authorized sanctions and raised steel tariffs on Turkey and threatened more severe financial penalties if Ankara continued its military offensive in northern Syria launched the president decided to withdraw U.S. troops from the region more than a week ago. Trump also urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to negotiate a peaceful end to the violence is sending Vice President Mike Pence and White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien to lead a delegation to Turkey to seek a resolution to the conflict.

In addition, the president announced, U.S. troops in northeastern Syria will be withdrawn from the country as planned and redeployed “in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014,” when the Islamic State made major territorial gains.

Trump mulls idea of lawsuit against CNN over recording of network 'bias'

President Trump on Monday floated a lawsuit threat against CNN over reports that the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, launched an internal bias campaign to undermine his presidency. In a tweet posted Monday evening, Trump said, “’Project Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zucker’s (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNN’s BIAS!’ @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?”

The president’s latest gripe with CNN comes after conservative activist group Project Veritas published undercover recordings from an alleged “whistleblower” that capture CNN employees casually confirming the network's anti-Trump bias and show Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James said Monday that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey was “misinformed” when he posted a tweet that kicked off a costly dispute between the NBA and its Chinese fans and sponsors. “I’m not here to judge how the league handled the situation. I just think that when you’re misinformed or you’re not educated about something – and I’m just talking about the tweet itself – you never know the ramifications that can happen,” James told reporters on Monday night back in Los Angeles.

Guy Benson: We'll get to our guests in a moment. Coming up later in this hour Congressman Adam Kinzinger will join me as well. Guy Benson show dot.com is our Web site please subscribe to the podcast if you'd like. That's Guy Benson show dot.com. We begin this hour with Senator Rand Paul a Republican of Kentucky. He has a brand new book out the case against socialism. Senator good to have you back.

Sen. Rand Paul: Glad to be with you Guy.

Sen. Rand Paul: So before we get to the book and we'll definitely delve into that I just want to ask you about your reaction. There was a statement out from the White House today from the president announcing new sanctions against Turkey the redeployment of American troops in the region to monitor what's happening in Syria and to as the president says prevent a repeat of 2014 if ISIS were to reconstitute. Do you favor these sanctions do you favor having troops in the area to possibly intervene if necessary.

Sen. Rand Paul: You know I think our founding fathers were very prescient when they assigned the role of deciding when we go to war to Congress. And so it's sort of a separation of powers issue that has gotten lost over time. But our founding fathers were very clear. You know Madison said that the executive branch is most prone to war. Therefore we delegated that power. You know we vested that power in the branch the legislative branch because they were fearful of having a president that was too powerful and too much war. And so really if people want to be at war in Syria there needs to be a big debate in Congress and that's how you determine whether something's in in one's national interest. People throw that term around loosely and say well it's in our national interest to be in Syria. And like most Americans are scratching their heads saying really to be in the middle of a five sided complicated war where some of these people been fighting more than a hundred years some of these few have been fighting a thousand years where the way we determine whether we should be there is we have a big spirited debate in Congress and the legislature decides whether we should be at war. The problem with Syria is if we had that debate I don't think anybody up here knows who would be at war with or are going to be at war with Turkey our NATO ally Turkey is allied with a Free Syrian Army which was also our ally for seven years but they're now fighting with Turkey. You've got Assad on the other side and the Russians and the Iranians and you've got the Kurds somehow in the middle. And I think one of the ironic things that you've already seen within the first 48 hours here is the Kurds are now appealing to Assad for protection. And it really is probably the best chance of the Syrian Kurds to ever have any autonomy within Syria is probably having the protection of Syrians and having an intact border between Syria and Turkey. So I think we'll see what happens but I'm very hopeful actually that the new twists and turns will lead to a negotiated settlement. I think what's prevented a negotiated settlement previously has been that the neocons and the people who want to stay everywhere forever have insisted that Assad go that we have regime change in Syria and that insistence has meant that Syria and Assad can't be any part of a negotiated settlement. So you can't have a negotiated settlement if you don't have two parties to it.

Guy Benson: OK. And look I understand your point about the separation of powers in your view of presidential power and war powers what the Constitution says but sanctions for example against Turkey. That's something that is being openly discussed and will be debated in Congress. If there were a significant sanctions package against Turkey based on what they are doing on the ground in Syria is that something that you would be willing to support if it's debated and passed through Congress. You mentioned Turkey as a NATO ally. Do you consider them an ally at this point.

Sen. Rand Paul: I consider them sort of a frenemy. I don't think they've been a great ally and I'm not big on sort of this forever commitment to everybody that's in NATO. That's why I haven't wanted to keep adding people to NATO. So no I don't think they I don't think Turkey's been a good ally in recent times. I think their purchase of Russian missiles should exclude them from any of our weapons. And so there are different ways you can try to use our leverage over Turkey to try to get them to behave in a way that is consistent with them being an ally. But the first step I think would be without question withholding weapons and I've been for withholding weapons from Turkey simply because of their purchase of the Russian missiles. This is an additional reason why I withhold weapons. I separate withholding weapons from sanctions for a couple of reasons. I think sanctions work a little more indiscriminately on the on the population of Turkey and often can turn the population of a country against America whereas withholding holding arms then really hurt anybody in Turkey. It just prevents Turkey from doing things ultimately with those arms that we disapprove of. I would have done the same with Saudi Arabia. I greatly object to the crown prince and I would have withheld arms until we got better behavior out of Saudi Arabia. But I wouldn't vote or wouldn't actually really not prefer any way. Sanctions against Saudi Arabia because I think really trade and continuing of trade unless you're at war with somebody is probably the better part of valor.

Guy Benson: Last question on this subject. And it goes to I think one of the arguments that non interventionists make and the president has made this argument as well and I think it appeals to a lot of voters which is we shouldn't be embroiled in these complicated conflicts where our interests are muddy at best. And I understand boots on the ground by the many thousands in a place like Syria is going to have a lot of detractors here in America I'm skeptical of it myself. But when you look at the Kurds these are the type of people that a lot of non interventionists say that's that's what we need people in that region taking care of their own dirty work in this case fighting and taking many casualties against ISIS with our support if we support people and they they die by the thousands fighting ISIS which I think is definitely in the U.S. broader interest isn't it. Isn't it a problem if we then abandon those people forcing them into the arms of Assad and Russia.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well see I'm not so necessarily sure that it's going to be a bad thing that they will be with Assad. I think it's actually their best time and the chance for actually having a homeland unless the U.S. is going to send 10 20 30 40 50 thousand troops over there to create a homeland form and guard them against everybody from around there. So no I don't think it is in their best interests but my obligations to the Constitution and I think it's complicated in the sense that people think go Kurds or Kurds well they're Turkish Kurds who are Iraqi Kurds and are Syrian Kurds. They don't necessarily all like each other. They have different political parties. The Syrian Kurds primary political arm is socialist and has been terrorist within Turkey and they do want part of Turkey they want part of Turkey to be split off into a Greater Kurdistan and Turkey objects to that. They've been fighting over this issue for 50 60 70 maybe even 100 years. So I think we have to look at it that way and decide. But also I think we have to ask what is the best chance for the Kurds. People have written these ridiculous things saying oh the Kurds have been fighting our war for us what a bunch of hogwash. The Kurds have been fighting for their villages and for their towns and for their women and for their families. And we help them but that doesn't mean that we said oh yeah we've been helping you fight against these terrible people ISIS What Should Be thank you not oh we're now so mad that you're not going to stay forever and create a country for us. President Trump said that he would help the Kurds with ISIS to defeat ISIS. We did. And so really the answer should be not oh yo you ungrateful people you won't help us forever it should be thank you so much for helping us kill these awful people we now control these villages but we're in the middle of a country that we're going to have to deal with. And I don't think the Kurds are physically able nor are we ever going to carve out a region of Syria and say This is yours. But there is a semi-autonomous area within Iraq that is working that should be the model. I think if they work with the host government which is Assad for better or worse the war is over people then go. What are we going to do keep battling on. And what would we have done if Lindsey Graham and Hillary Clinton had gotten their way and the Sunni extremists had won in Syria would we be better off. No I think they would have been a calamity for al-Qaeda and al Nusra to win the war. Assad is a bad guy but I think Al Nusra was worse.

Guy Benson: Yeah I mean and that's certainly debatable. I mean one of my biggest concerns is about ISIS. Some of these guys high value guys escaping and reconstituting and at some point posing enough of the threat where America feels like Okay now we have to go back in. But Senator we'll put a pin in that discussion because it's ongoing I want to talk about your book The Case against socialism it's brand new. You had a bit of let's say an eventful appearance on The View this week. I'll play briefly cut 24. This was an argument that Ana Navarro made about socialism and Venezuela. Listen. Well if you vote for a socialist you might get socialism.

Video Clip: Come on. Don't do that.

Guy Benson: And then she says Maduro is not a socialist. He's a corrupt murderous thug who is starving his people. Just if you would Senator. This came as news to me that Maduro isn't a socialist of course he's a socialist and when socialism often is fully implemented you get messy bloody ugliness throughout history all over the world. But what about maybe a kernel of truth in her argument which is there are forms of maybe social democracy that I oppose but are not the type of corrupt violent socialism that we see in a place like Venezuela that some of the American socialists would aspire towards as opposed to the disaster in Caracas.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well we certainly get to that. But her first point is about Venezuela. She's saying Maduro is a thug and a murderer but not a socialist and my response had she let me speak was that. Can't you be both. Can't you be both a socialist and a thug and it's even more than that. One of the themes of our book The Case against socialism is that perhaps it's not just an accident that you get violence and accident that you get thuggery. Maybe it's an inevitability that if you try to completely socialize things if you tried to appropriate the property or the farms and the businesses that ultimately you can't really do that with a kinder gentler dictator. It takes a ruthlessness if you really want to have full and complete socialism. It does take that ruthlessness. You're right. They look at Scandinavia and they say oh well what about democratic socialism in Scandinavia. Well they've got it all wrong. Scandinavia is not socialist in fact the prime minister of Denmark said to Bernie Sanders Pipe down you know we're not socialist you're you're bad for business we don't want the world to think we are socialist. And when you look closely at Scandinavia which my wife and I did in this book what you actually find is they are a welfare state with a lot of so-called free stuff sort of the freebies of socialism. But the interesting thing is what what Bernie Sanders says is a big lie. He says the rich will pay for all of these things if we bring it to America in Scandinavia. The working class pay a 25 percent sales tax and the middle class pays 60 percent income tax. So the dirty little truth about sort of big welfare states.

Guy Benson: Say that again is the middle class pays 60 60 percent income tax.

Sen. Rand Paul: 60 percent income tax starting at around sixty thousand in Scandinavia. So you have these enormous taxes on the middle class and a 25 percent tax on everyone. But that's you know when you talk about a burden as far as your income the poor and the working class paying a 25 percent sales tax is a big burden for the poor. So you can have the so-called welfare state of Scandinavia. It's not socialism but you can have that big welfare state but you cannot have it by just taxing the rich. That is the big lie Bernie and AOC is they say oh we're going to tax the rich. There's only a few of them anyway. They don't have any votes. You know nobody will care. And this is a demagoguery that we have to expose because in reality Scandinavian welfare ism is supported by massive taxes on the working class and the middle class.

Guy Benson: And would that be your criticism of Elizabeth Warren as well because she's trying to distance herself from Bernie saying I'm not a socialist. Into my bones on the capitalists but a lot of her policies look awfully similar to Bernie's.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well she's more Medicare for All which basically would cost 60 trillion dollars. Where's the money going to come from. Some reporters have begun asking her are you going to tax the middle class. Bernie at least admits that he's going have to tax somebody but you'll save a lot of money on the free insurance. Elizabeth Warren has been unwilling to answer the question but it is an important question where's the 60 trillion coming from with Bernie and I see the problem is they say they're going to tax people but what they propose for taxes is not nearly enough to pay for their you know their dreams of this paradise. They want to create.

Guy Benson: Less than a minute to go. Let me pick up on Medicare for All or single payer health care from your perspective as a medical doctor what's the moral case not just the what will it cost price tag issue what's the moral case in your eyes as a doctor against government run health care.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well leads to shortages it leads to terrible quality and leads to doctors you know selling meat out of the back of an ambulance. We tell that story in our book The Case against socialism. So it just doesn't work practically. But it's also this idea that Bernie seems to put out there that somehow he has a right to a doctor services or a nurse's services and that really is an immoral notion to believe that anyone has the right to someone else's labor.

Guy Benson: Senator Rand Paul a Republican from Kentucky. His new book just out the case against socialism Senator thank you. Thank you. We will step aside and be right back as the guy Benson show continues."

While there are some legitimate concerns that can be raised about Medicare-for-All on the merits—as opposed to on the politics—I am not convinced that it’s a problem that some people, like members of organized labor, have worked hard to negotiate good private health care plans. To me, this is a bit like arguing that we don’t need to eliminate Lyme disease because we can treat it with antibiotics. There is simply no value-added by having a profit or commercial basis to health insurance. If it is to exist at all, it should be strictly as a supplemental product.

But that’s an ideological opinion of mine and not a strategic analysis of what the Democrats should be pursuing on the health care front during the 2020 campaign. Watching the CNN debate on Tuesday night, I agreed with Warren and Sanders on the merits, but I thought the moderates had the better argument.

I have three concerns about pushing for Medicare-for-All right now. The first is that it’s obviously controversial and has big political vulnerabilities. Sanders freely admits that to pay for it will require taxes to go up on everybody who pays taxes, including the middle class. Warren is more reluctant to acknowledge this, although she doesn’t outright deny it. What they both argue, instead, is that overall costs will go down for the middle class because they will no longer have to pay premiums, co-pays, or out-of-pocket costs. This is most likely true in a general sense, although on an individual basis it might depend on how much health care someone uses in a given year. So, one problem lies in convincing people that a tax hike will benefit them, especially when it is not guaranteed that it will.

Another problem is the same one we see anytime health care reforms are proposed. People freak out about losing plans or access to doctors they like or having to wait in a queue to get treatment. This vulnerability isn’t avoidable or a good argument for not pursuing reforms but it does make it risky to propose something as disruptive as the abolishment of all private insurance. For me, this means that you should never propose something like this unless you’re serious about putting all your muscle behind it. And that gets to my third concern.

There is a basic cost-benefit error here. The chances of pushing a Medicare-for-All plan through the next Congress are almost nil. The Democrats would either have to overcome a Senate filibuster or they’d have to eliminate the legislative filibuster altogether. Let’s examine both of those scenarios.

The Democrats would need 60 votes to end a filibuster and they couldn’t get that many votes even if they won every competitive or semi-competitive Senate race next year. So, we can rule this out.

To end the legislative filibuster, they’d need 50 votes and the vice-president breaking a tie. But the Democrats will be lucky to have more than 51 or 52 seats even in a total landslide election. The problem here is that they’re unlikely to have enough unanimity in their caucus to end the legislative filibuster unless they can get closer to 55-57 seats. That’s both because senators are institutionally opposed to the change and because moderates get two valuable things out of the filibuster. First, it prevents radical legislation from passing which would endanger their political careers. Second, it puts them in the strongest negotiating position because they are the ones who can cut deals with Republicans (or so they like to think).

So, it’s not likely that the legislative filibuster will be eliminated by the next Congress. If it is, it will probably be after the first and most important year when even the moderates have to acknowledge that the rule is crippling their new president.

So, on a cost-benefit basis, there are easily identifiable downsides to proposing something that makes people apprehensive and that can be easily attacked and mischaracterized. What I can’t find is the upside. Where is the benefit in proposing something you won’t be able to enact?

And it’s not just the filibuster that makes it hard to enact. It’s also the lack of unanimity about it in the Democratic caucuses. I’m not at all certain that Nancy Pelosi could pass Medicare-for-All through the House. In the Senate, there could be a dozen or more Democratic senators who would never sign off on it. If the idea is to move the Overton Window to make Medicare-for-All more popular, that’s the job of a message candidate, not a candidate who plans on being the nominee.

This lack of unanimity was definitely on display during the debate last night when candidates like Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar all attacked Warren for proposing Medicare-for-All. That footage will be manna from heaven for Donald Trump or whoever runs in his stead next year. We can be angry about Democrats echoing Republican talking points, undermining support for Medicare-for-All, prattling about budget deficits, and giving ammunition to the GOP for the 2020 campaign. But we can also be angry that we have serious potential nominees who couldn’t predict these problems and avoid them.

What’s particularly annoying is that if Sanders or Warren were to become president, they’d probably struggle to pass the plans proposed by Biden and Buttigieg and be accused of Leninism for even trying. That’s the best they could hope to do, and they’d be exceeding my expectations if they succeeded. So, all this is is a big fat political weakness that has no discernible upside at all.

And I simply can’t understand why anyone would gift a person like Donald Trump something he can grab and beat them with. It’s dumb politics and for once the moderates have the better side of an argument."

* There was a lively Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio, last night. The next gathering will be in Georgia on Nov. 20.

* Bernie Sanders hasn’t picked up many congressional endorsements for his presidential campaign, but he’s now picking up two fairly high-profile backers: first-year Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

* Joe Biden’s campaign appears to have a rather serious financial problem: as the 2020 race enters the next stage, the former vice president only had about $9 million cash on hand as of two weeks ago. In contrast, Bernie Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank, Elizabeth Warren had $25.7 million, Pete Buttigieg had $23.3 million, and Kamala Harris had $10.5 million.

* With only three weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) tied with state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), with each garnering 46% support.

* On a related note, Bevin’s fate is reportedly of keen interest to the White House, and Team Trump is reportedly “planning an 11th-hour push to stave off an embarrassing defeat” for the far-right governor.

* And speaking of the Bluegrass State, a judge yesterday sided with the Kentucky Democratic Party and ordered State Board of Elections to keep 175,000 purged voters on the state’s voter rolls.

* In Maine., the latest survey from Public Policy Polling found Sen. Susan Collins (R) trailing a generic Democrat in next year’s U.S. Senate race, 41% to 44%. The incumbent Republican hasn’t yet officially declared whether she’ll run for another term.

* In a newly released audio recording, Texas state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) is heard telling a far-right activist that Donald Trump is “killing” the party “in the urban-suburban districts.”

* And though the president’s GOP primary rivals stand no realistic chance of success, it seemed notable that a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll found former Gov. Bill Weld with 14% support in New Hampshire, up from 3% in the same poll last month."

* The latest national Quinnipiac poll found Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, 30% to 27%. Bernie Sanders is third with 11% – down six points since the last Quinnipiac survey – while Pete Buttigieg was fourth with 8%. Kamala Harris, who had 4% support in the poll, was the only other candidate above 2%.

* Brad Parscale, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, yesterday described the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry as being “a seditious conspiracy to overthrow the people’s president.” He added that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is “attempting to overthrow our great Republic.” Parscale did not appear to be kidding.

* The New York Times published quite a report on the planned voter purge in Ohio’s Republican-led state government: “When Ohio released a list of people it planned to strike from its voting rolls, around 40,000 people shouldn’t have been on it. The state only found out because of volunteer sleuthing.” In all, Ohio intended to purge 235,000 Americans from the state voter rolls, and roughly one-in-five voters on the purge list weren’t supposed to be there.

* Presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke has now “clarified” his position on stripping the tax-exempt status of houses of worship that oppose marriage equality: “O’Rourke and his staff have since said that was not his intended position.”

* Oregon Gov. Kate Brown’s (D) detractors tried to launch a recall campaign against her, but as of yesterday, they failed to collect the necessary number of signatures.

* In Louisiana over the weekend, voters handed Republicans significant state legislative gains, which will likely cause headaches for Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) if he wins a gubernatorial runoff next month.

* And in southern California, things got a little worse for Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. (R) yesterday when the indicted congressman failed to receive an endorsement from the San Diego Republican Party."

Opioid distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson all surged in early Wednesday trading after The Wall Street Journal reported the companies are in talks to settle state and local lawsuits blaming them for the US drug epidemic.

AmerisourceBergen and McKesson traded roughly 7% higher early Wednesday. Cardinal Health traded as much as 8% higher.

The three companies are looking to settle the litigation with a collective $18 billion payment over 18 years, sources told WSJ. The settlement would serve as a sweeping resolution to a collection of lawsuits and keep the drugmakers from bankruptcy.

OxyContin producer Purdue Pharma was forced to file for bankruptcy in mid-September to pay a settlement valued between $10 billion and $12 billion.

The news follows Johnson & Johnson settling two Ohio opioid lawsuits for $20.4 million on October 1. The deal allows the pharmaceutical giant to skip an upcoming federal trial looking to hold health care firms accountable for the epidemic.

AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson are all scheduled to join the federal trial in Ohio Monday. The case is set to serve as a critical precedent in other lawsuits against opioid producers and distributors.

Opioids contributed to more than 400,000 overdose fatalities in the US from 1999 to 2017, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2017 alone, with 68% of the fatalities involving prescription or illicit opioids.

WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME, ELIZABETH WARREN

WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose steady stream of plans have propelled her to the top of the Democratic presidential field, came under sustained attack for the first time during a raucous primary debate here Tuesday that revealed Democrats’ ongoing public struggle to define their beliefs and choose a standard-bearer to take on President Trump. Warren (Mass.) faced direct challenges from several of the 11 other candidates onstage, who took her on over her policies, her fitness to serve as commander in chief and her willingness to question the motives of Democrats who support less transformational ideas. … The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday’s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. Former vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing… Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble.”



Klobuchar, Buttigieg shone through - National Review: “The October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise, in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up, smelled the coffee, and brought their A-games: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls, this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate. But in a way-too-long, often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment, Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out.”



Sanders and Warren have deep pockets as Biden burns cash - AP: “Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don’t just lead the Democratic presidential primary in fundraising. They’ve stockpiled millions more than their rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who burned through money at a fast clip over the past three months while posting an anemic fundraising haul. Sanders held $33.7 million cash on hand on his third-quarter fundraising report. Warren had $25.7 million during the same period, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg came next $23.3 million. Biden, meanwhile, held just $8.9 million, a small fraction of what his leading rivals have at their disposal. With the first votes of the Democratic contest just months away, the candidates are entering a critical and expensive period when having an ample supply of cash can make or break a campaign. Biden’s total raises questions about his durability as a front-runner.”



Squad to endorse Sanders - Fox News: “Three members of the so-called ‘Squad’ of far-left freshman members of Congress are lining up behind Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a ‘Bernie’s Back’ rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed. In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. … The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren…”



Steyer spending stupendous - WSJ: “Billionaire Tom Steyer appeared on the Democratic presidential debate stage for the first time Tuesday night, but voters in early states have already seen him on TV thousands of times. Mr. Steyer, who new federal filings show has poured nearly $48 million of his own money into his long-shot bid, is dominating television screens in the first four states that will hold nominating contests early next year. Since entering the race in July, Mr. Steyer has spent more than $26 million on TV ads, airing more than 53,000 spots in markets that reach Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. All told, that is more than six times as many as the rest of the Democratic field combined.”

TIME OUT: AN INVENTOR’S SLAP SHOT

Smithsonian: “Invented by Frank Zamboni, the eponymous ice-clearing machine celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. He applied for his first U.S. patent in 1949, for this innovative idea that totally transformed winter sports by giving chopped-up ice surfaces a fresh-frozen smoothness in a matter of minutes. ‘At the time, he was just trying to address a need of his,’ says Frank Zamboni, the inventor’s grandson and now president of the Zamboni Company. ‘He saw a need for the ice rink he owned with his brother and cousins… Instead of taking 1 1/2 hours to clean the ice, that was time somebody could be paying to skate on it.’ Contrary to popular belief, the Zamboni machine was not invented in Canada—the place of snow and ice—but in Southern California—the land of sun and fun. … As time went on, he saw a need to quickly clean the ice, so he started improvising with war-surplus equipment.”

PELOSI STILL NOT BITING ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders will hold off on a full House vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be ‘reassessed at some point.’ The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. Trump, White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. But Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son — potentially at the risk of losing U.S. military aid.”



Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Gallup: “Public opinion on whether Trump should be impeached remains mixed, but Americans now lean slightly more in favor of impeachment and removal from office compared with where they stood in June. Currently, 52% say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46% say he should not be. This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller's investigation.”



Staffers fear White House seeking scapegoat on Ukraine call - NYT: “President Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it. Even as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials’ actions around Mr. Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower’s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power. The lawyers’ inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.”



Mulvaney emerges as key figure in impeachment probe - WaPo: “In late May, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting that stripped control of the country’s relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department. Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kiev to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump. The work of those ‘three amigos,’ as they came to call themselves — diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary Rick Perry — has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing before an impeachment inquiry in Congress.”



BEVIN RECOVERS IN KENTUCKY POLL

WYMT: “The Mason-Dixon Kentucky Poll was released early Wednesday morning, and the results are interesting. The poll shows that statewide, 46 percent of likely voters support Republican Governor Matt Bevin, while 46 percent back Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48 percent-40 percent lead over Bevin, but the incumbent has pulled into a tie with his challenger. One percent of respondents voted for Libertarian nominee John Hicks, while seven percent were undecided. The poll also shows Bevin's GOP support grew from 67 percent in December to 77 percent. He is pulling in 22 percent of Democrat respondents for the cross-over vote, while Beshear is drawing 15 percent from Republicans. Among the Mason-Dixon poll participants, Bevin led among men, older voters and rural voters. … The poll credits some of Bevin's resurgence to President Donald Trump's popularity in Kentucky and resistance to his impeachment.”



Second debate was heavy with personal attacks - Louisville Courier Journal: “Republican incumbent Matt Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear had their ugliest public exchange Tuesday at the second gubernatorial debate of the fall campaign. Throughout the discussion, hosted before a raucous crowd of supporters on the University of Kentucky campus, the two rivals called each other liars and regularly interrupted one another as they were peppered with policy questions. When moderators asked about ways they would encourage students to pursue a career in public education, including the state's colleges and universities, the conversation took a turn into the gutter. … The high stakes debate touched on health care, pension reform, medical marijuana and supporting out-of-work coal miners. But it underscored how Kentucky's race for governor this year is defined by Bevin and Beshear's enmity as much as their deep differences on tackling the state's woes.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If Trump is impeached and the Senate is mad at him, votes him out, then the GOP could have a primary too. That would take up a lot of news from the Democrats. I think we need a law for 6 months of elections, period.” – Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.



[Ed. note: It would be a comfort to have such constraints, it’s true. But our Constitution just wouldn’t allow for it. The government can’t tell people when they can talk about issues, therefore there’s no way to keep candidates from campaigning and reporters from reporting. I’m increasingly in favor, though, of doing away with primary elections. Our 40-year experiment with them has been a miserable bust and has unnecessarily prolonged our election calendars. Bring back conventions and spare the American people!]



“I have pretty much come to the opinion that two things will happen…one, the 2020 election is not going to be over on election night (owing to huge court battles to follow many very close races) and…two, at some point our Agitator-in-Chief is going to leave office of his own volition…having become tired of the battle and wanting to go back to his business dealings and such. What say youse (that’s a Michigan (born & raised there) UP term)?” – Rick Randell, Bradenton, Fla.



[Ed. note: I say that I know better not to say, Mr. Randell! I think there are lots of potential scenarios for 2020 that could still be in the offing. We may yet see a landslide or even, dare I say, a political realignment. As for Trump leaving early, it’s pretty hard for me to fathom. I doubt he’d give his enemies the pleasure.]



“I miss Chris’ input during events like the debates on Twitter. I understand why he left, and it is best for his happiness. But there were so many Whhhooo Doogie moments last night, I would have loved watching it with him. But since I have found Fox Nation I can see his more candid takes on the events of the day. I just cannot interact with my clever comments! I would love to have him join The Dispatch so he could participate in the discussion groups. I will send them a note to suggest his inclusion! Thank you for being so glorious. (Sorry about the Cardinals, but Charles is happy!)” – Polly Barrett, Waco, Texas

SLÁINTE, MR. BRADLEY

HuffPo: “A man in Dublin, Ireland, decided to inject a little humor into his funeral Saturday by playing a prank on his loved ones. Shay Bradley, a Defense Forces veteran who died Oct. 8 ‘after a long illness bravely borne’ according to his obituary, shocked then delighted funeralgoers when they suddenly heard his voice shouting from his coffin as it was being lowered into the ground. ‘Hello? Hello. Hello? Let me out!’ stunned attendees heard in a prerecorded message that also included ‘knocking’ against the coffin’s lid. … Those at the funeral can be seen giggling and wiping away tears as Bradley’s voice begins to sing: ‘Hello again, hello. Hello, I just called to say goodbye.’ His daughter Andrea Bradley told HuffPost that her father recorded the audio about a year ago — and that no one really knew about it other than her brother Jonathan and her nephew, Ben. Two days before Shay Bradley’s funeral, Jonathan Bradley decided to tell his mom and the rest of his siblings about the prank. He told them that playing the audio at the funeral was his dad’s dying wish.”

“My non-baseball friends are forever puzzled by my devotion to the game. I agree entirely with them about the irrationality of fandom. … It’s ridiculous. Yet when the hometown Washington Nationals win, my mood brightens. Can’t help it.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on April 21, 2016.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., urged Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to reconsider her opinion that Twitter shouldn't ban the president from its platform.

Harris previously sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in which she listed a series of problems she had with the president's Twitter activity. When asked about the idea, Warren laughed it off and flatly rejected it at the beginning of October.

Harris apparently saw that and referenced her answer during Tuesday's Democratic debate. ""I would urge you to join me,"" she said before claiming that Trump used Twitter to ""obstruct justice.""

Harris also pointed to August's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, claiming the perpetrator was ""informed"" by how Trump used the platform.

WARREN LAUGHS OFF SUGGESTION THAT TWITTER BAN AFTER TRUMP AFTER HARRIS' CALL FOR SUSPENSION

""This is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site,"" she said. ""It is a matter of safety.""

Warren seemed to agree Trump should leave Twitter but didn't explicitly endorse his suspension. ""So look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job,"" she said.

When Harris pressed Warren on joining her call to suspend Trump, Warren shook her head and said ""no."" Harris, apparently surprised, smiled and said ""wow.""

Harris ignited a Twitter controversy in October after she alerted Dorsey to one of Trump's tweets. At that point, she had already sent her letter in which she told the company: ""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.""

KAMALA HARRIS DOUBLES DOWN ON SUSPENDING TRUMP ON TWITTER, URGES CEO 'DO SOMETHING'

She specifically pointed to tweets in which the president attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and suggested there would be ""big consequences"" for the whistleblower who reported on his call with Ukraine.

In a blog post from 2018, Twitter seemed to respond to other requests that it punish Trump for his tweets.

""Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation. Elected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society,"" the post read.

""Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate. It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions."""

Elizabeth Warren during the most recent Democratic presidential debate Tuesday for going too easy on big corporations.

The “Fahrenheit 9/11” filmmaker, 65, was tweeting during the event when something the 70-year-old presidential candidate said caught his attention. Warren explained that she has a plan to combat corporations only caring about their bottom line that she calls “accountable capitalism.”

MICHAEL MOORE BLASTS PRESIDENT TRUMP AT CANNES FILM FESTIVAL

In short, the plan calls on companies to be held accountable to their employees and their local communities rather than just shareholders. Moore, who has an estimated net worth of $50 million and who Business Insider previously reported has nine homes, is typically known for his left-leaning point of view. He took issue with Warren’s plan in that it doesn’t do enough to dismantle capitalism.

“Senator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in ‘accountable capitalism,’” Moore tweeted Tuesday. “There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It’s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.”

The “Bowling for Columbine” director also took jabs at former Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg for their respective stances on healthcare at the debate.

“Joe Biden, Amy K and Pete B just boosted the Republican chances of winning in November 2020 by their passionate defense of the for-profit, capitalist-greed health ‘care’ system,” he tweeted.

The only one that appeared safe from Moore’s taunts was Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Wow! BERNIE’S BACK!” he wrote. “Fighting the fight for working people for three long hours — just two weeks after a heart attack! Jeez. Amazing!”

Sanders returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked at the debate how he could “reassure” Americans that he was up for the task.

“We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I’m going to reassure the American people,” Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. “I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

The line of questioning started with Sanders, I-Vt., who just returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked how he could “reassure” Americans that he was up for the task.

“We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I’m going to reassure the American people,” Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. “I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Next came Biden—whose age has been a topic of conversation and criticism over the past several months on the campaign trail. CNN’s Erin Burnett quoted former President Jimmy Carter, who said that he wouldn’t have been able to start a presidential term at the age of 80, and pressed Biden why he thinks he could handle the pressure.

“Because I watched it, I know what the job is, I’ve been engaged,” Biden, 76, said, adding that “one of the reasons” he is running for president is his age—and with that, comes “wisdom.”

“We need someone in office this time around who on day one, on the world stage, can command respect from world leaders and know exactly what needs to be done to get this country back on track,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run this time because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before, I’ve been there.”

He added: “I will not need any on the job training.”

Biden, who has grappled with sustained critical media coverage of a string of gaffes on the campaign trail, then vowed to release his health records, along with his tax records, before the Iowa Caucuses in January—the first contest of the 2020 primary season.

“I’m the only guy who’s released anything up here,” he scoffed.

Warren, D-Mass., who is 70, brushed off her age, when asked to respond.

“I say I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” she said.

Meanwhile, President Trump, who is 73, has said he feels “young” and is ready for another term of his administration.

“I feel like a young man. I am a young, vibrant man,” Trump said in April.

Should Trump be re-elected, he would be 74 on Jan. 20, 2021—Inauguration Day. Should the presidency go to one of the elder Democrats in the field—Biden would be 78; Sanders would be 79; and Warren would be 71.

But the CNN and New York Times moderators shifted to the other end of the spectrum, pointing to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, for her young age of 38.

“It’s not fair to ask these three about their health and their wellness,” she said of the questions to Biden, Sanders and Warren. “Who is fit to serve as commander-in-chief?”

Gabbard said that she was, and further challenged the moderators to ask every candidate on the stage about their age and health—a suggestion that was ignored."

Sanders claimed Warren's ascension is a net positive for Trump and said her new position as frontrunner will rebrand her as the face of the party, to the detriment of other Democrats.

""She is the new face of the Democrat party,"" Sanders said. ""That is a great contrast for this president. And I think it sets him up very nicely for re-election in November.""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was seen by the moderators and her fellow candidates as the one to beat.

That point was evident with time allotted to each candidate. Warren had the most with nearly 23 minutes to answer questions – or about equal to what the bottom three candidates mustered, according to The New York Times.

There were some advantages to that. John Harwood of CNBC proclaimed “this debate crowning Warren the new 2020 front-runner.”

CNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'

But former CBS News anchor Dan Rather said that “the stage is more crowded than a Times Square subway stop.” And almost everyone on that stage was targeting Warren.

It didn’t go well for the senator from Massachusetts. The regular attacks often turned her into a whiny scold.

As CNN anchor John King later explained: “The candidates on the stage clearly thought it was in their best interest to go after Warren.”

Former CNN commentator Roland Martin said it even better, noting: “How do we know @ewarren is leading? She has a bullseye on her tonight.”

The Washington Post sold the debate with a headline sounding like it watched a far-more entertaining contest: “Warren faces first sustained attack in raucous debate.” At least it was right about the attacking.

The New York Times was more accurate in tone about the tedious three-hour marathon: “Warren Draws Fire From All Sides, Reflecting a Shift in Fortunes in Race.”

CNN host Van Jones reflected on the attacks, calling Warren: “Mortal. Mortal. Somebody grabbed the cape and pulled on it.” Jones explained that the “moderates” struck back, “tired of the woke-enomics.”

PBS White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor said it was a “BIG MOMENT” when the “Elizabeth Warren attacks begin.” As she described it: “Warren gives a tough stare” after “Mayor Pete Buttigieg says to Warren: Your signature is to have a plan for everything except health care.”

Even far-left Hollywood director Michael Moore wasn’t entirely happy with Warren’s prescriptions for change. He said: “Senator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in ‘accountable capitalism’. There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It’s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.”

But there was more to the debate than just attacks on Warren. There were also attacks on President Trump. Of course. CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject – one easy one for each candidate.

The result was laughably predictable – all the candidates showed that they hate Trump. The Post’s phrasing was a “unified condemnation of Trump.” Like no one saw that coming.

NBC News Correspondent Mike Memoli called the beginning of the debate “a moment of history,” adding that “1 participant may vote on articles of impeachment. 5 participants would sit as jurors in an impeachment trial.”

This is sure to please the major media that not only hate Trump but have financial interests in the impeachment. Axios reported that news outlets are “building pop-up newsletters, podcasts, and sections solely to cover the day-to-day developments of the impeachment process.” Those include Vox Media, CNN and The New York Times.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California scored one of the night’s few applause lines and news outlets went with her extreme narrative backing abortion, after she said: “And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.”

The debate was also predictably left-wing. Van Jones asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota a scary post-debate question for Democrats: “And I wonder, are you afraid that the party is going in a direction that is just going to get us killed here in the middle of the country?” Klobuchar responded about the party can “come together,” but it’s the kind of comment that will set the left and media worrying.

Add it to the amazingly quiet crowd. The Root’s Politics Editor Jason Johnson called it “the quietest audience I've ever seen in a debate.” Trump would have called that “low energy.” He’d have been right.

Even liberals weren’t always happy with all the candidates, especially the newest entrant into the race. Vox Senior Correspondent Zack Beauchamp made fun of the billionaire who just joined the campaign, but who always seems to wear the same tie. “While Tom Steyer wasted an unconscionable amount of money getting on stage and did absolutely nothing to justify his presence here, his tie is pretty good.”

Bustle Deputy News Editor Catherine Thompson took her own shot at his debating style: “Tom Steyer is gesticulating and speaking like he’s a ventriloquist’s dummy carved out of wood.”

But CNN had Steyer’s back. It initially listed him as a “former hedge fund manager.” That wasn’t nice enough to a guy who buys so much TV advertising. So it somehow got changed to “Businessman.”

Because CNN is neutral. And not in it for the money.

And Washington Post Opinion Writer Elizabeth Bruenig was equally critical of former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke after a few candidates were asked about their age. “i mean look. yes, as you get older, your brain gets worse. but that's just a general trend. look at beto. he's very young and his brain is very bad.”

There was one especially unusual highlight of the debate. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii bashed the “mainstream media” like she was running in the Republican primary. She explained that The “New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war.” Those news organizations were the two hosts of the debate.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate, but the former vice president has a potentially larger headache – a lack of campaign cash.

As Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.

BIDEN'S THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING HAUL A WARNING SIGN

According to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.

Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, pressed on the report, told reporters in the spin room after the debate in suburban Columbus, Ohio that “it’s more important how you spend the money than how you raise it.""

And she emphasized that “we have resources that we need to continue to run our race. We’ve always said we think this race is going to be a dogfight, that it’s going to go long. We’re building an operation that is going to be sustained.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

On Wednesday, Biden said he was confident he had the fundraising to make it to the general election.

“Our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online. And we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready,” he told reporters at a campaign event in Ohio.

And taking aim at Warren – who transferred more than $10 million from her 2018 Senate re-election campaign to her White House bid – Biden noted he “did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from, into a race.”

It was just two weeks ago that Biden was left in the dust by Warren, Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg when it came to their third-quarter fundraising hauls. And unlike Warren and Sanders – who’ve brought in most of their money from small-dollar grassroots donations -- much of Biden’s money comes from top-dollar fundraising events with big-bucks donors.

A Democratic consultant who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely called the $15.2 million Biden raised in the third quarter “a devastating number.”

Taking an indirect shot at Biden, Warren campaign chief strategist Joe Rospars highlighted the new data released Tuesday.

“The FEC report data are pretty stark. There’s nowhere to hide from the reality of the dollars and the calendar in front of us,” Rospars tweeted on Wednesday. “Is a campaign’s fundraising growing? Is its spending able to grow going into the early contests, as it must? For Warren, the answers are yes and yes.”

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.

Ceraso, who worked on Sanders’ 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or “his cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.”

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised left him, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

Republicans spotlighted Biden’s campaign cash on hand figures as a warning sign for a candidate who has already relinquished his status as the unrivaled front-runner in the polls.

“Biden’s money problems are now a crisis for the campaign and if he doesn’t turn it around soon, he’ll end up on the sidelines sooner than anyone anticipated,” emphasized Joe Gierut, press secretary for the pro-Republican America Rising PAC.

Fundraising is far from definitive, but like polling, it’s an important barometer of a candidate’s momentum and his or her campaign’s strength. Among the things funds can be used for are building staff and grassroots outreach efforts in the crucial early voting states and running TV, radio, and digital ads.

Biden ‘eclipsed’ on 2020 debate stage

The spotlight on the former vice president’s campaign cash numbers came as the spotlight at the debate shifted from him to Warren, who has soared in recent months and is now tied in most national and early voting state polling with Biden for the top spot in the nomination race.

Biden was front-and-center as the debate kicked off, focusing on the Ukrainian controversy and the impeachment inquiry.

But when the conversation turned to the battle over ""Medicare-for-all,"" the former vice president was mostly absent from the discussion as the spotlight shifted to Warren.

The populist senator, who has produced one progressive policy proposal after another, grabbed the most speaking time in the debate, roughly six more minutes than Biden, who was second.

“He faded at times,” noted Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of the Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor. ""He popped his head up occasionally.

“He did allow himself to get eclipsed by some others, like Buttigieg and (Sen. Amy) Klobuchar and some of the others,” added Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign who later steered communications for the Democratic National Committee. “He’s got to step up. He cannot miss opportunities and I think he missed a few.”

GOP strategist and presidential campaign veteran Colin Reed called Biden “nearly invisible” at the debate and said it’s “a sign of how far this campaign has fallen that no one bothers to go after him.”

But Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a top Biden friend and 2020 surrogate, told reporters in the spin room on Tuesday night that being out of the spotlight benefitted Biden.

“Unlike previous debates where the vast majority of the attention was focused on testing or challenging Vice President Biden, tonight was a night when Sen. Warren’s plans on a wide range of issues – from the wealth tax to 'Medicare-for-all' – came under repeated questioning,” Coons highlighted.

Biden echoed that sentiment on Wednesday, saying ""it's kind of about time other people get questioned.""

And he pushed back on the labeling of Warren as a co-front-runner, saying “I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., released the results of her DNA test that suggested she did have something of a Native American heritage, it appears she and her campaign removed all tweets, videos, and webpages that documented the elaborate rollout.

On Tuesday, PJ Media commemorated the ""one-year anniversary"" of Warren's publicized DNA results, which had been aimed at silencing critics who claimed the 2020 frontrunner falsely declared herself Native American in order to advance her career. According to the analysis, Warren may be anywhere between 1/64 and 1/1024 Native American.

As part of the reveal, Warren made tweets, had an entire ""Fact Squad"" page on her campaign website and posted a video documenting the entire process of her ancestry discovery. However, PJ Media also flagged that all web posts about the DNA results from Warren and her campaign were subsequently scrubbed from the Internet, including Twitter, YouYube and the Warren campaign site.

The Wayback Machine, an Internet archiving service, showed that links to her tweet, the ""Fact Squad"" page on her heritage and the YouTube video were no longer active.

The Warren campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

For months, Warren has been targeted by critics for her previous claims of having Native American roots, most notably from President Trump, who has lambasted her as ""Pocahontas"" at campaign rallies.

""I'm tired of hearing -- whenever I say these things -- 'oh, it's Republican talking points.' You are making Republican talking points right now in this room,"" Klobuchar said. She appeared to be referring to Warren's comments during a previous debate in which she accused the moderators of parroting Republican talking points by raising concerns about ""Medicare-for-all.""

Warren, D-Mass., has repeatedly refused to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class. During Tuesday's debate, she maintained that she would lower costs for everyone except the wealthy and large corporations. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has similarly pledged to lower costs but disclosed that his plan would entail raising taxes.

PETE BUTTIGIEG RELEASES AD CRITICAL OF SANDERS' AND WARREN'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' HEALTH PLANS

Both Warren and Sanders have been at the forefront of pushing ""Medicare-for-all,"" a controversial and sweeping proposal that would effectively limit private health insurance. But Klobuchar suggested that Warren's plan was a ""pipe dream"" without naming specifics like tax increases.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg specifically called out Warren over this issue, arguing that she was taking away Americans' choice with her plan. Both he and Klobuchar instead pushed a public option.

Warren responded by arguing that Buttigieg's plan -- ""Medicare for all who want it"" -- would actually limit coverage to people who could afford it. She also shared several stories from the campaign trail of voters who went bankrupt because of medical costs.

During an interview with Radio Iowa later Sunday afternoon, Biden said if he is elected, he will not follow President Ford’s example in pardoning Nixon so Nixon was not prosecuted for his role in Watergate. “It wouldn’t unite the country,” Biden said. “You’d say: ‘Wait a minute. I get a parking ticket and I’ve got to pay it. This happens to me and I’ve got to go to jail. This guy does all these things that put us jeopardy and he gets off? I think this is of a different nature. And I think President Ford, God love him, he’s a good guy, I knew him pretty well. I think if he had to do it over again, he wouldn’t have done it … because he didn’t get re-elected.”

As regular readers know, I’ve been keeping an eye on this for a while, because for Donald Trump, winning a second term next year is about more than just power and ego; it’s also about the statute of limitations.

After all, the president has been implicated in a variety of alleged crimes, though Trump appears to be shielded from prosecution so long as he’s in office. If he were to lose in 2020, that shield would disappear, and the prospect of an indictment would become quite real. Indeed, by most accounts, the only way for Trump to ensure he faces no criminal liability is for him to remain president for another four years.

But let’s say he doesn’t. For the sake of conversation, let’s imagine Trump not only loses the popular vote again, but also comes up short in the electoral college. Let’s also say it’s 2021 and the president’s Democratic successor, recognizing the possibility of Trump facing an indictment, has to decide whether to pull a Gerald Ford and issue a pardon for his/her scandal-plagued predecessor.

Biden is now committed to not pardoning Trump, and the Delaware Democrat isn’t alone.

In late February, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) got the ball rolling in a blog post published to Medium. “[L]et me be perfectly clear, in the way that everyone who might be President next should be: If I’m elected President of the United States, there will be no pardons for anyone implicated in these investigations. Everyone who might succeed Donald Trump as president should adopt the same policy.”

Two weeks later, MSNBC’s Chris Matthews sat down with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and brought up Ford’s 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon. “Would you consider pardoning Trump if you took the presidency?” the host asked.

Booker didn’t hesitate. “No,” the senator said.

In May, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) was asked if he’d be willing to pardon Trump. “Uh, no,” the governor replied. “I would not.”

Circling back to our earlier coverage, as 2020 issues go, this one is inherently speculative. No one can say with confidence whether a prosecutor would even want to try to indict Trump after he leaves office.

It’s far easier to say, however, that the Republican’s criminal liability is real, and if a Democrat wins the presidency next year, he or she will have to at least consider the possibility of seeing his or her predecessor face criminal charges.

Don’t be surprised if every Democratic candidate goes on the record on this issue in the coming weeks and months.

Postscript: I’ve highlighted the comments from Biden, Booker, Bullock, and Warren because they crossed my radar, but it’s entirely possible that other Democratic candidates have weighed in. If campaign aides for the other Democratic candidates see this post, and they want me to update it with additional statements, I’m happy to do so."

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night’s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run Medicare-for-all plan.

After being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate at Otterbein University whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health care proposal, the progressive senator from Massachusetts didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Moments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who’s soared in polling in recent months and is now considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden.

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued that “your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Buttigieg then touted his plan for “Medicare-for-all-who-want it,” which, unlike the Medicare-for-all proposal championed by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would not eliminate private insurance.

Warren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: “Let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,' understand what that means: It’s 'Medicare for all who can afford it.' And that’s the problem we’ve got. Medicare-for-all is the gold standard.”

But Mayor Pete counterpunched: “I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years.”

DEMOCRATS UNITE IN IMPEACHING TRUMP AT TOP OF TUESDAY'S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON

Sanders, who authored the Medicare-for-all bill in the Senate, chimed in, noting that “as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I say, let’s be clear, under the Medicare-for-all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone.""



But then he said “it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up” before adding that “for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.”

Asked again by the moderators if she would acknowledge what Sanders had just said, that middle-class taxes would rise, Warren answered, “What I have committed to is that costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren.

The Minnesota Democrat said that “at least Bernie’s being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

Suggesting that Warren would never be able to pass her Medicare-for-all plan through Congress, Klobuchar said ""the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.""

Biden also chimed in, jabbing at Warren without naming her, accusing her of not being straightforward.

""On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them,"" Biden noted. ""The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.""

And he charged that under the Sanders and Warren plan, ""if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work."""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden locked in a close race for their party’s nomination.

Warren stood at 30 percent support in a Quinnipiac University survey Monday of Democratic voters and independents who leaned toward the party. Biden, the unrivaled front-runner until Warren’s surge in the polls the past couple of months, was at 27 percent.

Warren’s three percentage point advantage was within the survey’s margin of error.

GABBARD BACKS DOWN AFTER DEBATE BOYCOTT THREAT

The poll was the third conducted by Quinnipiac since late last month showing Warren with a slight edge over Biden.

“For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. “Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stood at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent.

Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking – but still large – field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.

Quinnipiac’s survey differed from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.

Twelve candidates qualified for Tuesday’s debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are – in alphabetical order – Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang.

While national primary horserace polls have grabbed plenty of attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. And, a new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.

Warren stood at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stood at 9 percent and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.

In New Hampshire’s Republican presidential contest, President Trump remained the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 11-13, with 1,195 self-identified registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that she would no longer be accepting campaign donations of more than $200 from big businesses and challenged her fellow White House hopefuls to be more transparent about how they’re funding their own campaigns.

Warren blasted some of her Democratic primary rivals in a post on Medium, in which she accused them of “hobnobbing with the rich and powerful” and “handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors.”

“I’m proud to be running a grassroots-funded campaign for president, and I hope my fellow candidates for the Democratic nomination will do the same,” Warren wrote. “That’s why I’m also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign…and to disclose the dates and locations of their fundraising events and the names of every person who appears on a host committee on invitations tied to those events.”

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Warren added: “If Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so – but they shouldn’t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors. Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition — and how much it costs.”

In her post, Warren does not specifically call out any of her fellow candidates, but her words appear to be a rebuke of Democratic presidential primary hopefuls like former Vice President Joe Bide, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Each of these candidates have raised millions of dollars through fundraisers and private events with wealthy donors — a practice that is common in both major political parties in the U.S.

Warren, along with fellow candidate and Vermont lawmaker Bernie Sanders, have spurned big-dollar donors this campaign season, in favor of relying on small-dollar, online donations. The results have surprisingly seen them outraising other candidates last quarter.

Warren’s critics have slammed her for holding fundraisers in the past and using some of the money left in her war chest to launch her 2020 presidential bid. But since announcing her candidacy, Warren has not taken any PAC or big-dollar donations.

“I’m not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,” Warren wrote. “And when I’m the Democratic nominee for president, I’m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists. No special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign.”

Despite outraising most other candidates last quarter, Warren’s rivals still say that the small-dollar donations will hinder her chances of defeating President Trump should she win the Democratic nomination.

“We're not going to beat him with pocket change,"" Buttigieg said in a Snapchat post, adding that Democrats ""need the full spectrum of support in order to compete.”"

The exchange went viral on social media and earned Warren high praise from the left.

Marcus praised Warren's delivery as charismatic but said the senator took a risk by being morally presumptuous and assuming the high ground with millions of key voters.

Marcus viewed the moment as ""a mistake that evoked missteps of Democratic campaigns past — a dismissiveness that Warren and her fellow candidates would do well to avoid.""

""This is bad politics, which may be the strongest immediate argument for shifting course, yet it is something worse than that,"" Marcus wrote. ""It reflects an attitude of intolerance and disrespect toward people of faith. Those who reasonably expect tolerance and respect should think about — well, they should think about the importance of practicing what they preach.""

Marcus cited the religious right's resistance to gay marriage and said dissenters deserve to be treated with a modicum of respect and tolerance instead of being talked down to.

""Major religions, including the Catholic Church, continue to teach that homosexual conduct is immoral and to oppose same-sex marriage. That is their right,"" she wrote. ""As that enterprise proceeds, it is important that it be conducted with the respect that Warren failed to display.""

Bruce claimed Monday on ""Hannity"" that such programs are reminiscent of socialist policies, which have failed repeatedly throughout history.

""The thing that all these issues have in common is a disdain for the American people, is a contempt for our ability to understand our own lives, to make our own decisions, to realize what freedom really is, that we can be trusted with freedom, that we are decent people, that we, in fact, make better decisions than government,"" she said.

""Socialism is an old, dead, tired idea. It is nothing new and it has always failed.""

Pointing to the former Soviet Union, Cuba and Venezuela, Bruce said socialism has a track record of failure, but that history does not faze its current proponents.

""They're still addicted to this notion that they're better than us, that they're the ones who can make the decisions that we can't -- that we're too dumb to know that we can't trust ourselves,"" she said.

On Sunday, self-proclaimed democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., brought up the topic when discussing progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. -- a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate like himself.

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ""I am a capitalist to my bones.""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the big winner Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also delivered strong performances.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and the other eight candidates on stage came out the losers in the three-hour Democratic presidential primary debate.

BIGGEST WINNER: Elizabeth Warren

Warren’s strong performance will likely solidify her frontrunner status ahead of Biden and Sanders. She emerged the clear winner of the night by showing she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

Even during the heated exchanges over health care and a wealth tax, Warren was able to turn attacks leveled against her around, and still deliver the best answers of the evening.

Warren questioned why the other candidates “think it is more important to protect billionaires than to invest in Americans” when responding to an attack on her plan for a wealth tax.

And importantly, Warren remained the focal point of the debate, speaking for the most amount of time of all of the candidates.

The senator from Massachusetts now has unmatched fundraising and polling momentum, along with a series of strong debate performances. This, coupled with the fact that Biden and Sanders have been weakened in dissimilar but debilitating ways recently, almost guarantees that Warren will take over as the front-runner.

SURPRISE WINNER: Bernie Sanders

Sanders has faced a precipitous decline in the most recent polls given the significant questions about his health and stamina following his recent heart attack.

However, Sanders delivered a strong, forceful performance in the debate, succeeding in showing voters that he has not lost a step, making him the second-place finisher of the night.

But it is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

It is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

SURPRISE WINNER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg has been called the breakout star of the Democratic field – though he has recently struggled to distinguish himself. He had several strong moments in the Tuesday night debate. He was able to make a compelling case as a young, center-left candidate from a swing state with a military background.

Buttigieg was particularly strong during a tense exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over President Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, delivering a response that elicited cheers from the audience.

“Respectfully congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” the mayor said. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it's a consequence of a withdrawal and betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

Ultimately, Buttigieg’s performance will likely result in a post-debate polling bump with moderate voters, especially given Biden’s relatively weak debate performance.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Joe Biden

All eyes, particularly those of Democratic leaders, strategists, and donors were on Biden, who needed deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump.

However, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

With each passing day, Biden seems to move further from securing the Democratic presidential nomination, and his unimpressive performance Tuesday night will likely result in a post-debate polling decline.

LOSER: Amy Klobuchar

Additionally, although Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had a number of well-executed lines taking aim at Warren, many felt similar to the inconsequential attacks leveled against Warren by former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland during the first debate. Thus, Klobuchar’s performance is unlikely to result in the post-debate polling spike her campaign needed.

LOSER: Kamala Harris

Sen. Kamala Harris of California similarly fell short, as she failed to distinguish herself in any meaningful way at a time when her campaign desperately needs a boost. Given that recent polls have her hoovering at around 5 percent, she will likely not be able to regain the momentum she had just over two months ago.

LOSERS: Gabbard, Castro, Steyer, Booker, O’Rourke and Yang

The remaining candidates – all barely registering in polls – were the biggest losers of the night. Rep. Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas and entrepreneur Andrew Yang failed to have the breakout moment they all desperately needed to show voters they could defeat Trump in November 2020.

Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed.

In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event.

""Bernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography,"" Omar was quoted as saying in a statement posted on Twitter by the Sanders campaign — and that Omar retweeted on her own Twitter page.

Word of the endorsements also followed Tuesday night’s Democratic debate in Ohio, where Warren was under attack from multiple candidates after rising in the polls in recent weeks.

Winning the OK of the “Squad” members was also viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens — Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70 years old.

There was no indication that the fourth member of the Squad, Rep. Ayannna Pressley, D-Mass., was ready to make an endorsement — either of Sanders or any other candidate.

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate, as former Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

All of the 12 Democrats onstage in Westerville, Ohio, meanwhile, backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

The debate marked the first time the candidates met since Pelosi's news conference last month at which she unilaterally declared the inquiry had begun -- a move that the White House has said is legally insufficient. The candidate lineup set a record for most politicians on a single debate stage, topping the 11 Republican candidates who assembled in 2016.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

""Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry,"" Warren, D-Mass., asserted at the outset of the debate, when asked why Congress should bother with the process given the impending election.

Biden has been at the top of the crowded field for months, but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

The elder Biden faced something of a timid confrontation over the issue during the debate, when CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper broached the topic by stating, without evidence, that President Trump's accusations of misconduct by the Bidens were ""false.""

But Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. (“I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,” the younger Biden said Tuesday morning.)

Joe Biden recently pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were to be elected president -- a tacit admission, Republicans said, of previous poor judgment or even wrongdoing.

""Look, my son's statement speaks for itself,"" Biden said. “My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government which was to root out corruption in Ukraine, and that’s what we should be focusing on.”

Biden insisted he never discussed Ukraine matters with Hunter, although Hunter separately told The New Yorker magazine that the dealings had come up in one instance.

PROOF OF LINKS: FOX NEWS OBTAINS PHOTO SHOWING BIDENS GOLFING WITH UKRAINE EXEC, SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTING FORMER VP'S CLAIMS

He concluded: ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on.""

Later on, as the debate heated up, Biden remarked: “These debates are kinda crazy."" In a head-turning moment, he also stumbled over his words, saying wealthy individuals might be found ""clipping coupons in the stock market.""

Separately, asked about Trump's policy in Syria, Biden appeared to give an extended answer in which he meant to talk about Turkish President Recep Erdoğan -- but kept referencing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad instead.

HUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON HOW HE OBTAINED LUCRATIVE GIGS WITH NO RELEVANT EXPERTISE, BUT A VERY POWERFUL FATHER

Asked about his health toward the end of the debate, Biden vowed to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses are held, and said his age (76) gives him ""wisdom.""

Hunter Biden obtained other high-paying board positions domestically and internationally, with no relevant expertise, while his father was a senator and vice president. For example, Hunter became an executive at the financial services company MBNA just two years after leaving law school. MBNA sources told Fox News this week that the company was trying to curry favor with Joe Biden, who was shepherding a bill favored by MBNA to passage in the Senate.

Meanwhile, Warren has climbed to co-front runner status but faces new questions about her dubious claims to Native American ancestry.

She was under attack from all sides at the debate for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class.

""I appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said to Warren. ""At least Bernie’s being honest here. ... I’m sorry, Elizabeth.”

“These debates are kinda crazy."" — Joe Biden

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also lambasted Warren on health care: “Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" he said.

Buttigieg specifically knocked Warren for the nonanswer, saying her failure to offer a direct answer is ""why people are so frustrated with politicians"" and arguing that ""Medicare-for-All"" would ""unnecessarily divide this country.""

""We heard it tonight,"" Buttigieg said. ""A yes-or-no question that didn't get a yes-or-no answer."" He said he wanted a plan that could be summed up as ""Medicare-for-All"" if you choose it, not whether you want it or not.

Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke also pressed Warren on the tax issue, to no avail. (Later on, O'Rourke had no answer when Cooper asked how he could confiscate Americans' firearms, given that the government has no way of knowing where the vast majority of AR-15s are located. He said only that he believes Americans ""will do the right thing"" voluntarily.)

Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the ""Medicare-for-All"" legislation that Warren has embraced, said it was ""appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up.""

Sanders, who Fox News has confirmed will soon be endorsed by New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also spoke about his recent heart attack: “But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. ... And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Also during the debate, Democrats also piled onto Warren for her signature proposal, a 2 percent wealth tax to raise the trillions needed for many of her ambitious proposals. Technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang noted that such a measure has failed in almost every European country where it's been tried.

The event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, was on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

Many of the candidates were struggling just to get noticed — trying to make up ground in a race that kicks off officially in just over three months with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are trying to crack the top tier.

In one possible indicator the debate was a lengthy one, Harris briefly mentioned her proposal to have Twitter take Trump's account down, and demanded that Warren explain why she felt that approach was unwise. Warren, who last week laughed openly when informed by a reporter of Harris' idea, responded that she wants Trump out of the White House, not just banned from Twitter.

Progressives and right-wing commentators alike were aghast at Harris' decision to again bring up the unrealistic and unpopular idea of somehow suspending Trump from Twitter.

""I cannot believe @KamalaHarris is pushing this suspend Donald Trump's twitter account bullshit at a presidential debate,"" former Obama administration official and Pod Save America cohost Tommy Vietor wrote on Twitter. ""It's so small ball. She is bigger and better than this.""

Fellow Obama administration alumnus and podcast host Ben Rhodes added: ""Seems like there are bigger issues in the world.""

Also debating were Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Obama housing chief Julián Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Making his debate debut — and likely angling for a splash — was billionaire activist Tom Steyer.

Gabbard hit The New York Times and CNN for waging what she called a propaganda campaign against her, while also promoting endless ""regime-change wars.""

""The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Gabbard has criticized Trump for how he's conducted the withdrawal in Syria, but said Tuesday that while Trump has ""the blood of the Kurds on his hands. ... So do many of the politicians in both parties who supported this regime change war.""

Gabbard, who was one of the last Democratic House members to back an impeachment inquiry, additionally lamented that some Democrats had been calling for Trump's impeachment since right after the 2016 election, undermining the party's case against him.

The debate's foreign policy discussion concluded without any mention by the moderators of the ongoing push by China to censor American companies, including the NBA and Blizzard Entertainment, from making or tolerating pro-Hong Kong statements. Buttigieg briefly mentioned that the Hong Kong protests were not receiving support from the White House.

Yang's plan for a universal basic income spurred a discussion onstage concerning whether a federal jobs guarantee is a better plan -- something of a remarkable achievement for Yang, who has struggled in the polls while advancing his own unique agenda.

On abortion, the Democrats agreed they would support a federal law ""codifying"" the Supreme Court's holding in Roe v. Wade, which found a constitutional right to abortion, as a kind of defense in case the Supreme Court overturned Roe. At the same time, Biden emphasized he would not support ""court packing,"" or passing a federal law to expand the size of the Supreme Court to load it with Democratic justices.

Buttigieg then said he did not support court packing, but wanted ""reforms"" to make the court less significant -- including possibly a ""fifteen member court, where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other ten."" A similar idea was being debated in the Yale Law Journal, Buttigieg said, in a shout-out to the left-wing student publication.

Gabbard said that Democrats were right decades ago when they said abortion should be ""safe, legal, and rare"" -- highlighting a shift to the left among Democrats.

The 2020 field, which once had swelled to two dozen, has been shrinking as the Democratic Party's rules have mandated that candidates meet higher donor and fundraising thresholds to debate.

Earlier contests featuring 20 candidates were divided between two nights.

But, that’s just the first of many factors that could make this showdown – the first in a month – stand out.

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS A 'CAPITALIST'

“Since the last Democratic debate, the presidential race has dramatically shifted. Tonight is the first major gathering since the opening of the impeachment inquiry,” former Democratic National Committee chair and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile said.

The debate also comes as Joe Biden lost his long-held status as the unrivaled front-runner. The former vice president suddenly has been neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in many of the recent national and early-voting-state polls. And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and fellow progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

The showdown also comes two weeks after the 78-year old Sanders suffered a heart attack. The debate is set to mark his return to the campaign trail and with questions regarding his health and stamina, the independent senator making his second straight White House run will be under the microscope.

With all that in mind, here are eight things to watch at the debate.

Impeachment

The debate is the first held since House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was pressuring a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before the phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been put on hold; it ultimately was released in September. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, the president insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no “quid pro quo” and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

While all the candidates on the stage supported impeaching the president, the impeachment inquiry clearly will overshadow the showdown -- but will it dominate the debate to the detriment of other top issues in the Democrats’ presidential nomination race?

“There is a real danger that the substance of the debate is limited by the impeachment inquiry,” warned veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs at New England College.

Biden and Biden

While only one Biden will be on the stage, another certainly will be part of the conversation. While the former vice president is expected to use impeachment to frame the race as a fight between himself and the Republican incumbent, he likely will face questions about his son just hours after Hunter Biden’s first public interview since the start of the Ukrainian controversy.

As the president has fought back against impeachment, he and his allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on the Bidens.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden – as vice president – pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Trump’s also repeatedly raised questions about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Chinese private equity firm. This past Sunday, Hunter Biden resigned from the company – and on Tuesday morning – just hours before the debate – broke his silence in an interview with ABC News’ “Good Morning America.""

The younger Biden maintained that he did nothing improper while he served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company. But he acknowledged that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Some of Biden’s lower-tier rivals, looking for a breakout moment, may be tempted to criticize him over the optics of having his son sit on the boards of foreign companies while he served as vice president. However, it may be a slippery slope, as none of the Democrats seeking to unseat Trump may want to play into his playbook of targeting the Bidens.

Sanders’ health

“I’m ready,” Sanders emphasized in an email to supporters on Monday.

While all the candidates will be under the spotlight, it will shine extra bright for Sanders, who would have a unique challenge in needing to showcase that he hasn’t lost a step, and quell concerns that he may not be up to speed.

Analysts pointed out Sanders would need to show strength and agility, but the question for his rivals would be whether it’s a fair game for them to raise concerns about his health. Questions were raised about the late Sen. John McCain’s medical condition during the 2008 campaign and about the health of both candidates four years ago.

Sanders vs. Warren

Aside from some sniping by some of his top advisors, Sanders has not criticized Warren, as she’s mostly passed him by in the polls the past two months.

That’s why his labeling of his friend and populist senator – who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another – as a “capitalist” made so much news this weekend.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.” “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Will Sanders continue to draw contrasts with the rising Warren at the debate?

A former Sanders adviser – who for months raised alarms that Warren, rather than Biden, was the real threat – said the drawing of distinctions may be a necessity.

“Unfortunately, it’s a sign of concern on the part of Bernie and his camp that Warren is beating him with the voters that he needs,” noted Kurt Ehrenberg, a top adviser for Sanders in New Hampshire and the 2016 and 2020 campaigns who recently parted ways with the campaign.

A more aggressive Biden?

The former vice president seemed to get a second wind last week during two speeches in New Hampshire, when Biden gave a full-throated thrashing of Trump as he called for the president’s impeachment for the first time. Will that aggressive style of campaigning continue on the debate stage in Ohio?

“One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive,” Biden acknowledged during a fundraiser late last week in California. “I’ve had some difficulties on knowing to counterattack.”

A senior Biden campaign adviser told Fox News hours before the debate that ""what you'll hear tonight from the VP is that first and foremost, we have to keep the focus on Donald Trump's unprecedented abuse of power.""

Back in the spotlight

Health care – specifically the intra-party battle over “Medicare-for-all,” immigration, race relations and other domestically focused issues – has dominated the discourse at the first three rounds of debates. Foreign policy mostly has been relegated to the garbage time late in the showdowns, when the number of viewers dwindled.

But, with Turkey’s attack on northern Syria, unfolding soon after the president’s move to withdraw U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against ISIS militants, questions about Trump’s record on the world stage could be back in the spotlight.

That may benefit the candidates with foreign policy experience. Besides the obvious – Biden – such a discussion could give the two veterans in the field who’ve served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – a moment to shine.

Looking for a breakout moment

The debate could provide the opportunity the mid-tier candidates have been seeking – a standout moment in front of millions of viewers with less than four months to go until the voting begins in Iowa. Buttigieg, Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas all have been looking to gain some traction and break up the narrative that the race has been a three-candidate contest between Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

So will businessman and billionaire environment and progressive activist Tom Steyer, who’s making his first appearance on the debate stage.

Buttigieg – in a likely tease of things to come – took aim at Warren and Sanders for proposing to scrap private insurance as he touted his Medicare-for-all-who-want-it plan a new digital ad hours before the debate.

“Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished,” the narrator says in the ad.

Unpredictable moments

Gabbard made headlines in the second round of debates in July when she took aim at Harris, firing away at the former California attorney general’s record as a prosecutor. Last week, she made headlines when she threatened to boycott the debate to protest the “rigging” of the debates and the race for the nomination by the Democratic National Committee and its media partners.

Gabbard announced Monday morning that she would take part in the debate after all, and her planned appearance – after failing to qualify for the September showdown – had analysts wondering what she had next up here sleeve.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro also has been looking to make some news. Castro – whose attacks on Biden’s age and memory at the September debate backfired, according to many analysts – is set to appear on the stage for what could possibly be the last time.

With the thresholds rising for the November showdown, Castro made a fundraising pitch to supporters, telling them ""I refuse to let tonight be my last time on the debate stage.""

A big debate moment would give him a boost to reach the new qualifying criteria."

Given Joe Biden’s refusal to do any interviews since impeachment cast a spotlight on his family’s conduct, it was striking that he handed the ball to his son before the one forum where he couldn’t duck questions: the CNN/New York Times marathon.

And 17 minutes into the Ohio debate, when Anderson Cooper asked Biden the question, he retreated to “my son’s statement speaks for itself”—precisely the point of orchestrating the ABC interview.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

Cooper asked a key question: If Hunter Biden now says he won’t do any foreign work if his dad becomes president, why was it okay when Joe was vice president?

Biden ignored that, saying “my son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong,” then pivoted to denouncing Rudy Giuliani, President Trump and his “thugs” as liars. He would not acknowledge the lousy optics that even Hunter conceded.

The striking aftermath: None of the other Democrats on the stage said a negative word about Biden or his son’s lucrative deal in Ukraine. They deemed it off limits. Cory Booker defended Biden, saying no one should be “attacking a statesman.”

But Cooper also softened the question by saying “the president has made false accusations against your son” and “there is no evidence of wrongdoing by you and your son.” Why not let Biden make that case? Why appear to take sides? And is there absolutely no wrongdoing by Hunter, who was unqualified for the Ukrainian gas gig, as opposed to no evidence of criminal wrongdoing?

The only real action was on health care, though it wasn’t as exciting as the Washington Nationals scoring seven first-inning runs on their way to the World Series. In fact, that part of the debate seemed more like an old replay.

Once again, a journalist—in this case Marc Lacey of the Times—asked Elizabeth Warren if the middle class would pay more under the Medicare for All measure she is pushing.

Once again, Warren rolled out her standard response: The rich and big corporations will pay more, the middle class will pay less.

Lacey followed up—will you raise middle-class taxes?—and once again, the Massachusetts senator sidestepped: “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.” Notice she said costs, not taxes. (Bernie Sanders, who wrote the damn bill, admits middle-class taxes will rise.)

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Pete Buttigieg was more blunt, saying Warren had failed to answer a yes or no question. She dodged it again.

Amy Klobuchar, showing unusual aggressiveness, said Warren would kick 150 million Americans off their private insurance. I don’t know why the debate questioners don’t focus on this rather crucial point.

Biden said what he said in the last debate, that Medicare for All would cost $30 trillion over a decade and taxes would go up, but his rejoinder had less force.

After that, the debate settled into something of a wonkfest. What about auto jobs? Should there be a wealth tax? Can gun buybacks work? CNN’s practice of usually letting each of the 12 candidates answer the same question added to the drone factor.

Something else was at work. It’s now clear that the race has settled into a contest between Biden and Warren, with Sanders (looking vigorous despite his heart attack) continuing to slip. Everyone else has been mired in single digits for many months. So there’s far less media excitement if Kamala Harris has a strong moment or Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke get into a spat on gun control. Impeachment dominated the pregame programming, with the debate a secondary story.

The moderators, who included Erin Burnett, were fine, but could have done far more to sharpen the contrasts between the contenders.

On Trump’s pullout from northern Syria, Biden was strikingly emotional, saying of the Kurds: “They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful, what this man has done!” Warren accused Trump of giving ISIS a new lease on life. Buttigieg called it a “betrayal.” The only dissenter was Tulsi Gabbard, who wants to end the ""endless war"" and accused CNN and the Times of smearing her.

But such brief fireworks were the exception, and that was the weakness of the debate. Far too much time was spent on the candidates denouncing Trump in unison, sometimes just changing the adjectives. That undoubtedly made Democratic viewers feel good, but did little to distinguish among the contenders.

That pattern began at the outset, when Cooper asked about impeachment. While he tried mixing up the questions—why not let the voters evict Trump instead, is impeachment a distraction?—every Democrat on the stage competed to castigate the president in stronger terms (Bernie won with “most corrupt in history""). Biden and Warren talked about the Mueller report, making clear that they were primed for impeachment before the Ukraine mess surfaced.

The only real change from the last three debates was that Biden briefly had to defend his son’s buckraking in Ukraine. Impeachment has frozen the race, and that’s bad news for anyone not named Joe or Elizabeth."

Elizabeth Warren to attacks on the specific questions asked by moderators.

The Hill media reporter Joe Concha told Fox News that CNN’s debate enhanced its already not-so-respectable reputation.

TULSI GABBARD SLAMS CNN, NEW YORK TIMES DURING DEBATE FOR 'DESPICABLE' 'SMEARS' OVER SYRIA, RUSSIA

“The network is under heavy criticism from the left and right today, and rightly so,” Concha said. “Its pursuit of sizzle over steak and focus on social issues over truly substantiate matters – economy, jobs, opioid crisis, border crisis, all-things China – has damaged the network's credibility even further.”

CNN partnered up with The New York Times for the event, which was moderated by CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and Gray Lady editor Marc Lacey. While viewers complained about several issues with the moderators, a question Cooper asked about Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush’s friendship was perhaps the most lampooned.

“Three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration,” Julian Castro tweeted. “Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border. But you know, Ellen.”

CNN FACES MORE ACCUSATIONS OF POLITICAL BIAS AHEAD OF DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Sen. Kamala Harris also took to Twitter to criticize the moderators, noting there weren’t questions about climate change, LGBTQ rights or immigration.

“These issues are too important to ignore,” Harris wrote.

While Castro and Harris used social media, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hi., slammed CNN and The Times directly from the debate stage over what she described as ""smears"" against her on foreign policy.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall said the major flaw was that moderators allowed Sen. Elizabeth Warren to dominate the proceedings.

“The time imbalance was so obvious and quite unfair to Gabbard, Castro and the others. That Warren is now or at the top of recent polls is no excuse for allowing such an imbalance,” McCall told Fox News. “A candidate forum is supposed to give all candidates a fair opportunity to engage the dialogue and that absolutely did not happen. The debate moderators apparently don't own stopwatches.”

McCall said the imbalance “lends credence to the critics who say these forums are all about promoting some candidates over others” and Warren was clearly the favorite.

CNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'

“The moderators were also quite powerless at times when they tried to move on or determine who would speak next. Candidates tended to ignore the moderators’ directions and interrupt as they wanted,” McCall said, adding that talking over the moderators is nothing new.

“This is standard procedure now in these televised spectacles, but it remains a weakness in the format and relegates moderators to bystanders at times,” he said.

The debate came hours after a secretly recorded video appeared to show a CNN staffer saying the network likes Warren “a lot” and dislikes Gabbard. CNN’s own Twitter account even pointed out that Gabbard received less time than other candidates. According to CNN itself, Warren spoke for over 22 minutes, followed by Biden’s 16-plus minutes, while Gabbard only spoke for roughly eight minutes.

Following the debate, Gabbard’s sister criticized CNN via a tweet sent by the candidate’s verified account that accused the network of cutting off Gabbard to “protect Warren.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

“It was no surprise that CNN began with almost 20 minutes talking about impeachment and defending the Bidens seeing as how CNN's been obsessed with impeachment for at least three years now,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News.

“Between cutting off Tulsi Gabbard and asking far-left, leading questions on abortion, gun control, and the Supreme Court, CNN reminded America last night just how invested they are in defeating and removing the President from office,” Houck added.

Conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that the debate was harmful to candidates because liberal moderators were so easy on them.

“CNN is actually doing a disservice to the Democratic candidates and to Democratic voters by refusing to ask tough questions of the front runners,” Barron said. “Whoever the Democrats nominate will have to square off against President Trump on the debate stage and I promise you he won’t treat the nominee with kid gloves”

Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that CNN wouldn’t be a “neutral referee” because of its own bias and that was before the debate even started -- and the moderators didn’t do anything to change his mind.

DAN GAINOR: ELIZABETH WARREN DRAWS MOST ATTENTION FROM MEDIA AND CANDIDATES IN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

“CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject – one easy one for each candidate,” Gainor wrote following the debate.

CNN and The Times were also heavily criticized for overlooking China, which has been a focal point of the recent news cycle. China made headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States and the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA – but the moderators didn’t seem to care what 2020 candidates thought about the situation.

""There hasn’t been one question about China in this entire 3 hour debate. It is shameful,"" ""The View"" co-host Meghan McCain tweeted.

The ""foreign policy"" portion of the debate featured questions predominately about Trump's recent troop withdrawal from Syria as well as handling Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It's patently amazing that the network couldn't find the time over three hours to ask one question about arguably a Top-3 topic going into the 2020 election, China, but did ask as its final question of the night about the friendship between Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush,” Concha said.

Plenty of others took to Twitter to chime in on the debate, too:

Challenging night for Warren: Dems attack her on debate stage, then ‘Squad’ backs Sanders

Tuesday was arguably a bad night for rising Democratic presidential co-frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate and then reports surfaced that members of “The Squad” were set to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president. Several of the candidates during the debate in Westerville, Ohio, criticized Warren for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class. Click here for more on this story.

But perhaps the most disheartening news for Warren came after the debate. Reports said that at least three members of the “Squad” of far-left freshman members of Congress will endorse Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart attack. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., issued a statement confirming her endorsement, and CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Squad member Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., will endorse a candidate soon.

Biden insists he and son Hunter did nothing wrong, focus should be on Trump corruption

During Tuesday’s debate Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing. Biden had been at the top of the crowded field for months but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

CNN anchor Anderson Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. Ultimately, the elder Biden insisted neither he nor Hunter did anything wrong and that the focus should be on President Trump. ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on,"" he said. Click here for more on this story.

Other highlights in the debate: All of the 12 Democrats onstage backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

Sanders stood by his claim that he would provide jobs for every single American -- ""tens of millions of Americans"" - purportedly ending unemployment in the United States. Biden, Warren, and Sanders -- who is recovering from a heart attack two weeks ago -- all faced pointed questions about their age, and health and how those factors could affect their electability and potential presidency.

The simmering bad blood between rivals South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas appeared to boil over as they continued to jab at each other. At one point, Buttigieg, who has said that O’Rourke’s gun buyback proposal could hurt Democrats appeal with moderate voters, firmly told O'Rourke: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage.”

CNN and The New York Times were widely criticized for not asking any of the 12 Democratic candidates about China during Tuesday night's presidential debate. China has made making major headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States as well as the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA after the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey made a tweet in support of the Hong Kong protesters.

Doug Schoen: The fourth Democratic debate's big winner, biggest loser and two surprise showings

According to Doug Schoen, a Fox News contributor and veteran Democratic pollster and consultant, Elizabeth Warren was still the big winner in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. In his analysis for Fox News Digital, Schoen said Warren showed she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead -- and that only solidified her frontrunner status.

The biggest loser, according to Schoen, was Joe Biden, who needed to deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump. However, Schoen wrote, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Schoen said, were two surprise winners for delivering strong performances. Click here for more of Schoen's winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate.

""I don't find it shocking,"" said Lahren on the endorsement, ""and if Bernie Sanders really covets this endorsement, I think that tells you everything you need to know about Bernie Sanders,"" she said Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is set to appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally following the senator's recent heart procedure. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed.

SANDERS PROMISES NEW JOBS FOR 'TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' DURING DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Lahren said she wasn't shocked by the endorsement from the ""Squad"" for the openly socialist candidate, as many of the far-left congresswomen have previously expressed support for his policies.

""The fact that we're in a place in this country where we take any of them seriously, let alone elect them to office, is appalling,"" she said.

""The bigger problem here is that this is what's actually happening in an election for President of the United States."" — Tomi Lahren, Fox Nation host

""But at the end of the day, we know this isn't shocking or important, we knew they were going to endorse Bernie Sanders, they're all socialists, and the bigger problem here is that this is what's actually happening in an election for President of the United States,"" Lahren continued.

The endorsements came as a potential blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who, like Sanders, has been representing the party’s progressive wing.

Winning the OK of the “Squad” members was viewed as crucial in attracting young voters for the top three Democrats in the polls, all of whom are in their 70's — with Sanders at 78, former Vice President Joe Biden at 76 and Warren at 70 years old.

Reiterating her point, Lahren credited Sanders for ""calling himself a socialist,"" unlike Warren.

""The thing I'll give Bernie Sanders credit for is that he is one of the only ones...that actually calls himself a socialist...at least he's forthright about what he wants to do to this country,"" Lahren continued.

Later in the segment, Lahren highlighted her latest episode on Fox Nation's ""No Interruption,"" where she sat down with the real-life ""Wolf of Wall Street"" Jordan Belfort to hear his perspective on the 2020 candidates.

Belfort had strong words for Sanders and Warren, both of whom have called for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amok, it gets really ugly,"" said Belfort. ""What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… but the policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said in the latest Fox Nation episode.

PETE BUTTIGIEG RELEASES AD CRITICAL OF SANDERS' AND WARREN'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' HEALTH PLANS

Rising in polls and facing increased scrutiny, Sen. Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night’s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" plan.

Warren, D-Mass., has repeatedly refused to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class. During Tuesday's debate, she maintained that she would lower costs for everyone except the wealthy and large corporations. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has similarly pledged to lower costs but disclosed that his plan would entail raising taxes.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE’LL FINANCE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

After being asked by the moderators early in the fourth-round debate at Otterbein University whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health care proposal, the progressive senator from Massachusetts didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Host Sandra Smith said estimates place the 10-year cost of the ""Medicare-for-all"" plans at $32-34 trillion.

""Don't the candidates on that stage touting 'Medicare-for-all' have to explain how you pay for it?"" Smith asked.

“If you look back to the 2018 election, the American people spoke loud and clear that they wanted Democrats in power and that’s why we won back the House of Representatives and the number one issue was healthcare,” Hinojosa said.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should be worried about her own reelection chances instead of helping Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on the presidential campaign trail, Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren said on Wednesday.

“I think AOC should be far less concerned with really campaigning for Bernie Sanders. She should be worried about her own back because I think she’s going to have a more difficult time with re-election than she thinks,” Lahren said on “Fox & Friends.”

Fox News has learned that Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally following the senator's recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event.

That makes three members of the so-called “Squad” of far-left freshman members of Congress who are lining up behind Sanders for president.

""The fact that we're in a place in this country that we take any of those three seriously, let alone elect them to office, is also appalling to me,"" Lahren added.

The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who, like Sanders, has been representing the party’s progressive wing.

HUNTER MAY HAVE MADE 'MILLIONS' IN UKRAINE, NEWLY REVEALED DOCS SUGGEST

Word of the endorsements also followed Tuesday night’s Democratic debate in Ohio, where Warren was under attack from multiple candidates after rising in the polls in recent weeks.

Winning the OK of the “Squad” members was also viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens — Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70.

There was no indication that the fourth member of the Squad, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., was ready to make an endorsement — either of Sanders or any other candidate.

Lahren said the endorsements are not shocking or important to the race.

""We know that they were going to endorse Bernie Sanders. They're all socialists. The bigger problem here is that that is actually happening in an election for president of the United States.""

Rising Democratic co-frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate, as former Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

TOMI LAHREN: AOC SHOULD WORRY ABOUT HER OWN RE-ELECTION, NOT ENDORSING BERNIE

All of the 12 Democrats onstage in Westerville, Ohio, backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against Trump. The debate marked the first time the candidates met since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's news conference last month at which she unilaterally declared the inquiry had begun -- a move that the White House has said is legally insufficient.

""Joe Biden continues to stumble and bumble through these debates. Bernie Sanders came in strong. Elizabeth Warren was treated as the frontrunner,"" McDaniel said.

""I don't think you're going to see any of this narrowing down to one candidate any time soon which is great for us. And, again, the president won because he was the main topic of discussion,"" McDaniel argued.

In addition, she said that Democrats were dishonest about the positive results of the Trump presidency, citing a strong economy.

""They continue to ignore the facts,"" she told Hemmer. ""We came out as big winners last night.""

One fly in the proverbial ointment: As co-host Dana Perino pointed out, Michelle Obama has said she has no interest in running for office.

MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 'JUST NOT FOR ME'

The Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, released on Monday, indicated a three-way tie for the top spot in New Hampshire -- with Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 25 percent support, former Vice President Joe Biden at 24 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 22 percent.

But, if Obama hypothetically jumped into the race, the poll suggested she would grab 26 percent support of likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State, with Warren and Biden at 20 percent and Sanders at 15 percent.

Co-host Jesse Watters said the poll ""speaks to the weakness of Joe Biden.""

Fellow co-host Emily Compagno agreed in part, saying: ""it speaks to the weakness of Democrats in general.""

""Here's why, because it's the grass is greener on the other side. And we saw this in 2016 when they were pining after Joe Biden because they felt that he at that time better represented the Obama era,"" Compagno said. ""He wasn't getting beat up in the primary.""

""No matter what cycle it is there are always going to be pining for whoever is not there,"" Compagno added.

Perino weighed in again, saying that Biden will benefit from dealing with the Ukraine scandal involving his son Hunter in the primary if he can survive.

""Here's one thing I would say about Biden though, if he were to be able to get through this primary process and become the nominee it's much better to have had to deal with the Hunter situation in the primary than in the general election because then, by then it'll be baked into the cake,"" Perino said.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg has released a 2020 campaign ad taking shots at ""Medicare-for-all"" proponents in the Democratic field, arguing that his health plan offers more freedom by letting people keep their private insurance.

The ad, released on Monday night, featured clips of multiple commentators supporting his ""Medicare-for-all who want it"" plan. ""Mayor Pete said a 'Medicare-for-all who want it.' That seems like a much better formulation -- working towards a universal health care system but it doesn't wipe out private insurance,"" CNN commentator Van Jones says in the ad.

The video was released on day before Tuesday's fourth Democratic debate, likely an indication that Buttigieg would try and go on offense against ""Medicare-for-all"" proponents like Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

Previous Democratic debates have tended to focus on health care, which seems to be one of the primary sources of infighting among leading 2020 candidates. Former Vice President Joe Biden has borne the brunt of the criticism due to his desire to build on the Affordable Care Act enacted by former President Obama.

PETE BUTTIGIEG PROPOSES PUBLIC OPTION, SAYS IT COULD 'NATURALLY' LEAD TO 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

It's unclear how Buttigieg will address Biden but his ad mentioned Warren and Sanders by name. The spot claims that they want to abolish private insurance and suggests that labor unions might oppose Medicare for all because it would erase the previous gains they made in fighting for insurance.

Buttigieg's health plan offers a public option that includes automatic and retroactive enrollment for anyone without a private plan.

It's unclear how long Americans could maintain their private insurance under Buttigieg's plan, though, as he's already reinforced conservative fears about a public option providing unfair and ultimately destructive competition for private companies.

""If private insurers are unable or unwilling to offer better plans than they do today, competition from this public alternative will naturally lead to Medicare-for-all,"" he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed announcing the plan last month."

BIDEN SON: UKRAINE DEALS ‘POOR JUDGEMENT’ IN ‘A SWAMP’

ABC News: “As President Donald Trump continues to fill his Twitter feed and campaign speeches with attacks on Hunter Biden over his foreign business deals, the former vice president’s son defended the ethical implications of his private ventures in an interview with ABC News, but conceded taking a misstep in failing to foresee the political implications on his father’s career. ‘In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all,’ said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in—in—in many ways? Yeah.’”



Fight night in Ohio - Politico: “Bernie Sanders is recovering from his heart attack. Joe Biden is under siege, and laying into Donald Trump. And the entire Democratic presidential field has become consumed with the House’s impeachment inquiry into the Republican president. With so many candidates responding to circumstances beyond their control — and the threat of a destabilizing moment running high on a stage that’s expanding to 12 candidates from 10 — it’s raising the specter of a debate Tuesday that finally breaks the Democratic primary logjam. Not only is it the first debate since Sanders was hospitalized and the impeachment inquiry began, it also comes as many lower-polling candidates become increasingly desperate to make a mark on the campaign. At a fundraiser in Los Angeles last week, Biden acknowledged how much of the debate is out of any candidate's hands. … Biden said, ‘One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive.’”



Will Buttigieg throw elbows? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg sees a path to the top tier of the Democratic primary field, elbowing his way between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on one side and Joe Biden on the other. At the center of Buttigieg’s push is his health care plan, which the South Bend, Ind., mayor has dubbed ‘Medicare for all who want it.’ The plan would extend a public health insurance option to Americans without ending the private insurance market, an effect of the plan put forward by Sanders and endorsed by Warren. … Buttigieg also argued that his health care plan is tougher on insurance providers than Biden’s own public option proposal to build on Obamacare. ‘It turns out that setting up the exchanges has not been enough to empower all Americans to have good coverage,’ Buttigieg said.”



Beto says he need to ‘break through’ - Texas Tribune: “Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, his campaign announced Friday as he acknowledged it was more urgent than ever to ‘break through’ in the still-crowded primary. The third-quarter total is an improvement over the $3.6 million that the former El Paso congressman took in during the previous quarter, and it came despite a halt to fundraising for roughly two weeks in August after the deadly El Paso shooting. Still, the total puts him behind a majority of primary rivals who have released their third-quarter figures so far, including two leading candidates who each raised around $25 million.”



Bloomberg back to floating trial balloons - CNBC: “Mike Bloomberg might end up running for president, after all. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden’s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That’s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private. Bloomberg has signaled he’s ‘still looking at’ running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run.”



Dems on edge over cyberattacks - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee sent an urgent alert on Monday to every presidential campaign aimed at avoiding a repeat of the cybersecurity fiasco the party suffered at the hands of Russia and Wikileaks in 2016. The subject of the email was ‘Counter-Disinformation Update,’ and it was part of a regular series of communications by DNC Tech, the party’s in-house group responsible for internal security and monitoring the spread of fake news about Democrats. POLITICO obtained the full archive of DNC’s Tech’s missives to the presidential campaigns. They reveal a party struggling to combat the continued onslaught of the twin threats faced by the Democratic Party: cyber penetration from state actors abroad and the spread of disinformation about its top presidential candidates by Donald Trump and his allies at home. … It was a moment, the DNC warned, to be hyper vigilant about fake news.”



Seven years later, Warren changes tune on health care - Politico: “Seven years before Elizabeth Warren said ‘I’m with Bernie on Medicare for All,’ she was campaigning for the Senate and didn’t want to talk about single-payer health care. Running a tough race against Republican incumbent Scott Brown, the first-time candidate repeatedly distanced herself from the idea. … But during her first Senate campaign in 2012, she … dodged the question again and again, according to an analysis of newspaper reports, TV, and interviews with health care reform activists at the time. … Warren's refusal to embrace single-payer during that campaign came four years after she co-wrote an essay that called it the ‘most obvious’ solution to the nation's health care woes — though perhaps ‘politically unacceptable.’ Warren’s remarks in 2012, as well as her more circumspect attitude toward Medicare for All at the beginning of her presidential campaign, has exposed her to criticisms from the left.”



Warren strong in Q Poll, but still lags on electability - Quinnipiac University: “One day before the next Democratic debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden remain locked in a close race for the top spot in the Democratic primary, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 30 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 27 percent.. … However, on the question of electability - which candidate has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump - Biden retains his commanding lead with 48 percent saying he has the best chance, compared to 49 percent in August. While still trailing Biden, Warren has increased her support from 9 percent in August to 21 percent today. No other candidate gets into double digits.”

TIME OUT: TO THE HOLY LAND

Smithsonian: “On April 1483, a German politician named Bernhard von Breydenbach embarked on a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Breydenbach and his companions—among others, Dutch artist Erhard Reuwich—traveled at a leisurely clip, touring destinations including Venice, Corfu, Modon and Rhodes while en route. Two years after his pilgrimage, Breydenbach created an illustrated guide detailing the farflung locales he had visited on his trip. The text, titled Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam, or A Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was an instant sensation, with eleven editions in six languages published between 1486 and 1505. Now, one of the few surviving first editions of Breydenbach’s ‘15th-century bestseller’ is set to go on view at the British Museum… Giulia Bartrum, curator of German prints at the British Museum, [says] that prior to the text’s publication, ‘most of the depictions of places such as Jerusalem or Venice were totally made up.’”

BOLTON CALLED FOUL ON TRUMP-GIULIANI UKRAINE MOVES

Fox News: “Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels where she reportedly raised concerns about a July 10 meeting.

The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump’s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination. Giuliani said Parnas’ company, Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients ‘reduce and mitigate fraud’, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee’s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.”



Feds dig deeper - WSJ: “Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Rudy Giuliani’s business dealings in Ukraine, including his finances, meetings and work for a city mayor there, according to people familiar with the matter. Investigators also have examined Giuliani’s bank records, according to the people. Witnesses have been questioned about Giuliani since at least August by investigators, who also want to know more about Giuliani’s role in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates, the people said. The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and on Monday said he hadn’t been informed of any investigation. ‘They can look at my Ukraine business all they want,’ he said.”



Dems return from recess more united on impeachment - WaPo: “…Just days after suddenly embracing an impeachment inquiry of President Trump — a moment of seeming political crisis — House leaders sent lawmakers home for their scheduled two-week recess. But as Congress returns to work Tuesday, fears of lost momentum, internal dissension and dissipating interest in impeachment have mostly evaporated among House Democrats, who view the past two weeks as among the most damaging to Trump as they dig in for their constitutional showdown with the president. … But on the central question of whether Trump ought to be investigated for potentially committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of removal from office, Democrats are now largely united: Only seven of 235 House Democrats have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, and the White House position, laid out in a letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and three committee chairmen last week, has hardened the resolve of many Democrats.”

FOR THE LONG RUN

WNEP: “The Steamtown Marathon [in Scranton, Pa.] brings out hundreds of spectators each year to cheer for the runners… For the last 24 years, 90-year-old Marie Rupp has been hosting a water station for the thousands of runners that make their way through the borough. … But this year is different. After a fall, Marie went to live at a rehab facility. It would be the first marathon she would not be out cheering for the runners. That's when her neighbors stepped in. ‘We felt it very important to get her out of there for the day and bring her back to the tradition that she started,’ said Sean Osborne of Archbald. Wrapped in a blanket with a space heater for extra warmth, Marie was on Laurel Street with her neighbors as runners passed by. And while she says she is no longer in charge, her neighbors know she still calls the shots. … ‘It's exciting! It puts life in our bones,’ Marie said.”

During Tuesday's Democratic debate, Yang knocked the company while discussing Sen. Elizabeth Warren's plan to break up big tech firms like Facebook.

Warren, D-Mass., has pushed for more competition in the industry but Yang indicated that wasn't always necessary.

""Competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app,"" he said.

He also took aim at Microsoft's search engine.

""There is a reason why no one is using Bing today,"" he said. ""I'm sorry Microsoft, it's true.""

Yang's response prompted a wave of memes on Twitter -- some jokingly portraying the company as devastated by his criticism.

Seven months later, it happened again.

President Trump on Tuesday issued his second veto against legislation seeking to end his national emergency at the southwestern border, rejecting bipartisan objections to his efforts to obtain funds for a border wall. His move, announced late Tuesday night, was expected and will return the resolution to Congress. It is unlikely to garner the two-thirds majority needed there to override the veto.

In case this isn’t obvious, it’s worth emphasizing that if Trump were politically confident about his position, and certain that the American mainstream was on his side about redirecting funds in defiance of Congress’ wishes, he wouldn’t have issued the veto late at night – during a Democratic presidential primary debate.

Nevertheless, this caught my eye for a couple of reasons. The first is that Trump may yet have to veto this same measure again. As regular readers may recall, under the National Emergencies Act, Congress can vote every six months on the president’s emergency declaration. Senate Democratic leaders have already forced the issue onto the floor twice – under these circumstances, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can’t block a vote – and they’ll likely do so again in the spring.

The second area of interest is the rarity of Trump’s use of his veto pen. For those keeping score, the list of measures vetoed by the Republican is quite short:

1. March 15, 2019: Trump vetoed a congressional effort to block his emergency declaration related to border barriers.

2. April 16, 2019: Trump vetoed a measure to end U.S. involvement in Yemen’s civil war.

3, 4, and 5. July 24, 2019: Trump vetoed three measures related to Saudi arms deals.

6. October 15, 2019: Trump vetoed another congressional effort to block his emergency declaration related to border barriers.

Or put another way, Trump has issued four vetoes intended to help Saudi Arabia, and two vetoes to redirect funds to the border in defiance of Congress’ wishes.

Nevertheless, Trump is on track to have the fewest vetoes of any American president since Warren Harding, whose presidency only lasted two years (1921 to 1923)."

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s radical vision for America, so why would Sen. Bernie Sanders want their endorsement? Here's why...",2019-10-16,Fox News,"Justin Haskins: AOC, Omar back Sanders for Democratic nomination (and that's great news for Trump)",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/aoc-omar-sanders-democratic-nomination-justin-haskins,"“Squad” members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., have reportedly agreed to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. for president, a move that will boost Bernie’s chances of winning the Democratic Party’s presidential primary race while simultaneously crushing his chances of beating Donald Trump in the 2020 general election.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have won immense praise from virtually every corner of the mainstream press and among the most extreme leftists in the Democratic Party. Both have been key players in promoting the “Green New Deal,” the most economically dangerous policy proposal offered in modern American history. (Sanders cosponsored Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal resolution in the Senate earlier in 2019.)

Among other things, Comrade Ocasio-Cortez’s GND would have the country abandon all fossil fuels over just a 10 year period, eliminate air travel, kill cows to halt climate change, provide “free” college, impose a single-payer health care system, and create a federal jobs guarantee.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Or, put more simply, the Green New Deal would transform America’s economy into a government-managed socialist nightmare. No wonder Ocasio-Cortez likes Bernie so much!

The timing for an endorsement couldn’t be better for Sanders, whose campaign took a big hit two weeks ago after the 78-year-old senator experienced a heart attack that forced him temporarily off the trail and gave a big boost to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Warren enjoys a strong lead over Sanders in most polls and is seen as the primary challenger to former Vice President Joe Biden, who remains the front-runner.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s endorsement of Sanders will likely help Bernie win greater support among young socialists and progressives in the primary race.

One of Sanders’ biggest campaign weaknesses has been that although he has all the necessary socialist credentials to win a primary race in the modern Democratic Party, he remains an old, wealthy, white guy trying to win a nomination in a party currently obsessed with identity politics.

Ocasio-Cortez, a charismatic 30-year-old Latina, and Omar, 38, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, will help to improve his image among those who seem to believe age and race are among the most important qualifications for the nation’s highest office.

But whatever help Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s support will offer Sanders in the upcoming primaries, it will most assuredly be heavily outweighed by the significant political damage these endorsements will have during the general election. Among many American voters, including middle-of-the-road Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are about as politically toxic as it gets. In fact, “toxic” is probably a big understatement; they’re the Chernobyl of modern American politics.

A poll conducted by Axios of white, likely 2020 general election voters, with less than two years of college education—a demographic Democrats need to do better with in 2020 than they did in 2016 to have any chance of defeating Trump, found that although recognition of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar was high, support for both young socialists was extremely low. Only 22 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable view of AOC, and only 9 percent said they had a positive view of Omar. Yes, you read that correctly—just 9 percent.

Further only 18 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable view of socialism, while nearly seven in ten said they disapprove of socialism.

In July, Axios reported a “top Democrat … invoiced in 2020 congressional races” indicated that the internal polling data conducted of AOC was so bad that it “could put the [House] majority at risk.”

Other polling data show Ocasio-Cortez’s popularity in the toilet with other demographics as well. A March Quinnipiac survey revealed only 23 percent of Americans had a positive view of Ocasio-Cortez. Even in her home state of New York, AOC’s support is lackluster. A survey released in August found only 41 percent of New Yorkers like Ocasio-Cortez, roughly the same percentage of Americans across the country who said they have a favorable view of the freshman congresswoman.

The data couldn’t be clearer: Americans don’t support Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s radical vision for America, so why would Bernie want to tie this gigantic anchor around his neck? Answer: He’s getting increasingly more desperate now that Warren’s campaign has started to surge.

Right from the start, it was apparent that for either Warren or Sanders to beat Biden, it would likely be necessary that one of the two would need to drop out of the race sooner rather than later.

Both Sanders and Warren come from the same region of the country and enjoy significant support within the most radical, socialist wings of the Democratic Party. Although the far left has unquestionably hijacked the DNC, it’s possible there still aren’t enough socialists in the party to push either Sanders or Warren in front of Biden while the vote is divided. From now until the primaries, the goal for Sanders and Warren will continue to be to try to build enough support to convince the other to drop out.

But all this political maneuvering will come at great cost. In order for Democrats to beat President Trump, they’ll need to do what Hillary Clinton couldn’t: win in much of the Midwest, in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Endorsements from AOC and Omar might make that incredibly difficult task even more insurmountable for Sanders, who already faced an uphill battle with voters because of the unpopularity of socialism in America’s Heartland.

With each passing day, it’s becoming more apparent that the leading Democratic Party candidates are digging the 2020 hole deeper and deeper, a clear sign that they are totally out of touch with the views of most American communities. How many times will they have to lose elections before they realize that people in the Heartland don’t share the same vision for the future as people like AOC and Ilhan Omar?

Based on the current campaign cycle, it appears the answer is at least one more presidential election.

His answer was the latest apparent gaffe during his campaign. The gaffes appeared to have raised enough concerns that some allies of the former vice president reportedly suggested he scale back the number of events he did on the campaign trail.

David Axelrod, a former adviser to former President Obama, blasted that advice, arguing on Thursday that he shouldn't be cloistered as a presidential candidate.

Biden has embraced his propensity for gaffes, arguing it was better than being President Trump. “I am a gaffe machine, but my God what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can’t tell the truth,” he previously said.

The speculation surrounding whether Clinton would mount another presidential run has even caught the attention of President Trump, who took to Twitter on Wednesday to bash both Clinton and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the current Democratic frontrunner.

“I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,” Trump tweeted. “Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!”

MICHAEL GOODWIN: HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN — OR GET OVER IT ALREADY

“Don’t tempt me. Do your job,” Clinton responded.

Trump and Clinton’s latest Twitter exchange comes just a few weeks after she blasted the president in an interview with CBS, calling him a “corrupt human tornado.”

“I believe that, look there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again. And I'm hoping that both the public and press understand the way Trump plays the game,” Clinton said.

In my view, Clinton entering the 2020 race would do the party an enormous disservice. Further, given that there are still currently 19 Democratic candidates vying for the nomination, Clinton’s ability to re-clinch the nomination is a long shot at best.

However, if the former secretary of state has genuine ambitions to enter the Democratic primary race, the best way she could do so is not by blasting Trump or by being divisive.

Rather, Clinton needs to rise above the field and present a worldview that is unifying, and can bring together the two factions of the Democratic Party.

If Clinton is hoping to break through the deadlocked primary and make another run for the presidency, her best way in would be by presenting big ideas on climate, the economy, health care, and job creation.

Ultimately, the Democratic Party very well may be deadlocked, as nearly 20 candidates are seeking the party’s nomination.

Thus, if Clinton is hoping to break through the deadlocked primary and make another run for the presidency, her best way in would be by presenting big ideas on climate, the economy, health care, and job creation.

While some are arguing that there is a path for Clinton in the 2020 race, support for her third run is mixed, even within her own party.

A Rasmussen poll released this month showed that even though Clinton is running even with President Trump, most Democrats don’t want her to get into the race.

While Trump and Clinton both garner 45 percent of the vote in this hypothetical match-up, 71 percent of all voters don’t think Clinton should run again.

Moreover, 59 percent of Democrats don’t think that Clinton should enter the race for their party’s nomination, compared to 74 percent of independents and 80 percent of Republicans who believe that Clinton should stay out of the 2020 contest.

Ultimately, whether Clinton is seriously weighing another presidential run or is just bashing Trump as a way to promote her book, she is still speaking as one of the most prominent Democratic politicians in the country. Thus, Clinton should not waste her media time and influence on taunting the president.

Rather, Clinton should seize on this moment to contribute to a unifying, inclusive Democratic narrative which entails bold plans for tackling climate change, making the economy work for everyone, and fixing the broken health care system.

To be sure, even when she is out of the running for president, Hillary Clinton is still one of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party today.

However, it remains to be seen whether Clinton will use her power to move the party closer to the White House, or whether she will merely use it to tease the president as he faulters.

It is being replaced by a new Democratic-Socialist Party.

If you think I exaggerate, consider these examples.

Imagine what would have happened if any candidate in the debate had the courage (or lack of sense) to actively defend President Bill Clinton’s policies on welfare reform, capital gains tax cuts and balanced federal budgets, or his 1996 State of the Union assertion that “the era of Big Government is over.”

RONNA MCDANIEL: FOURTH DEMOCRATIC DEBATE WAS ANOTHER WIN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GOP

Imagine that any candidate had agreed with President Barack Obama’s original 2008 position that “I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.”

Or imagine that a candidate had defended ObamaCare as the solution to health care in America.

When the last two Democratic presidents can no longer be defended by the men and women hoping to become the next Democratic president, something profound has happened.

We have already seen the old Democratic Party (and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. James Clyburn of South Caroline literally represent the old Democratic Party) being eclipsed by “the Squad.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is now the spiritual leader of House Democrats. And every major Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed radical Green New Deal-type proposals that would expand government, destroy the energy industry, radically change America, and plunge the economy into a depression.

The Democratic-Socialist Party wants to outlaw private health insurance, punish the successful (especially the wealthy), and expand government control over virtually everything.

In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.

The Democratic-Socialist candidates embrace policies ranging from wanting to confiscate guns; forcing the radical California gender curriculum on every state; removing the tax exemption for every church, synagogue, and mosque that defines marriage as between a man and a woman; providing free (meaning taxpayer-funded) health care to people living in our country illegally; and opening the border so anyone and everyone will be able to enter the United States without having to worry about immigration laws.

Some of these radical candidates favor tax-paid sex-change operations in prison – and genderless prisons (one of Biden’s contributions to the dialogue) so male criminals could declare themselves female to be sent to women’s prisons.

Imagine that one of the candidates had said he or she was against abortion. The result might have been a riot – and at a minimum an expulsion of the heretic. Instead, the new Democratic-Socialist Party stands for abortion on the last day of pregnancy, and its most radical acolytes are now for infanticide after delivery as long as “the infant would be kept comfortable” (see the New York state law endorsed by the Democratic governor of Virginia).

Almost equally heretical would have been a candidate defending Columbus Day (favored by 57 percent to 29 percent of the public, with the Democratic-Socialists once again in a position favored by about a quarter of the country).

Imagine that candidate attacking the National Education Association’s pledge that “educators must acknowledge the existence of White supremacy culture as a primary root cause of institutional racism, structural racism, and White privilege. ...the Association will actively advocate for social and educational strategies fostering the eradication of institutional racism and White privilege perpetuated by White supremacy culture.”

White supremacy culture is left-wing code for American history, American exceptionalism, the rule of law, the Constitution, and the various habits and patterns that made America the most prosperous and powerful nation in history.

Can you imagine one of the candidates in the debate arguing that our schools should not be centers of anti-American indoctrination dictated by left-wing unions? Of course not. They would be booed off the stage.

As The Wall Street Journal put it in an editorial headlined “Warren and Sanders, Policy Mates.” the pattern is overwhelming:

The editorial says this about Warren and Sanders: “They both would force these companies to get a new federal charter requiring them to consider ‘stakeholders’ rather than shareholders in their business decisions. They both want to reimpose the old Glass-Steagall fence between commercial banking and investment banking. 'The business model of Wall Street is fraud,’ Mr. Sanders likes to say. Ms. Warren also thinks bankers are crooks: 'Wall Street is looting the economy.’ They agree the U.S. Postal Service should become a bank that offers government checking accounts and would compete with private banks.

“On college as an entitlement, the two again see eye to eye. 'It’s time to cancel student debt and make universal free college a reality,’ one says. The other reverses the order: 'We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free, and cancel all student debt.’ For the record, Ms. Warren’s plan is the first one.”

There are a scattered handful of traditional liberal Democrats in the House and Senate, but none have any chance of ever being a national candidate in the emerging Democratic-Socialist Party.

We are watching a historic moment in which a once-great American political party is transformed into an anti-American engine of radical change. In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.

It will be a wrenching, defining moment for the party of Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy if it is conquered by the party of AOC, Sanders and Warren.

Beto O’Rourke of Texas boiled over on Tuesday night at the fourth round Democratic primary debate.

At one point, Buttigieg, who has said that O’Rourke’s gun buyback proposal could hurt Democrats appeal with moderate voters, firmly told O'Rourke: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage.”

The two candidates have jabbed at each other in recent weeks over their differences on combating gun violence – and specifically on the merits of the mandatory assault weapons buyback program championed by O’Rourke.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR, SLAM WARREN OVER NOT ANSWERING ON HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL

Asked by the moderators at the debate at Otterbein University in Ohio how he would enforce his plan, O’Rourke answered that he expected “my fellow Americans to follow the law.”

Buttigieg, who’s criticized O’Rourke’s proposal a “shiny object” that distracts from implementing gun control steps that enjoy widespread support, argued that O’Rourke’s answer showed a lack of clarity on whether a mandatory gun buyback program could work.

And Buttigieg emphasized that “we cannot wait for purity tests…we have to just get something done.”

“This is not a purity test,” O’Rourke fired back, emphasizing that if the federal government banned the sale of assault weapons, it made sense that existing weapons need to be removed from the streets.

And he charged that Buttigieg’s “shiny object” criticism was a “slap in the face…to those who have survived gun violence, those who’ve lost a loved one to an AR-15, an AK-47.”

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

O’Rourke also indirectly suggested that was Buttigieg was being cautious on backing a mandatory buyback program due to poll testing and focus groups.

“That seemed like a fairly personal exchange,” remarked Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor.

Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee, emphasized that Buttigieg challenged anyone who questioned his boldness. ""That’s what Beto tried to do, saying ‘I’ve got the bolder idea.’ And when Buttigieg came back and said ‘don’t talk to me about boldness, don’t talk to me about courage,’ it was a very powerful moment.”

O’Rourke has made curbing gun violence central to his campaign his hometown of El Paso, Texas was rocked by a horrific mass shooting in early August.

Buttigieg’s plan to reduce gun violence calls for universal background checks, implementing ""red flag"" gun laws, and banning the sales of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

With the spate of mass shootings in recent years, curbing gun violence has been a top issue in the Democratic presidential nomination race."

Once again, the debate stage showcased a lackluster group of extremist politicians pandering to their far-left base of support with harmful policy proposals that are way outside the mainstream.

The three septuagenarian candidates currently making up the top tier of the Democratic field include a confused and corrupt former Vice President Joe Biden some 20 years past his prime; unelectable socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who recently suffered a heart attack; and hopelessly out-of-touch former Harvard professor and current Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who wants to throw 180 million Americans off their private health insurance plans, including union workers.

Stuck with a field marred with enormous electability questions, no one is paying closer attention to the weakest field of presidential candidates in recent memory than 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

These two nationally recognized liberals are likely thinking the same thing as everyone else: none of the 12 mediocre candidates on the stage in Ohio Tuesday night has what it takes to defeat President Trump in November 2020.

After watching the three-hour snooze fest, here are some of the takeaways that Clinton and Bloomberg may be thinking about as they consider jumping into the presidential race.

The Democratic candidates are desperately lurching farther and farther to the left. This strategy of embracing extremism is clearly designed to capture the hearts and minds of the Democratic primary electorate by repackaging the tired Big Government policies of the past. Capitalism and liberty have become dirty words with this crowd. Look no further than new reports Tuesday night that Green New Deal author and socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – along with radical Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota – plan to endorse Sanders for president. Throughout history, socialism has failed at every turn and will fail once again as the Democrat’s party platform in the 2020 general election.

Joe Biden’s son Hunter and his shady foreign business dealings were glossed over and badly mischaracterized. This should have been the big issue of the night. Serious allegations against the Bidens are being whitewashed by a biased mainstream media that has gone headfirst into the dishonesty tank during the Trump administration.

The impeachment witch hunt led the discussion because the Democratic Party has no positive agenda. All the candidates reminded viewers about the partisan nature of the baseless impeachment inquiry against President Trump by rushing to judgment before getting the facts. It’s become clear that impeachment is being pushed because desperate Democrats can’t defeat Trump at the ballot box in less than 13 months.

Democrats are offering the American people big tax increases, job-killing over-regulation, and lawless open borders. These failed and harmful ideas aren’t polling well with voters. But the far-left Democrats are so committed to Big Government that they ignore the fact that their plans would wreck the vibrant Trump economy and punish American families and businesses.

“Medicare-for-all,” championed by Sanders, is so extreme that even some of the Democratic presidential candidates oppose it. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., pointed out that the disastrous proposal would result in a “multitrillion-dollar hole” in the federal budget. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called the irresponsible plan a “pipedream.” They’re both right.

The debate will not change the trajectory of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Nothing happened to suggest someone had a breakout moment and will show real upward movement in the polls. The top tier will remain Warren, Biden and Sanders.

Despite the best efforts of Democrats, President Trump’s amazing accomplishments to improve the lives of the American people simply cannot be explained away. The national unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is at a 50-year low and the unemployment rates for women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans are at historic lows. Over 6 million jobs have been created on President Trump’s watch – including 500,000 manufacturing jobs – and a record number of Americans are currently employed. To paraphrase former President Bill Clinton, elections are about the strong economy – and continued prosperity.

In a debate that featured barely a spark – much less fireworks – there’s ample reason for Democratic power brokers around the country to be concerned about where the current overcrowded field is headed. So they might be looking for other options before the Iowa caucuses kick off voting for the presidential candidates in February.

Here’s the reality:

Job creators, entrepreneurs and investors alike know that President Trump at his core thinks like a pro-growth businessman, and that gives them confidence to make decisions that expand their businesses.

On trade, President Trump’s vision and leadership have changed opinions on how we approach China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. The president knows there is a difference between free trade and fair trade when it comes to prioritizing American workers.

In Tuesday night’s debate in the critical Rust Belt state of Ohio – as the Democrats highlighted their failed vision of tax increases, overregulation, and giving away the store to China – the contrast with the positive Trump record couldn’t be starker.

Well-known liberal egotists Clinton and Bloomberg certainly think a lot of themselves and despite their baggage could probably fare better against President Trump than the current slate of boring Democrat wannabes.

And if the Democrats really want to recreate the 2008 Obama coalition, there’s another candidate who could immediately become the party’s frontrunner due to nostalgia alone. Her name is Michelle Obama. But the problem with nostalgia is that we tend to remember what we liked and forget what we didn’t like.

The clear reality emerging at the end of the long debate was that these are desperate times for a Democratic Party suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.

In an eight-page letter sent last week to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Cipollone wrote: “Your [impeachment] inquiry is constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process. In the history of our Nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the President without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.”

""President Trump and his administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,"" Cipollone added. ""Your unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.""

WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT WILL NOT COMPLY WITH 'ILLEGITIMATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

In order to keep up the facade of outrage and paint Cipollone’s defiant letter as grounds for impeachment in its own right, Democrats have ignored the substance of the letter itself and resort to threatening administration officials who comply with the historical and legally irrefutable principle of executive privilege.

Among other things, Cipollone’s letter takes Democrats to task for calling their stunt an “impeachment inquiry” without passing any kind of impeachment resolution.

Cipollone wrote: “Here, House leadership claims to have initiated the gravest inter-branch conflict contemplated under our Constitution by means of nothing more than a press conference at which the Speaker of the House simply announced an ‘official impeachment inquiry.’ Your contrived process is unprecedented in the history of the Nation and lacks the necessary authorization for a valid impeachment proceeding.”

The refusal of Democrats to follow historical precedent regarding impeachment is not simply a matter of semantics or procedural niceties. Rather, it is a transparent attempt to run an open, one-sided, partisan pillory without granting President Trump the due process rights to which he is clearly constitutionally entitled.

The impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton established that the ground rules required by the Constitution are guaranteed. These right include allow the president’s lawyer to be present at all proceedings and “question any witness called before the Committee.”

It’s telling that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats who vociferously advocated for the rights of the accused in President Clinton’s impeachment proceedings have now hypocritically flipped the script and claim that President Trump has no such rights.

Democrats have used the cover of their press conference-declared “official impeachment inquiry” to deny Republican ranking members on each of the investigating committees their own subpoena powers, which are traditionally guaranteed for the minority party.

Even among those who accept Schiff’s collapsing Ukraine narrative and believe President Trump must be impeached, there’s a growing admission that something is very off about the Bidens’ dealings involving Ukraine.

The Democrats are in effect pretending their refusal to set ground rules creates an “inquiry” where they have unlimited powers of subpoena, with none of the secrecy requirements that justify those powers in a grand jury investigation – the analogy liberal commentators keep drawing. At the same time, the Democrats want no one to be allowed to investigate their own conduct.

Congressional Democrats’ obstinate refusal to accept these basic due process concerns, and their insistence on making Cipollone’s letter into a “constitutional crisis,” highlights Democrats’ underlying uneasiness with the facts of the case and their unwillingness to invite scrutiny of their own behavior.

There seems to be as much to blowback in Democrats’ faces as they have to throw at Trump.

We have seen increasingly shady looking interactions between House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and the CIA leaker – that so-called “whistleblower,” who has reported links to an unnamed Democratic presidential campaign.

We have also seen a renewed focus on former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter and his business dealings in Ukraine.

Even among those who accept Schiff’s collapsing Ukraine narrative and believe President Trump must be impeached, there’s a growing admission that something is very off about the Bidens’ dealings involving Ukraine. There is, as the old saying goes, “a there there.”

But Democrats want to strip Republicans and the president of the procedural safeguards and rights needed to air out all the facts – not just those convenient for the Democrats’ narrative.

Peter Schweizer, a defender of the president, wrote a recent New York Times op-ed headlined “What Hunter Biden Did Was Legal – And That’s the Problem.” Schweizer explains that “Hunter [Biden], a businessman, landed deals he was apparently unqualified to score save for one thing: his father” and that Joe Biden has been transparently dishonest about his discussions with his son about those dealings.

Meanwhile, The Intercept’s Ryan Grim, who supports impeachment, documents decades of “soft corruption” on the part of the Biden clan in a new report. Grim writes: “Democratic voters … can see the corruption in front of their eyes, and they have to decide whether that’s the argument they want to have with Trump in 2020 – or whether they want to nominate someone else who will allow the party to make the corruption argument cleanly.”

For all the talk about the political costs the president is supposedly accruing from his dealings with Ukraine, the only unequivocal loser thus far is Joe Biden. Until Pelosi and Schiff began their impeachment push, Biden was the clear frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. He’s now lost that position to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – and continues to decline.

Biden himself seems to have taken notice of this untoward development. Until Warren overtook him, Biden was by far the most reluctant of the leading Democratic presidential candidates to endorse impeachment. He clearly reasoned it was better to downplay an issue that implicated him and his family.

Only after losing his spot as the Democratic frontrunner to the impeachment-happy Warren – and suffering a downturn in support as Hunter Biden’s activities dominated the headlines – did Joe Biden himself get on the impeachment bandwagon. It may prove to be an ill-fated choice.

As President Trump correctly observed, if Democrats continue to refuse the White House’s and House Republicans’ reasonable demands for basic due process, the legitimacy of their pseudo “impeachment inquiry” will be tried in the court of public opinion. This could have potentially disastrous results for Democrats and for public trust in the integrity of Congress and our presidential elections, which Democrats clearly seek to reverse by illegitimate means such as sham impeachment proceedings.

Here are five questions that need to be asked,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-democrats-debate-five-questions,"When Democrats gather for the CNN-New York Times presidential debate on Tuesday, note there are five big “donkeys” in the room. (They can’t be elephants at a Democratic debate.)

First, the most obvious is that Hunter Biden earned $600,000 a year from a Ukrainian natural gas company. The left-wing media has done all it can to suppress questions about Hunter Biden. They correctly point out he has not been convicted of anything. Of course, given the universal agreement that Ukraine was extraordinarily corrupt (before the recent presidential election of a reformer) what would absence of conviction prove? It is close to President Nixon’s, November 17, 1973 press conference “I am not a crook” assertion.

There are two simple points about the Hunter Biden-Ukraine issue. What was his unique qualification to get that much money, which has added up to more than $3,000,000? Did his father really not know about it? Hunter has said he did tell his father, but his father has said he did not know. Given former Vice President Joe Biden’s routinely faulty memory, both could be true. However, most parents would know if their child was making $600,000 a year from a foreign company.

Second, do the other Democratic presidential candidates support Beto O’Rourke’s proposal to cut off tax deductibility for any church or other religious institution that does not recognize gay marriage? This is a boldly radical idea comparable to O’Rourke’s call for compulsory gun confiscation. How do the other candidates handle their slavish devotion to identity politics when faced with this bold but politically deadly proposal?

Third, since Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is now rated the front runner, how many candidates agree with her position that California’s public school gender indoctrination should be extended to the rest of the country? Because this is a new issue – only now emerging into public conversation – it is worth quoting a question from the recent CNN town hall.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Question: “How do you feel about schools teaching children about gender orientation and gender identity? In California, we're already starting those kinds of teachings and parents have been very upset and outraged. As a parent, I'm in full support of these teachings. How would you feel about it for the rest of the country?”

Warren responded: ""So, I believe this is about teaching children about our world. And, of course, we should teach them about our world. We should teach them about people, we should teach them about differences. So, I strongly support this. And I support doing this in age-appropriate ways from the time they're very young. I think this is part of how children learn, that we live in a world that has a lot of different folks who look different, who sound different, who do different things, who form different kinds of families and as Americans, we look at that and say, it's not our weakness, that's our strength.""

Do the other Democratic candidates agree that teachers' unions can force gender identity indoctrination on children as young as 3-years-old – and that parents have no right to withdraw their children from these compulsory classes? In many ways, this is a bigger assault on religion than O’Rourke’s tax proposal.

Fourth, do the presidential candidates agree with House Democrats, who on Sept. 26 passed the first step toward government health care for people in the country illegally by mandating a whole series of health activities, including electronic health records at the border?

Fifth, do the presidential candidates agree that House Democrats should continue to ignore the fair, open process used in the Nixon and Clinton impeachments? Do they agree that it was OK for Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to totally falsify President Trump’s words in his opening statement at a committee hearing, or do they believe it was unacceptably misleading in something as serious as an impeachment investigation?

These five questions would do a lot to clarify just how out-of-touch Democrats are becoming.

BUTTIGIEG AND O'ROURKE CLASH OVER GUNS DURING DEBATE

Castro grabbed only 8.2 minutes of speaking time at the debate – the third least amount among the record-setting 12 candidates on the stage – and didn’t score a breakout moment.

But in an interview with Fox News in the spin room following the debate, Castro vowed that he’ll fight on even if fails to make November’s cut and optimistically said he’ll qualify for the next debate.

“I’m going to keep fighting on. I believe that with hard work, we can make the next debate in Atlanta. We have about three and a half weeks to do that. So I’m going to keep working hard to get there,” he said.

Castro’s comments stand in contrast to his dire warning to supporters in a fundraising email late last week.

""I don’t say this lightly: If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign,"" Castro emphasized.

FOX NEWS' BRETT BAIER ON DEBATE WINNERS AND LOSERS

To date, eight candidates say they’ve qualified: They are – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman and progressive and environmental advocate Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

After the debate, it was hard to find a political pundit who praised Castro’s performance.

But asked by Fox News if his debate performance helped him in his goal to make the next debate stage, the candidate said, “I think so. It’s always a scramble for time with 12 people up there but I made the best use of the time that I did get. I was very sharp on issues that people care about and I think that will make a difference.”

And he touted on Twitter that “donations are coming in from all around the country.”

Castro also took aim at the media hosts for the debate - CNN and the New York Times – telling reporters in the spin room and highlighting on Twitter that there were “three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.”"

The company, FCTRY, showcased its ""AOC"" doll design through an online fundraising site, asking supporters to help finance its product along with other political action figures. The fundraiser started on Tuesday but has already surpassed its goal of $15,000, which it hoped to achieve by mid-November.

The promotional video also praises AOC for supporting a climate protest outside of then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office in November of 2018. Since becoming House speaker, Pelosi, D-Calif., has clashed with the congresswoman -- suggesting her social media following was relatively insignificant when compared with the amount of power she and other progressives had in Congress.

“It’s a free country — ideas, float them, fly them, run it up the old flag pole and see who salutes. In the end, you’ve got millionaires arguing with millionaires over who hates the millionaires the most,” the TV show host said.

The former ""Dirty Jobs"" host then segued into a story about Ronald Reagan’s acting career to further clarify his viewpoint.

“One of the stories they tell [at the Reagan ranch] is the time when Ronald Reagan just finally decided he was done doing movies,"" Rowe said. ""He was just done because he was paying 92 percent of every dollar he made on films. It was just math.”

“He wasn’t done acting,"" he continued. ""He just looked at it and did some basic calculus and said, 'Not for me anymore. Makes no sense to do this.'”

When Earhardt pondered if the wealthiest people would stop working as a result of mathematical calculations, Rowe shared a story about his home state of California.

“I live in California. I just read a report that said the exodus this year, as a result of a 13.5 percent state tax and some other tweaks to the system is unlike anything they’ve ever seen,"" Rowe said. ""I know it’s convenient — it’s fun to hate the rich and all. But in the end, they’re just people and they’re going to do the math and they’re going to go where the math is better.""

Kilmeade then joined in, pondering if the concept of free money is damaging to one’s self-esteem.

“You can’t ignore the human condition. We’re fundamentally lazy people. We have to be taught, I think, to not be lazy,"" Rowe answered. ""I’m just saying that if you give me a choice — and I don’t see myself as lazy — but if you give me a choice of the easy way or the hard way, I can’t help it. I’m going to default to the easy way. Free money? I want it.”

“My biggest concern with that kind of arguing is… once you say okay, free money, the next question has to be, 'Why not more?'”

“The book… started as a collection of stories I write for my podcast,"" he said. “My mother read them and said, 'These are very nice but it’s a rather lazy approach to writing, don’t you think? Publishing something you’ve already read.' In between each story about a famous person I’ve never met but I’m intrigued by, I tell a story of my own misspent youth. The book goes between autobiography and biography. It’s a memoir interrupted by some nonfiction stories about some famous people I wish I knew a little better.”"

The campaign started flying an aerial advertising banner over Otterbein University in this suburban Columbus, Ohio town, which is the site of Tuesday night’s fourth-round Democratic nomination debate.

WARREN, BIDEN BATTLE FOR TOP SPOT IN POLLS ON EVE OF DEBATE

“SOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS. VOTE TRUMP,” read the advertisement. The banner was visible starting at noon EST and the Trump campaign said it would fly the banner until 6:45 p.m., with a short break during the afternoon.

The Trump campaign flew similar aerial banners at the previous Democratic presidential primary debates.

The president, his re-election campaign, and the Republican National Committee have long accused the Democrats of making a “far-left lurch toward big government socialism.”

“While Democrats will use the debate stage to paint a glamorous view of their socialist agenda, Team Trump is here to expose the truth behind their job-killing policies and remind Ohioans what's at stake in 2020,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.

Project Veritas, whose founder, James O'Keefe, describes himself as a “guerrilla journalist,” built up the release on social media with an “#ExposeCNN” hashtag. The CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate is scheduled to feature 12 leading 2020 hopefuls duking it out from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio -- but the latest batch of alleged undercover recordings could indicate which candidates are preferred by CNN brass.

CNN'S BRIAN STELTER WIDELY RIDICULED AFTER BLAMING TECH ISSUES FOR BIZARRE ANTI-TRUMP SEGMENT

Fox News has not independently verified what Project Veritas says is a clandestine recording of CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker and members of his staff discussing their thoughts on the 2020 presidential race. The network has “already picked its winners and losers,” the Project Veritas narrator says.

“It's incredible that CNN is holding the debate when it's not a neutral referee, it's an advocate for the most-radical leftist policies. The Project Veritas videos are showing CNN for what it has become, the TV headquarters of The Resistance,” Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: ‘IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING’

CNN’s previous Democratic debate, a two-night summer marathon, was criticized by both sides of the aisle. Viewers complained that CNN’s format did not allow articulate answers because of time restrictions and that questions were specifically designed to create tension between candidates. “It was not CNN’s finest hour,” Poynter’s Tom Jones wrote.

CNN hosts Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper are set to moderate the follow-up event on Tuesday, along with New York Times editor Marc Lacey. But the debate comes amid another public relations headache for the network.

A person identified as CNN’s senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez, is claimed to be featured on a recording saying “Joe Biden has a problem, because his son was trading in his name.” Another CNN staffer is claimed to be heard saying the network is less fair to candidates Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar than other 2020 hopefuls.

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

“I think they like Warren a lot,” a person identified as CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra says in the video. “They’re pro-Warren for now.”

Sierra is also claimed to have said, “They don’t like Tulsi Gabbard” and detailed Cooper’s disdain for Trump. “Every day, he’s always like mocking him and stuff.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

The Project Veritas videos feature now-former CNN satellite uplink technician Cary Poarch (he was fired after the first batch of recordings were released), who secretly recorded some of the network’s morning editorial meetings. Poarch said he still considers himself a Democrat but, “spent many sleepless night” pondering the bias within CNN and hope to ensure a “free and fair” election.

“It’s very obvious. It's an unwritten rule that if you are center, center right, or heaven forbid, full-right Republican Trump supporter, then you are not welcome at CNN,” Poarch said in the second installment of videos.

Zucker is also heard pushing coverage of Kamala Harris’ demand for Twitter to suspend President Trump’s account despite admitting it wasn’t actually going to happen.

TRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT 'CNNs OF THE WORLD' AFTER FIERY NEWS CONFERENCE

“It’s not gonna happen, but it’s a good segment in the show, ‘Should Trump’s Twitter account be suspended?,’ It’s obviously what Kamala Harris has… others are talking about it. Not gonna happen, but it’s a good talk, it’s a good segment,” Zucker said.

Monday’s initial release featured recordings made by Poarch capturing Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

“I don’t care about the MSNBC event, OK? I don’t care about them. Let’s just stay very focused on impeachment,” a person identified as Zucker says in the recording on the day of an MSNBC town hall event. “We shouldn’t just pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so all of these moves are toward impeachment.”

Poarch said he decided to wear a hidden camera because of CNN's perceived bias, and said he secretly recorded Zucker’s 9 a.m. rundown conference call because the network was “pumping out propaganda.”

MAINSTREAM MEDIA SHREDS CNN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE: ‘THE CLEAR INTENT WAS TO SPARK FIGHTS’

“I noticed after… that there was a strong group-think that permeated through the halls and that everyone was onboard the ‘I hate Trump Train,” Poarch said.

Poarch said on “Hannity” during an exclusive interview on Monday night that he no longer works for CNN as a result of the secret recording.

Zucker, who began his career at NBC, rose from researcher all the way to president and CEO of NBC Universal. Along the way, he was responsible for increasing Donald Trump’s fame when he greenlighted “The Apprentice.”

Zucker and the president famously have feuded since Trump’s foray into politics, with the president attacking the liberal network on a regular basis and accusing CNN of unfair coverage. CNN has filled its primetime lineup with anti-Trump opinion hosts and the network’s White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, has made a name for himself by quarreling with members of the administration when they are available to the press.

“Its employees have been opposing the president and pushing for his removal so much that it is obvious it's the corporate position of the network,” Gainor said.

""This is a newly prosperous Middle America and it is Middle America that decides elections,"" said Varney on his Fox Nation show ""My Take.""

According to a study by Sentier Research, the country's middle class has seen a $5,000 annual increase in income under the Trump administration, totaling the median household income to approximately $66,000.

""Trump up $5,000 in three years; Bush, Obama up $1,500 in 16 years,"" observed Varney.

Varney believes the latest report will not play well for 2020 progressive candidates, who are ""unable to acknowledge Trump's success.""

""The socialists running for the presidency repeat their tired old cliches about 'the rich getting richer and you gotta work two or three jobs to make ends meet'...they can't say that tax cuts, deregulations, and cheap energy haven't brought prosperity... they can't say it,"" said Varney.

""To acknowledge that means to acknowledge the success of Trump's policies and that's something no Democrat can do,"" Varney continued.

""It's the Democrats' dilemma,"" he added. ""How do you run against prosperity?""

Varney questioned whether the Democrats' ""current tactics"" are enough to ""beat the extra money in America's pocket.""

""You call the president names, you try to impeach him, you stomp your feet and you say, 'Oh, I just can't stand him,'"" said Varney, ""but does all of that beat extra money in Middle America's pocket? And will Middle America take a leap in the dark for socialism?"" he asked.

""It's hard to imagine that we will abandon the system that's made this country wealthy just because of the president's style and tone,"" Varney continued.

Moody's report, tweeted out on Tuesday, said early signs point to a Trump victory mostly fueled by a strong economy. However, the results will depend on voter turnout.

""Our 2020 Presidential Election Models: Early signs point to Trump, though turnout is key,"" the tweet read.

The report states that Trump has the advantage in several forecast models such as the economy, personal finances, and energy prices.

""The current environment of stable to low gas prices favors Trump in his reelection bid. Moreover, the baseline forecast calls for gasoline prices to dip slightly in the year leading up to the 2020 election,"" the report reads.

THERE'S 'MATERIAL CHANCE' TRUMP WILL BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE, SAYS MSNBC GUEST

""Finances matter here as well, as voters who feel better off from real and not just nominal, wage gains are more likely to express comfort in the status quo. This measure also favors Trump.""

The report also claims Trump would win in a massive landslide if voter sentiment about their pocketbooks was the main factor that drove them to the polls.

""If voters were to vote primarily on the basis of their pocketbooks, the president would steamroll the competition, taking home 351 electoral votes to the Democrats’ 187, assuming average voter turnout,"" the document states. ""This shows the importance that prevailing economic sentiment at the household level could hold in the next election.""

Moody's said Trump's fluctuating approval ratings will not work against him and are comparable to past presidents who have won reelection. They also say a strong stock market will help the president, even if it is not directly tied to economic growth.

SARAH SANDERS: DEMS ON DEBATE STAGE KNEW WARREN IS FRONTRUNNER AND BIDEN IS 'FINISHED'

The caveat comes in the form of voter turnout. The report claims that if turnout among Democrats and independents match their maximum historical highs, Trump would lose in a tight race.

""An average of the three sets of model results suggests that if turnout of nonincumbent voters in 2020 matches the historical high across states, then Democrats would win a squeaker with 279 electoral votes to the president’s 259,"" the report reads.

""Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Minnesota and New Hampshire would all flip from Trump’s column versus our average turnout baseline.""

Moody's stated that the country's continued economic upswing is vital to a Trump victory, but also claimed America is at risk of heading into a financial downturn, as part of an impending global recession, in the next 12-18 months.

“I think risks are awfully high that if something doesn’t stick to script then we do have a recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “I’ll say this also: Even if we don’t have a recession over the next 12-18 months, I think it’s pretty clear that we’re going to have a much weaker economy.”

Moody's said they have corrected their turnout models from 2016, which caused the forecast to incorrectly predict a victory by Hillary Clinton."

Bolton told aide to alert National Security Council lawyer after meeting with Ukrainians about investigations: impeachment testimony

Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers investigating possible impeachment charges against President Trump on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. The meeting in question took place July 10, a little more than two weeks before President Trump's controversial call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Both Bolton and Hill, who were present at the meeting, had concerns about the conversation, she testified.

Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ""investigation that could implicate Biden and his son."" Click here for more on our top story.

In addition, Hill had high praise for ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Yovanovitch, who herself testified before congressional lawmakers last Friday as part of the impeachment inquiry, was recalled from her ambassadorship in May by Trump, around the same time that Rudy Giuliani — Trump's personal attorney — pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with the board of a gas company there.

Democratic dozen at fourth presidential primary debate will be a record-breaker

A really big stage is set the fourth round of Democrats' presidential primary debate Tuesday night. Twelve candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria. That means the showdown tonight will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention. The debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The Democratic National Committee's media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times. All eyes will be on Bernie Sanders, who just two weeks ago was rushed to the hospital when he suffered a heart attack.

Trump mulls idea of lawsuit against CNN over recording of network 'bias'

President Trump on Monday floated a lawsuit threat against CNN over reports that the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, launched an internal bias campaign to undermine his presidency. In a tweet posted Monday evening, Trump said, “’Project Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zucker’s (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNN’s BIAS!’ @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?”

The president’s latest gripe with CNN comes after conservative activist group Project Veritas published undercover recordings from an alleged “whistleblower” that capture CNN employees casually confirming the network's anti-Trump bias and show Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

Guy Benson: We'll get to our guests in a moment. Coming up later in this hour Congressman Adam Kinzinger will join me as well. Guy Benson show dot.com is our Web site please subscribe to the podcast if you'd like. That's Guy Benson show dot.com. We begin this hour with Senator Rand Paul a Republican of Kentucky. He has a brand new book out the case against socialism. Senator good to have you back.

Sen. Rand Paul: Glad to be with you Guy.

Sen. Rand Paul: So before we get to the book and we'll definitely delve into that I just want to ask you about your reaction. There was a statement out from the White House today from the president announcing new sanctions against Turkey the redeployment of American troops in the region to monitor what's happening in Syria and to as the president says prevent a repeat of 2014 if ISIS were to reconstitute. Do you favor these sanctions do you favor having troops in the area to possibly intervene if necessary.

Sen. Rand Paul: You know I think our founding fathers were very prescient when they assigned the role of deciding when we go to war to Congress. And so it's sort of a separation of powers issue that has gotten lost over time. But our founding fathers were very clear. You know Madison said that the executive branch is most prone to war. Therefore we delegated that power. You know we vested that power in the branch the legislative branch because they were fearful of having a president that was too powerful and too much war. And so really if people want to be at war in Syria there needs to be a big debate in Congress and that's how you determine whether something's in in one's national interest. People throw that term around loosely and say well it's in our national interest to be in Syria. And like most Americans are scratching their heads saying really to be in the middle of a five sided complicated war where some of these people been fighting more than a hundred years some of these few have been fighting a thousand years where the way we determine whether we should be there is we have a big spirited debate in Congress and the legislature decides whether we should be at war. The problem with Syria is if we had that debate I don't think anybody up here knows who would be at war with or are going to be at war with Turkey our NATO ally Turkey is allied with a Free Syrian Army which was also our ally for seven years but they're now fighting with Turkey. You've got Assad on the other side and the Russians and the Iranians and you've got the Kurds somehow in the middle. And I think one of the ironic things that you've already seen within the first 48 hours here is the Kurds are now appealing to Assad for protection. And it really is probably the best chance of the Syrian Kurds to ever have any autonomy within Syria is probably having the protection of Syrians and having an intact border between Syria and Turkey. So I think we'll see what happens but I'm very hopeful actually that the new twists and turns will lead to a negotiated settlement. I think what's prevented a negotiated settlement previously has been that the neocons and the people who want to stay everywhere forever have insisted that Assad go that we have regime change in Syria and that insistence has meant that Syria and Assad can't be any part of a negotiated settlement. So you can't have a negotiated settlement if you don't have two parties to it.

Guy Benson: OK. And look I understand your point about the separation of powers in your view of presidential power and war powers what the Constitution says but sanctions for example against Turkey. That's something that is being openly discussed and will be debated in Congress. If there were a significant sanctions package against Turkey based on what they are doing on the ground in Syria is that something that you would be willing to support if it's debated and passed through Congress. You mentioned Turkey as a NATO ally. Do you consider them an ally at this point.

Sen. Rand Paul: I consider them sort of a frenemy. I don't think they've been a great ally and I'm not big on sort of this forever commitment to everybody that's in NATO. That's why I haven't wanted to keep adding people to NATO. So no I don't think they I don't think Turkey's been a good ally in recent times. I think their purchase of Russian missiles should exclude them from any of our weapons. And so there are different ways you can try to use our leverage over Turkey to try to get them to behave in a way that is consistent with them being an ally. But the first step I think would be without question withholding weapons and I've been for withholding weapons from Turkey simply because of their purchase of the Russian missiles. This is an additional reason why I withhold weapons. I separate withholding weapons from sanctions for a couple of reasons. I think sanctions work a little more indiscriminately on the on the population of Turkey and often can turn the population of a country against America whereas withholding holding arms then really hurt anybody in Turkey. It just prevents Turkey from doing things ultimately with those arms that we disapprove of. I would have done the same with Saudi Arabia. I greatly object to the crown prince and I would have withheld arms until we got better behavior out of Saudi Arabia. But I wouldn't vote or wouldn't actually really not prefer any way. Sanctions against Saudi Arabia because I think really trade and continuing of trade unless you're at war with somebody is probably the better part of valor.

Guy Benson: Last question on this subject. And it goes to I think one of the arguments that non interventionists make and the president has made this argument as well and I think it appeals to a lot of voters which is we shouldn't be embroiled in these complicated conflicts where our interests are muddy at best. And I understand boots on the ground by the many thousands in a place like Syria is going to have a lot of detractors here in America I'm skeptical of it myself. But when you look at the Kurds these are the type of people that a lot of non interventionists say that's that's what we need people in that region taking care of their own dirty work in this case fighting and taking many casualties against ISIS with our support if we support people and they they die by the thousands fighting ISIS which I think is definitely in the U.S. broader interest isn't it. Isn't it a problem if we then abandon those people forcing them into the arms of Assad and Russia.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well see I'm not so necessarily sure that it's going to be a bad thing that they will be with Assad. I think it's actually their best time and the chance for actually having a homeland unless the U.S. is going to send 10 20 30 40 50 thousand troops over there to create a homeland form and guard them against everybody from around there. So no I don't think it is in their best interests but my obligations to the Constitution and I think it's complicated in the sense that people think go Kurds or Kurds well they're Turkish Kurds who are Iraqi Kurds and are Syrian Kurds. They don't necessarily all like each other. They have different political parties. The Syrian Kurds primary political arm is socialist and has been terrorist within Turkey and they do want part of Turkey they want part of Turkey to be split off into a Greater Kurdistan and Turkey objects to that. They've been fighting over this issue for 50 60 70 maybe even 100 years. So I think we have to look at it that way and decide. But also I think we have to ask what is the best chance for the Kurds. People have written these ridiculous things saying oh the Kurds have been fighting our war for us what a bunch of hogwash. The Kurds have been fighting for their villages and for their towns and for their women and for their families. And we help them but that doesn't mean that we said oh yeah we've been helping you fight against these terrible people ISIS What Should Be thank you not oh we're now so mad that you're not going to stay forever and create a country for us. President Trump said that he would help the Kurds with ISIS to defeat ISIS. We did. And so really the answer should be not oh yo you ungrateful people you won't help us forever it should be thank you so much for helping us kill these awful people we now control these villages but we're in the middle of a country that we're going to have to deal with. And I don't think the Kurds are physically able nor are we ever going to carve out a region of Syria and say This is yours. But there is a semi-autonomous area within Iraq that is working that should be the model. I think if they work with the host government which is Assad for better or worse the war is over people then go. What are we going to do keep battling on. And what would we have done if Lindsey Graham and Hillary Clinton had gotten their way and the Sunni extremists had won in Syria would we be better off. No I think they would have been a calamity for al-Qaeda and al Nusra to win the war. Assad is a bad guy but I think Al Nusra was worse.

Guy Benson: Yeah I mean and that's certainly debatable. I mean one of my biggest concerns is about ISIS. Some of these guys high value guys escaping and reconstituting and at some point posing enough of the threat where America feels like Okay now we have to go back in. But Senator we'll put a pin in that discussion because it's ongoing I want to talk about your book The Case against socialism it's brand new. You had a bit of let's say an eventful appearance on The View this week. I'll play briefly cut 24. This was an argument that Ana Navarro made about socialism and Venezuela. Listen. Well if you vote for a socialist you might get socialism.

Video Clip: Come on. Don't do that.

Guy Benson: And then she says Maduro is not a socialist. He's a corrupt murderous thug who is starving his people. Just if you would Senator. This came as news to me that Maduro isn't a socialist of course he's a socialist and when socialism often is fully implemented you get messy bloody ugliness throughout history all over the world. But what about maybe a kernel of truth in her argument which is there are forms of maybe social democracy that I oppose but are not the type of corrupt violent socialism that we see in a place like Venezuela that some of the American socialists would aspire towards as opposed to the disaster in Caracas.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well we certainly get to that. But her first point is about Venezuela. She's saying Maduro is a thug and a murderer but not a socialist and my response had she let me speak was that. Can't you be both. Can't you be both a socialist and a thug and it's even more than that. One of the themes of our book The Case against socialism is that perhaps it's not just an accident that you get violence and accident that you get thuggery. Maybe it's an inevitability that if you try to completely socialize things if you tried to appropriate the property or the farms and the businesses that ultimately you can't really do that with a kinder gentler dictator. It takes a ruthlessness if you really want to have full and complete socialism. It does take that ruthlessness. You're right. They look at Scandinavia and they say oh well what about democratic socialism in Scandinavia. Well they've got it all wrong. Scandinavia is not socialist in fact the prime minister of Denmark said to Bernie Sanders Pipe down you know we're not socialist you're you're bad for business we don't want the world to think we are socialist. And when you look closely at Scandinavia which my wife and I did in this book what you actually find is they are a welfare state with a lot of so-called free stuff sort of the freebies of socialism. But the interesting thing is what what Bernie Sanders says is a big lie. He says the rich will pay for all of these things if we bring it to America in Scandinavia. The working class pay a 25 percent sales tax and the middle class pays 60 percent income tax. So the dirty little truth about sort of big welfare states.

Guy Benson: Say that again is the middle class pays 60 60 percent income tax.

Sen. Rand Paul: 60 percent income tax starting at around sixty thousand in Scandinavia. So you have these enormous taxes on the middle class and a 25 percent tax on everyone. But that's you know when you talk about a burden as far as your income the poor and the working class paying a 25 percent sales tax is a big burden for the poor. So you can have the so-called welfare state of Scandinavia. It's not socialism but you can have that big welfare state but you cannot have it by just taxing the rich. That is the big lie Bernie and AOC is they say oh we're going to tax the rich. There's only a few of them anyway. They don't have any votes. You know nobody will care. And this is a demagoguery that we have to expose because in reality Scandinavian welfare ism is supported by massive taxes on the working class and the middle class.

Guy Benson: And would that be your criticism of Elizabeth Warren as well because she's trying to distance herself from Bernie saying I'm not a socialist. Into my bones on the capitalists but a lot of her policies look awfully similar to Bernie's.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well she's more Medicare for All which basically would cost 60 trillion dollars. Where's the money going to come from. Some reporters have begun asking her are you going to tax the middle class. Bernie at least admits that he's going have to tax somebody but you'll save a lot of money on the free insurance. Elizabeth Warren has been unwilling to answer the question but it is an important question where's the 60 trillion coming from with Bernie and I see the problem is they say they're going to tax people but what they propose for taxes is not nearly enough to pay for their you know their dreams of this paradise. They want to create.

Guy Benson: Less than a minute to go. Let me pick up on Medicare for All or single payer health care from your perspective as a medical doctor what's the moral case not just the what will it cost price tag issue what's the moral case in your eyes as a doctor against government run health care.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well leads to shortages it leads to terrible quality and leads to doctors you know selling meat out of the back of an ambulance. We tell that story in our book The Case against socialism. So it just doesn't work practically. But it's also this idea that Bernie seems to put out there that somehow he has a right to a doctor services or a nurse's services and that really is an immoral notion to believe that anyone has the right to someone else's labor.

Guy Benson: Senator Rand Paul a Republican from Kentucky. His new book just out the case against socialism Senator thank you. Thank you. We will step aside and be right back as the guy Benson show continues."

Elizabeth Warren has made a name for herself by being the candidate who has a plan for everything. That is precisely why people have taken notice of the fact that the one area where she hasn’t proposed a plan is health care. The speculation has been that, while she is vigorously supporting Medicare for All during the debates, she is leaving the door open to support other plans down the road if that position becomes a liability.

Immediately after Warren announced her candidacy, she stated that the goal was universal coverage and that there were many paths to get there. Following the September debate in which she defended Medicare for All, she said that she supported a lot of plans.

Asked if she will present her own health care plan, @senwarren says she already supports Medicare for All: ""This isn't some kind of contest"" #DemDebate https://t.co/Ffui0utwux pic.twitter.com/dIhqHZxGTK — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 13, 2019

But once again on Tuesday night, Warren repeated her vigorous defense of Medicare for All. Given that she has now done so in every debate, Walter Shapiro suggests that she might not be able to pivot.

In fact, the arena where Warren has been uncharacteristically vague is in failing to provide full details of her “I’m with Bernie” support for his Medicare for All. Her stance on the issue could be risky (particularly as she must win over upscale voters who might not want their private health insurance to be abolished). But, worse still, if Warren were to retreat now, it would seem like a patently political move rather than a principled one—which would undermine what makes her campaign so unique.

The candidate who has offered the best challenge to Medicare for All in the debates has consistently been Pete Buttigieg, with his “Medicare for All Who Want It” proposal. Here is how it is described on his web site.

Through Pete’s Medicare for All Who Want It plan, everyone will be able to opt in to an affordable, comprehensive public alternative. This affordable public plan will incentivize private insurers to compete on price and bring down costs. If private insurers are not able to offer something dramatically better, this public plan will create a natural glide-path to Medicare for All. The choice of a public plan empowers people to make their own decisions regarding the type of health care that makes sense for them by leveling the playing field between patients and the health care system. It gives the American people a choice and trusts them to set the pace at which our country moves in a better direction on health care.

Back in February, Warren said that “There are multiple bills on the floor in the United States Senate. I’ve signed onto Medicare for All. I’ve signed on to another one that gives an option for buying in to Medicaid. There are different ways we can get [to universal coverage].” But in Tuesday night’s debate, Warren referred to Buttigieg’s proposal as “Medicare for all who can afford it” and said that she would never support such a plan.

At this point, Warren is pretty much locked in to the Sanders Medicare for All plan. It grows increasingly difficult to imagine how she can back away from that position without destroying the image she wants to convey of herself as a “fighter.”"

While there are some legitimate concerns that can be raised about Medicare-for-All on the merits—as opposed to on the politics—I am not convinced that it’s a problem that some people, like members of organized labor, have worked hard to negotiate good private health care plans. To me, this is a bit like arguing that we don’t need to eliminate Lyme disease because we can treat it with antibiotics. There is simply no value-added by having a profit or commercial basis to health insurance. If it is to exist at all, it should be strictly as a supplemental product.

But that’s an ideological opinion of mine and not a strategic analysis of what the Democrats should be pursuing on the health care front during the 2020 campaign. Watching the CNN debate on Tuesday night, I agreed with Warren and Sanders on the merits, but I thought the moderates had the better argument.

I have three concerns about pushing for Medicare-for-All right now. The first is that it’s obviously controversial and has big political vulnerabilities. Sanders freely admits that to pay for it will require taxes to go up on everybody who pays taxes, including the middle class. Warren is more reluctant to acknowledge this, although she doesn’t outright deny it. What they both argue, instead, is that overall costs will go down for the middle class because they will no longer have to pay premiums, co-pays, or out-of-pocket costs. This is most likely true in a general sense, although on an individual basis it might depend on how much health care someone uses in a given year. So, one problem lies in convincing people that a tax hike will benefit them, especially when it is not guaranteed that it will.

Another problem is the same one we see anytime health care reforms are proposed. People freak out about losing plans or access to doctors they like or having to wait in a queue to get treatment. This vulnerability isn’t avoidable or a good argument for not pursuing reforms but it does make it risky to propose something as disruptive as the abolishment of all private insurance. For me, this means that you should never propose something like this unless you’re serious about putting all your muscle behind it. And that gets to my third concern.

There is a basic cost-benefit error here. The chances of pushing a Medicare-for-All plan through the next Congress are almost nil. The Democrats would either have to overcome a Senate filibuster or they’d have to eliminate the legislative filibuster altogether. Let’s examine both of those scenarios.

The Democrats would need 60 votes to end a filibuster and they couldn’t get that many votes even if they won every competitive or semi-competitive Senate race next year. So, we can rule this out.

To end the legislative filibuster, they’d need 50 votes and the vice-president breaking a tie. But the Democrats will be lucky to have more than 51 or 52 seats even in a total landslide election. The problem here is that they’re unlikely to have enough unanimity in their caucus to end the legislative filibuster unless they can get closer to 55-57 seats. That’s both because senators are institutionally opposed to the change and because moderates get two valuable things out of the filibuster. First, it prevents radical legislation from passing which would endanger their political careers. Second, it puts them in the strongest negotiating position because they are the ones who can cut deals with Republicans (or so they like to think).

So, it’s not likely that the legislative filibuster will be eliminated by the next Congress. If it is, it will probably be after the first and most important year when even the moderates have to acknowledge that the rule is crippling their new president.

So, on a cost-benefit basis, there are easily identifiable downsides to proposing something that makes people apprehensive and that can be easily attacked and mischaracterized. What I can’t find is the upside. Where is the benefit in proposing something you won’t be able to enact?

And it’s not just the filibuster that makes it hard to enact. It’s also the lack of unanimity about it in the Democratic caucuses. I’m not at all certain that Nancy Pelosi could pass Medicare-for-All through the House. In the Senate, there could be a dozen or more Democratic senators who would never sign off on it. If the idea is to move the Overton Window to make Medicare-for-All more popular, that’s the job of a message candidate, not a candidate who plans on being the nominee.

This lack of unanimity was definitely on display during the debate last night when candidates like Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar all attacked Warren for proposing Medicare-for-All. That footage will be manna from heaven for Donald Trump or whoever runs in his stead next year. We can be angry about Democrats echoing Republican talking points, undermining support for Medicare-for-All, prattling about budget deficits, and giving ammunition to the GOP for the 2020 campaign. But we can also be angry that we have serious potential nominees who couldn’t predict these problems and avoid them.

What’s particularly annoying is that if Sanders or Warren were to become president, they’d probably struggle to pass the plans proposed by Biden and Buttigieg and be accused of Leninism for even trying. That’s the best they could hope to do, and they’d be exceeding my expectations if they succeeded. So, all this is is a big fat political weakness that has no discernible upside at all.

And I simply can’t understand why anyone would gift a person like Donald Trump something he can grab and beat them with. It’s dumb politics and for once the moderates have the better side of an argument."

A longtime shareholder in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold his stake and published a laundry list of complaints about the legendary investor.

A longtime shareholder in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold his stake and published a laundry list of complaints about the legendary investor and his conglomerate.

David Rolfe, the investing chief of Wedgewood Partners, dumped his stock after more than 20 years, according to his third-quarter letter to clients. He blamed Buffett's failure to capitalize on gains in several stocks, bad investments, and reluctance to deploy his vast pile of cash.

""Thumb-sucking has not cut the Heinz mustard during the Great Bull Market of 2009 – 2019,"" Rolfe said in the letter. ""The Great Bull could have been one helluva of an astounding career denouement for Messrs. Buffett and Munger,"" he added, referring to Buffett's partner Charlie Munger.

Buffett missed out on multiple ""layups""

""A few stocks stand out to us as considerable head-scratcher errors that should have been in Buffett's wheelhouse, and should have been good for Berkshire shareholders,"" Rolfe said.

He highlighted Mastercard's 1,521% gain and Visa's 1,137% gain between the start of the bull market on March 9, 2009, and the end of last month. Then he bemoaned the fact those two stocks together make up just 1.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. ""The current combined weighting should be 15.00%!""

Rolfe also pointed to Costco and Microsoft as missed opportunities.

""Buffett has had at his disposal unrivaled expert tutelage on each company in his hind pocket for years — but to no shareholder avail,"" he said, spotlighting the fact that Munger has been a Costco director for 22 years. Yet Berkshire Hathaway only holds a ""whopping"" 0.55% stake, Rolfe added, meaning it's largely lost out on Costco's 522% gain during the bull market.

Rolfe also criticized the so-called Oracle of Omaha for not cashing in on Microsoft's 657% stock gain over the same period, despite his close relationship with Bill Gates, the technology titan's cofounder.

""Buffett probably spends more time talking with Gates (Gates Foundation and bridge playing too) each day than he does with key Berkshire vice-chairman employees Ajit Jain and Greg Abel,"" he said.

""If Buffett can endeavor to figure out the business models of both Apple and IBM enough to pour multi-billions in stock purchases, then figuring out Microsoft's business model under sensei Gates should have been Remedial Technology 101.""

Berkshire made several bad investments

""Recent billions in capital investments in notable mistakes such as IBM, Lubrizol, Precision Castparts and Kraft do not inspire confidence that Buffett & Co. are still at the top of their game,"" Rolfe said.

Buffett bought almost $11 billion worth of IBM stock at an average price of $170 in 2011, according to CNBC, only to sell his stake in the computing giant at a loss last year. He shelled out nearly $10 billion to buy Lubrizol in 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported, then later learned one of his lieutenants at the time bought a $10 million stake in the chemicals firm before recommending it to Buffett, according to the Guardian.

Berkshire Hathaway bought Precision Castparts at a $37 billion valuation in 2016, dwarfing the industrial manufacturer's $1.5 billion in annual earnings. The industrial manufacturer's profits have been lower than projected, Buffett said at his company's annual shareholder meeting in May. Buffett also admitted to CNBC he paid too much for Heinz to acquire Kraft, and the combined group's shares have plunged amid sales declines, accounting issues, and a $15 billion write-down this year.

Buffett hasn't put his cash to work

""Berkshire's current Breaking Bad-style cash hoard,"" Rolfe said, ""continues to be a considerable impediment of growth, rather than our previous hard expectation of a valuable call option on opportunity in the hands of one of the most elite capital allocators extant.""

He criticized Berkshire Hathaway for neither sharing its more than $120 billion in cash with investors nor plowing it into the market. ""Buffett seems to abhor returning 'capital paint' to shareholders while his Berkshire canvas is still 'in paint,'"" he said. Putting the cash to work ""will be paramount if Berkshire Hathaway is to once again regain their former status as a meaningful grower over just baseline US GDP growth.""

Rolfe ended by signaling his faith in Buffett could still be restored.

""Any future conviction of ours in Berkshire Hathaway shares will closely mirror that of Buffett's own conviction in Berkshire share buybacks.

* There was a lively Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio, last night. The next gathering will be in Georgia on Nov. 20.

* Bernie Sanders hasn’t picked up many congressional endorsements for his presidential campaign, but he’s now picking up two fairly high-profile backers: first-year Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

* Joe Biden’s campaign appears to have a rather serious financial problem: as the 2020 race enters the next stage, the former vice president only had about $9 million cash on hand as of two weeks ago. In contrast, Bernie Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank, Elizabeth Warren had $25.7 million, Pete Buttigieg had $23.3 million, and Kamala Harris had $10.5 million.

* With only three weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) tied with state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), with each garnering 46% support.

* On a related note, Bevin’s fate is reportedly of keen interest to the White House, and Team Trump is reportedly “planning an 11th-hour push to stave off an embarrassing defeat” for the far-right governor.

* And speaking of the Bluegrass State, a judge yesterday sided with the Kentucky Democratic Party and ordered State Board of Elections to keep 175,000 purged voters on the state’s voter rolls.

* In Maine., the latest survey from Public Policy Polling found Sen. Susan Collins (R) trailing a generic Democrat in next year’s U.S. Senate race, 41% to 44%. The incumbent Republican hasn’t yet officially declared whether she’ll run for another term.

* In a newly released audio recording, Texas state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) is heard telling a far-right activist that Donald Trump is “killing” the party “in the urban-suburban districts.”

* And though the president’s GOP primary rivals stand no realistic chance of success, it seemed notable that a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll found former Gov. Bill Weld with 14% support in New Hampshire, up from 3% in the same poll last month."

The three companies are looking to settle the litigation with a collective $18 billion payment over 18 years, sources told WSJ. The settlement would serve as a sweeping resolution to a collection of lawsuits and keep the drugmakers from bankruptcy.

On the roster: Welcome to the Thunderdome, Elizabeth Warren - Pelosi still not biting on impeachment vote - Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Bevin recovers in Kentucky poll - Sláinte, Mr. Bradley



WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME, ELIZABETH WARREN

WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose steady stream of plans have propelled her to the top of the Democratic presidential field, came under sustained attack for the first time during a raucous primary debate here Tuesday that revealed Democrats’ ongoing public struggle to define their beliefs and choose a standard-bearer to take on President Trump. Warren (Mass.) faced direct challenges from several of the 11 other candidates onstage, who took her on over her policies, her fitness to serve as commander in chief and her willingness to question the motives of Democrats who support less transformational ideas. … The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday’s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. Former vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing… Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble.”



Klobuchar, Buttigieg shone through - National Review: “The October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise, in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up, smelled the coffee, and brought their A-games: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls, this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate. But in a way-too-long, often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment, Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out.”



Sanders and Warren have deep pockets as Biden burns cash - AP: “Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don’t just lead the Democratic presidential primary in fundraising. They’ve stockpiled millions more than their rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who burned through money at a fast clip over the past three months while posting an anemic fundraising haul. Sanders held $33.7 million cash on hand on his third-quarter fundraising report. Warren had $25.7 million during the same period, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg came next $23.3 million. Biden, meanwhile, held just $8.9 million, a small fraction of what his leading rivals have at their disposal. With the first votes of the Democratic contest just months away, the candidates are entering a critical and expensive period when having an ample supply of cash can make or break a campaign. Biden’s total raises questions about his durability as a front-runner.”



Squad to endorse Sanders - Fox News: “Three members of the so-called ‘Squad’ of far-left freshman members of Congress are lining up behind Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a ‘Bernie’s Back’ rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed. In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. … The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren…”



Steyer spending stupendous - WSJ: “Billionaire Tom Steyer appeared on the Democratic presidential debate stage for the first time Tuesday night, but voters in early states have already seen him on TV thousands of times. Mr. Steyer, who new federal filings show has poured nearly $48 million of his own money into his long-shot bid, is dominating television screens in the first four states that will hold nominating contests early next year. Since entering the race in July, Mr. Steyer has spent more than $26 million on TV ads, airing more than 53,000 spots in markets that reach Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. All told, that is more than six times as many as the rest of the Democratic field combined.”



THE RULEBOOK: DEMOCRACY AND CHILL

“Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 21



TIME OUT: AN INVENTOR’S SLAP SHOT

Smithsonian: “Invented by Frank Zamboni, the eponymous ice-clearing machine celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. He applied for his first U.S. patent in 1949, for this innovative idea that totally transformed winter sports by giving chopped-up ice surfaces a fresh-frozen smoothness in a matter of minutes. ‘At the time, he was just trying to address a need of his,’ says Frank Zamboni, the inventor’s grandson and now president of the Zamboni Company. ‘He saw a need for the ice rink he owned with his brother and cousins… Instead of taking 1 1/2 hours to clean the ice, that was time somebody could be paying to skate on it.’ Contrary to popular belief, the Zamboni machine was not invented in Canada—the place of snow and ice—but in Southern California—the land of sun and fun. … As time went on, he saw a need to quickly clean the ice, so he started improvising with war-surplus equipment.”

PELOSI STILL NOT BITING ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders will hold off on a full House vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be ‘reassessed at some point.’ The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. Trump, White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. But Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son — potentially at the risk of losing U.S. military aid.”



Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Gallup: “Public opinion on whether Trump should be impeached remains mixed, but Americans now lean slightly more in favor of impeachment and removal from office compared with where they stood in June. Currently, 52% say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46% say he should not be. This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller's investigation.”



Staffers fear White House seeking scapegoat on Ukraine call - NYT: “President Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it. Even as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials’ actions around Mr. Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower’s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power. The lawyers’ inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.”



Mulvaney emerges as key figure in impeachment probe - WaPo: “In late May, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting that stripped control of the country’s relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department. Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kiev to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump. The work of those ‘three amigos,’ as they came to call themselves — diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary Rick Perry — has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing before an impeachment inquiry in Congress.”



BEVIN RECOVERS IN KENTUCKY POLL

WYMT: “The Mason-Dixon Kentucky Poll was released early Wednesday morning, and the results are interesting. The poll shows that statewide, 46 percent of likely voters support Republican Governor Matt Bevin, while 46 percent back Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48 percent-40 percent lead over Bevin, but the incumbent has pulled into a tie with his challenger. One percent of respondents voted for Libertarian nominee John Hicks, while seven percent were undecided. The poll also shows Bevin's GOP support grew from 67 percent in December to 77 percent. He is pulling in 22 percent of Democrat respondents for the cross-over vote, while Beshear is drawing 15 percent from Republicans. Among the Mason-Dixon poll participants, Bevin led among men, older voters and rural voters. … The poll credits some of Bevin's resurgence to President Donald Trump's popularity in Kentucky and resistance to his impeachment.”



Second debate was heavy with personal attacks - Louisville Courier Journal: “Republican incumbent Matt Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear had their ugliest public exchange Tuesday at the second gubernatorial debate of the fall campaign. Throughout the discussion, hosted before a raucous crowd of supporters on the University of Kentucky campus, the two rivals called each other liars and regularly interrupted one another as they were peppered with policy questions. When moderators asked about ways they would encourage students to pursue a career in public education, including the state's colleges and universities, the conversation took a turn into the gutter. … The high stakes debate touched on health care, pension reform, medical marijuana and supporting out-of-work coal miners. But it underscored how Kentucky's race for governor this year is defined by Bevin and Beshear's enmity as much as their deep differences on tackling the state's woes.”

AUDIBLE: THANKS?

“[Amy Klobuchar] had some smart answers. I’m starting not to care that she is brutal to her staff.” – Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, writing in Politico about the Democrats’ debate.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If Trump is impeached and the Senate is mad at him, votes him out, then the GOP could have a primary too. That would take up a lot of news from the Democrats. I think we need a law for 6 months of elections, period.” – Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.



[Ed. note: It would be a comfort to have such constraints, it’s true. But our Constitution just wouldn’t allow for it. The government can’t tell people when they can talk about issues, therefore there’s no way to keep candidates from campaigning and reporters from reporting. I’m increasingly in favor, though, of doing away with primary elections. Our 40-year experiment with them has been a miserable bust and has unnecessarily prolonged our election calendars. Bring back conventions and spare the American people!]



“I have pretty much come to the opinion that two things will happen…one, the 2020 election is not going to be over on election night (owing to huge court battles to follow many very close races) and…two, at some point our Agitator-in-Chief is going to leave office of his own volition…having become tired of the battle and wanting to go back to his business dealings and such. What say youse (that’s a Michigan (born & raised there) UP term)?” – Rick Randell, Bradenton, Fla.



[Ed. note: I say that I know better not to say, Mr. Randell! I think there are lots of potential scenarios for 2020 that could still be in the offing. We may yet see a landslide or even, dare I say, a political realignment. As for Trump leaving early, it’s pretty hard for me to fathom. I doubt he’d give his enemies the pleasure.]



“I miss Chris’ input during events like the debates on Twitter. I understand why he left, and it is best for his happiness. But there were so many Whhhooo Doogie moments last night, I would have loved watching it with him. But since I have found Fox Nation I can see his more candid takes on the events of the day. I just cannot interact with my clever comments! I would love to have him join The Dispatch so he could participate in the discussion groups. I will send them a note to suggest his inclusion! Thank you for being so glorious. (Sorry about the Cardinals, but Charles is happy!)” – Polly Barrett, Waco, Texas

SLÁINTE, MR. BRADLEY

HuffPo: “A man in Dublin, Ireland, decided to inject a little humor into his funeral Saturday by playing a prank on his loved ones. Shay Bradley, a Defense Forces veteran who died Oct. 8 ‘after a long illness bravely borne’ according to his obituary, shocked then delighted funeralgoers when they suddenly heard his voice shouting from his coffin as it was being lowered into the ground. ‘Hello? Hello. Hello? Let me out!’ stunned attendees heard in a prerecorded message that also included ‘knocking’ against the coffin’s lid. … Those at the funeral can be seen giggling and wiping away tears as Bradley’s voice begins to sing: ‘Hello again, hello. Hello, I just called to say goodbye.’ His daughter Andrea Bradley told HuffPost that her father recorded the audio about a year ago — and that no one really knew about it other than her brother Jonathan and her nephew, Ben. Two days before Shay Bradley’s funeral, Jonathan Bradley decided to tell his mom and the rest of his siblings about the prank. He told them that playing the audio at the funeral was his dad’s dying wish.”

This was good news, you see, because it shows she’s the real front-runner. Forget that Biden guy.

“Warren’s Charmed Campaign Just Entered a Brutal New Phase,” warns Politico.

Except, well, it wasn’t really that brutal. The disagreements at Tuesday’s CNN/New York Times debate were relatively civil policy spats. No one went after her character.

BIDEN DEFLECTS QUESTIONS ON SON AS CNN ANCHOR HITS TRUMP'S 'FALSE ACCUSATIONS'

What’s more, the candidates challenging Warren are also-rans, mired in the single digits. So that lessens the impact of those exchanges.

Two of them had very good nights. Amy Klobuchar, shedding her Minnesota Nice approach, repeatedly challenged Warren, the first to point out that her Medicare for All plan would boot 150 million Americans off private insurance. I don’t know why the moderators don’t stress that, because Warren is outplaying them in one debate after another.

Marc Lacey of the Times tried three separate times to get Warren to concede what Bernie Sanders already has, that middle-class taxes would rise under her plan. And three times Warren deflected the question by saying the rich and big corporations would pay more for health care and the middle class would pay less, evading the tax question entirely.

It took Pete Buttigieg to call out Warren for failing to answer a simple yes-or-no question. He had perhaps his best debate of the campaign, making an eloquent pitch for moderate ideas. And his strongest moment came in an exchange on Beto O’Rourke’s gun buyback program, when he said: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.” Buttigieg, of course, is an Afghanistan war veteran.

On the other hand, he only whacked Beto, who’s going nowhere fast.

Politico’s lead story says: “The candidate who brags about having a plan for everything was pilloried for not detailing how she would pay for her most expensive proposal. She was accused — sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly — of being naive, dishonest, not adequately respecting her colleagues’ ideas, tearing people down, and failing to enact major legislation. She was attacked for believing in policies that were “punitive” and a theory of governing that was a ‘pipe dream.’”

The debate just wasn’t as rough as that lead made it sound. After all, they ended by talking about Ellen.

The Washington Post declared Warren one of its winners:

“For the first time in one of these debates, Warren found herself under sustained attack. Through a combination of debate format, Joe Biden’s leads in early polls and Warren’s unique political Teflon, she had somehow avoided it. That changed Tuesday, though. Warren was the focal point, with the other candidates all but taking their focus thoroughly off Biden. It wasn’t completely smooth sailing for Warren…but it was an affirmation that she is viewed as perhaps the front-runner now.”

Look, the reason Warren has had such a smooth ride—besides running a very good, issues-based campaign—is that the press pretty much loves her. I’ve lost track of the number of puffy profiles about how she found her voice in Oklahoma, at Harvard, as a bankruptcy lawyer, at the consumer protection agency. She is getting one-hundredth of the media scrutiny that’s been aimed at Biden, who is not a press favorite.

When that changes, you’ll know she’s the front-runner.

As for Biden, he had some strong moments, especially on Syria, but his answers about his son were weak—especially since Hunter Biden confessed to poor judgment on ABC that morning even as his dad was touting his judgment that night. Biden caught a break when Anderson Cooper followed up only once and none of the other Democrats wanted to go there.

The media consensus is that Biden had another uneven night, and he does have a tendency to trip over his words. And yet, despite poor debate reviews and having to play defense on Ukraine, he keeps holding onto his supporters.

The bottom line is that the impeachment drama will quickly drown out this debate, whose 8.3 million viewers represent another decline. There won’t be days of stories about Klobuchar or Buttigieg that might ordinarily give them a chance to break through. If either is to have a shot at becoming Warren’s main moderate rival, the Biden campaign will essentially have to collapse.

Footnote: As if to underscore my point, the dustup between Trump and Democratic leaders--with the president calling the speaker a ""third-rate politician""--bumped the Ohio debate way down on many cable news shows."

""You see Dave Chapelle and Bill Burr doing Netflix specials where they are basically flipping off the culture,"" Gutfeld said, ""which is so refreshing, but then you have this other side -- the Patton Oswalts of the world -- who are the comedy police. Who are saying that you can be funny but... you have to be funny within this progressive criteria.""

""I think it's mainly because people haven't taken aim at everyone yet,"" said Munasifi. ""I think a lot of the people who... have those types of opinions... that are more in line with censoring and deciding what you can and can't joke about... haven't had backlash aimed at them.""

He continued, ""I have seen reviews for [Dave Chappelle's Netflix special]. I know that they are largely negative, and the audience reviews are overwhelmingly positive, so there is definitely a disconnect between the few people in the media... and those critiquing and labeling these things... where people are actually laughing at it.""

Munasifi also told Gutfeld about his family background. He said his father escaped from Iraq in the 70s and met his mother, who emigrated from Lebanon, in the United States.

For the better part of the year, former Vice President Joe Biden dominated the polls and the other candidates in the race attacked him from the left, which is weird to see.

Biden still believed in law enforcement and international borders, and he opposed forced bussing, along with virtually every other American. So he was obviously one of those right-wing extremists from the Obama administration.

That's what they were telling you on the debate stage. It was bizarre.

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

Thankfully, that line of attack is over because Joe Biden's presidential campaign itself is in effect over. Nobody thinks Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee. Elizabeth Warren is the front-runner now. That's not contested. The race is now hers to lose.

So during Tuesday night's debate, her rivals on the stage decide to help her do just that -- lose.

Pete Buttigieg, South Bend, Ind. mayor: Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything ... except this.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.: At least Bernie is being honest here in saying how he is going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Joe Biden: I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one in this stage that has gotten anything really big done.

Klobuchar: And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.

Biden: I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it.

Klobuchar: I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

Beto O'Rourke: Sometimes, I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

She is punitive? When Beto O'Rourke, Mr. Armed Federal Agents Coming to Your House, calls you out for divisive attacks, it's time to pay attention. And in fact, he does make a fair point.

The main reason Warren has surpassed Bernie Sanders in the hearts of primary voters despite pretty close economic programs is that she is the one far more willing to descend into the filth of identity politics.

Bernie is an ideologue. There are some things that he just won't say. Elizabeth Warren will say anything.

Recently, she tweeted this: ""Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. And that starts with using correct pronouns. I'm Elizabeth. My pronouns are she/her/hers.""

In case you were wondering -- in case there was any question at all -- that kind of posturing is central to Elizabeth Warren's campaign. She is happy to tell you, and often does, that you're worth less, or you're worth more, based on how you were born.

Unfortunately, that works right now in the Democratic Party.

One thing Elizabeth Warren is not willing to say, however, is how much her single-payer government health care plan will cost -- trillions of dollars, obviously. Nobody disputes that. Nobody disputes that.

And in fact, as a mathematical matter, there's no way to raise that kind of money without hiking taxes on the middle class. It's simple arithmetic. And yet for some reason, Warren refuses to admit that.

Marc Lacey, national editor for the New York Times: You have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan ""Medicare-for-All."" Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: So I have made clear but my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.

Lacey: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been ""evasive"" about how she is going to pay for ""Medicare-for-All."" What's your response?

Buttigieg: Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.

Save that tape.

There are a lot of moments in debates that seem like a huge deal at the time. Everyone is yapping about them. But in the end, it turned out to be completely meaningless. This is not one of those moments.

Health care is always at the top of voters' concerns and so are taxes for that matter. If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

Even a post-debate MSNBC panel acknowledged as much.

Claire McCaskill, former U.S. senator: I thought she seemed a little petulant at times when she was being challenged.

Eugene Robinson, Washington Post columnist: You think, a little?

McCaskill: A little.

Robinson: As Bernie Sanders says she just won't go there, and she was pummeled for it.

Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn.org: They attacked her and she was uncomfortable. She did not handle it very well.

So was it really that bad for Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday night? We'll see.

She definitely got better treatment than Joe Biden got. Journalists don't like Joe Biden. Biden has zero allies in America's ""woke"" newsrooms. Warren, by contrast, has plenty of allies pretending to be journalists.

For example, on Wednesday morning, NYU ""journalism"" professor Jay Rosen -- the guy whose name often pops up, despite no talent whatsoever -- demanded that reporters stop asking specific questions about Warren's policies.

Again, a journalism professor telling you not to ask questions. Rosen tweeted: ""The 'make Elizabeth warren say she would raise taxes on the middle class' question should be a credibility killer. For the journalists who keep asking it.""

Now amazingly, Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post agreed with that. She wrote this: ""Journalists are kindly doing President Trump's work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Senator Elizabeth Warren to declare she would raise taxes to fund Medicare-for-All. Of course, it's legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad.""

Did you listen to that? Two journalists telling you, if the answer hurts Democrats, don't ask the question. Don't tell your readers or viewers what the truth is if it increases the chances that Donald Trump could get reelected.

Is that journalism? No, it's pure propaganda. It is the definition of propaganda. Jay Rosen, journalism professor, telling journalists not to ask questions.

Unbelievable.

Elizabeth Warren during the most recent Democratic presidential debate Tuesday for going too easy on big corporations.

The “Fahrenheit 9/11” filmmaker, 65, was tweeting during the event when something the 70-year-old presidential candidate said caught his attention. Warren explained that she has a plan to combat corporations only caring about their bottom line that she calls “accountable capitalism.”

MICHAEL MOORE BLASTS PRESIDENT TRUMP AT CANNES FILM FESTIVAL

In short, the plan calls on companies to be held accountable to their employees and their local communities rather than just shareholders. Moore, who has an estimated net worth of $50 million and who Business Insider previously reported has nine homes, is typically known for his left-leaning point of view. He took issue with Warren’s plan in that it doesn’t do enough to dismantle capitalism.

“Senator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in ‘accountable capitalism,’” Moore tweeted Tuesday. “There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It’s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.”

The “Bowling for Columbine” director also took jabs at former Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg for their respective stances on healthcare at the debate.

“Joe Biden, Amy K and Pete B just boosted the Republican chances of winning in November 2020 by their passionate defense of the for-profit, capitalist-greed health ‘care’ system,” he tweeted.

The only one that appeared safe from Moore’s taunts was Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Wow! BERNIE’S BACK!” he wrote. “Fighting the fight for working people for three long hours — just two weeks after a heart attack! Jeez. Amazing!”

Sanders returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked at the debate how he could “reassure” Americans that he was up for the task.

“We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I’m going to reassure the American people,” Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. “I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., urged Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to reconsider her opinion that Twitter shouldn't ban the president from its platform.

Harris previously sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in which she listed a series of problems she had with the president's Twitter activity. When asked about the idea, Warren laughed it off and flatly rejected it at the beginning of October.

Harris apparently saw that and referenced her answer during Tuesday's Democratic debate. ""I would urge you to join me,"" she said before claiming that Trump used Twitter to ""obstruct justice.""

Harris also pointed to August's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, claiming the perpetrator was ""informed"" by how Trump used the platform.

WARREN LAUGHS OFF SUGGESTION THAT TWITTER BAN AFTER TRUMP AFTER HARRIS' CALL FOR SUSPENSION

""This is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site,"" she said. ""It is a matter of safety.""

Warren seemed to agree Trump should leave Twitter but didn't explicitly endorse his suspension. ""So look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job,"" she said.

When Harris pressed Warren on joining her call to suspend Trump, Warren shook her head and said ""no."" Harris, apparently surprised, smiled and said ""wow.""

Harris ignited a Twitter controversy in October after she alerted Dorsey to one of Trump's tweets. At that point, she had already sent her letter in which she told the company: ""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.""

KAMALA HARRIS DOUBLES DOWN ON SUSPENDING TRUMP ON TWITTER, URGES CEO 'DO SOMETHING'

She specifically pointed to tweets in which the president attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and suggested there would be ""big consequences"" for the whistleblower who reported on his call with Ukraine.

In a blog post from 2018, Twitter seemed to respond to other requests that it punish Trump for his tweets.

""Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation. Elected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society,"" the post read.

""Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate. It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions."""

The line of questioning started with Sanders, I-Vt., who just returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked how he could “reassure” Americans that he was up for the task.

“We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I’m going to reassure the American people,” Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. “I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Next came Biden—whose age has been a topic of conversation and criticism over the past several months on the campaign trail. CNN’s Erin Burnett quoted former President Jimmy Carter, who said that he wouldn’t have been able to start a presidential term at the age of 80, and pressed Biden why he thinks he could handle the pressure.

“Because I watched it, I know what the job is, I’ve been engaged,” Biden, 76, said, adding that “one of the reasons” he is running for president is his age—and with that, comes “wisdom.”

“We need someone in office this time around who on day one, on the world stage, can command respect from world leaders and know exactly what needs to be done to get this country back on track,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run this time because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before, I’ve been there.”

He added: “I will not need any on the job training.”

Biden, who has grappled with sustained critical media coverage of a string of gaffes on the campaign trail, then vowed to release his health records, along with his tax records, before the Iowa Caucuses in January—the first contest of the 2020 primary season.

“I’m the only guy who’s released anything up here,” he scoffed.

Warren, D-Mass., who is 70, brushed off her age, when asked to respond.

“I say I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” she said.

Meanwhile, President Trump, who is 73, has said he feels “young” and is ready for another term of his administration.

“I feel like a young man. I am a young, vibrant man,” Trump said in April.

Should Trump be re-elected, he would be 74 on Jan. 20, 2021—Inauguration Day. Should the presidency go to one of the elder Democrats in the field—Biden would be 78; Sanders would be 79; and Warren would be 71.

But the CNN and New York Times moderators shifted to the other end of the spectrum, pointing to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, for her young age of 38.

“It’s not fair to ask these three about their health and their wellness,” she said of the questions to Biden, Sanders and Warren. “Who is fit to serve as commander-in-chief?”

Gabbard said that she was, and further challenged the moderators to ask every candidate on the stage about their age and health—a suggestion that was ignored."

Sanders claimed Warren's ascension is a net positive for Trump and said her new position as frontrunner will rebrand her as the face of the party, to the detriment of other Democrats.

""She is the new face of the Democrat party,"" Sanders said. ""That is a great contrast for this president. And I think it sets him up very nicely for re-election in November.""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was seen by the moderators and her fellow candidates as the one to beat.

That point was evident with time allotted to each candidate. Warren had the most with nearly 23 minutes to answer questions – or about equal to what the bottom three candidates mustered, according to The New York Times.

There were some advantages to that. John Harwood of CNBC proclaimed “this debate crowning Warren the new 2020 front-runner.”

CNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'

But former CBS News anchor Dan Rather said that “the stage is more crowded than a Times Square subway stop.” And almost everyone on that stage was targeting Warren.

It didn’t go well for the senator from Massachusetts. The regular attacks often turned her into a whiny scold.

As CNN anchor John King later explained: “The candidates on the stage clearly thought it was in their best interest to go after Warren.”

Former CNN commentator Roland Martin said it even better, noting: “How do we know @ewarren is leading? She has a bullseye on her tonight.”

The Washington Post sold the debate with a headline sounding like it watched a far-more entertaining contest: “Warren faces first sustained attack in raucous debate.” At least it was right about the attacking.

The New York Times was more accurate in tone about the tedious three-hour marathon: “Warren Draws Fire From All Sides, Reflecting a Shift in Fortunes in Race.”

CNN host Van Jones reflected on the attacks, calling Warren: “Mortal. Mortal. Somebody grabbed the cape and pulled on it.” Jones explained that the “moderates” struck back, “tired of the woke-enomics.”

PBS White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor said it was a “BIG MOMENT” when the “Elizabeth Warren attacks begin.” As she described it: “Warren gives a tough stare” after “Mayor Pete Buttigieg says to Warren: Your signature is to have a plan for everything except health care.”

Even far-left Hollywood director Michael Moore wasn’t entirely happy with Warren’s prescriptions for change. He said: “Senator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in ‘accountable capitalism’. There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It’s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.”

But there was more to the debate than just attacks on Warren. There were also attacks on President Trump. Of course. CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject – one easy one for each candidate.

The result was laughably predictable – all the candidates showed that they hate Trump. The Post’s phrasing was a “unified condemnation of Trump.” Like no one saw that coming.

NBC News Correspondent Mike Memoli called the beginning of the debate “a moment of history,” adding that “1 participant may vote on articles of impeachment. 5 participants would sit as jurors in an impeachment trial.”

This is sure to please the major media that not only hate Trump but have financial interests in the impeachment. Axios reported that news outlets are “building pop-up newsletters, podcasts, and sections solely to cover the day-to-day developments of the impeachment process.” Those include Vox Media, CNN and The New York Times.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California scored one of the night’s few applause lines and news outlets went with her extreme narrative backing abortion, after she said: “And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.”

The debate was also predictably left-wing. Van Jones asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota a scary post-debate question for Democrats: “And I wonder, are you afraid that the party is going in a direction that is just going to get us killed here in the middle of the country?” Klobuchar responded about the party can “come together,” but it’s the kind of comment that will set the left and media worrying.

Add it to the amazingly quiet crowd. The Root’s Politics Editor Jason Johnson called it “the quietest audience I've ever seen in a debate.” Trump would have called that “low energy.” He’d have been right.

Even liberals weren’t always happy with all the candidates, especially the newest entrant into the race. Vox Senior Correspondent Zack Beauchamp made fun of the billionaire who just joined the campaign, but who always seems to wear the same tie. “While Tom Steyer wasted an unconscionable amount of money getting on stage and did absolutely nothing to justify his presence here, his tie is pretty good.”

Bustle Deputy News Editor Catherine Thompson took her own shot at his debating style: “Tom Steyer is gesticulating and speaking like he’s a ventriloquist’s dummy carved out of wood.”

But CNN had Steyer’s back. It initially listed him as a “former hedge fund manager.” That wasn’t nice enough to a guy who buys so much TV advertising. So it somehow got changed to “Businessman.”

Because CNN is neutral. And not in it for the money.

And Washington Post Opinion Writer Elizabeth Bruenig was equally critical of former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke after a few candidates were asked about their age. “i mean look. yes, as you get older, your brain gets worse. but that's just a general trend. look at beto. he's very young and his brain is very bad.”

There was one especially unusual highlight of the debate. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii bashed the “mainstream media” like she was running in the Republican primary. She explained that The “New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war.” Those news organizations were the two hosts of the debate.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate, but the former vice president has a potentially larger headache – a lack of campaign cash.

As Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.

BIDEN'S THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING HAUL A WARNING SIGN

According to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.

Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, pressed on the report, told reporters in the spin room after the debate in suburban Columbus, Ohio that “it’s more important how you spend the money than how you raise it.""

And she emphasized that “we have resources that we need to continue to run our race. We’ve always said we think this race is going to be a dogfight, that it’s going to go long. We’re building an operation that is going to be sustained.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

On Wednesday, Biden said he was confident he had the fundraising to make it to the general election.

“Our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online. And we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready,” he told reporters at a campaign event in Ohio.

And taking aim at Warren – who transferred more than $10 million from her 2018 Senate re-election campaign to her White House bid – Biden noted he “did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from, into a race.”

It was just two weeks ago that Biden was left in the dust by Warren, Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg when it came to their third-quarter fundraising hauls. And unlike Warren and Sanders – who’ve brought in most of their money from small-dollar grassroots donations -- much of Biden’s money comes from top-dollar fundraising events with big-bucks donors.

A Democratic consultant who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely called the $15.2 million Biden raised in the third quarter “a devastating number.”

Taking an indirect shot at Biden, Warren campaign chief strategist Joe Rospars highlighted the new data released Tuesday.

“The FEC report data are pretty stark. There’s nowhere to hide from the reality of the dollars and the calendar in front of us,” Rospars tweeted on Wednesday. “Is a campaign’s fundraising growing? Is its spending able to grow going into the early contests, as it must? For Warren, the answers are yes and yes.”

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.

Ceraso, who worked on Sanders’ 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or “his cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.”

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised left him, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

Republicans spotlighted Biden’s campaign cash on hand figures as a warning sign for a candidate who has already relinquished his status as the unrivaled front-runner in the polls.

“Biden’s money problems are now a crisis for the campaign and if he doesn’t turn it around soon, he’ll end up on the sidelines sooner than anyone anticipated,” emphasized Joe Gierut, press secretary for the pro-Republican America Rising PAC.

Fundraising is far from definitive, but like polling, it’s an important barometer of a candidate’s momentum and his or her campaign’s strength. Among the things funds can be used for are building staff and grassroots outreach efforts in the crucial early voting states and running TV, radio, and digital ads.

Biden ‘eclipsed’ on 2020 debate stage

The spotlight on the former vice president’s campaign cash numbers came as the spotlight at the debate shifted from him to Warren, who has soared in recent months and is now tied in most national and early voting state polling with Biden for the top spot in the nomination race.

Biden was front-and-center as the debate kicked off, focusing on the Ukrainian controversy and the impeachment inquiry.

But when the conversation turned to the battle over ""Medicare-for-all,"" the former vice president was mostly absent from the discussion as the spotlight shifted to Warren.

The populist senator, who has produced one progressive policy proposal after another, grabbed the most speaking time in the debate, roughly six more minutes than Biden, who was second.

“He faded at times,” noted Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of the Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor. ""He popped his head up occasionally.

“He did allow himself to get eclipsed by some others, like Buttigieg and (Sen. Amy) Klobuchar and some of the others,” added Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign who later steered communications for the Democratic National Committee. “He’s got to step up. He cannot miss opportunities and I think he missed a few.”

GOP strategist and presidential campaign veteran Colin Reed called Biden “nearly invisible” at the debate and said it’s “a sign of how far this campaign has fallen that no one bothers to go after him.”

But Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a top Biden friend and 2020 surrogate, told reporters in the spin room on Tuesday night that being out of the spotlight benefitted Biden.

“Unlike previous debates where the vast majority of the attention was focused on testing or challenging Vice President Biden, tonight was a night when Sen. Warren’s plans on a wide range of issues – from the wealth tax to 'Medicare-for-all' – came under repeated questioning,” Coons highlighted.

Biden echoed that sentiment on Wednesday, saying ""it's kind of about time other people get questioned.""

And he pushed back on the labeling of Warren as a co-front-runner, saying “I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner.”

On Tuesday, PJ Media commemorated the ""one-year anniversary"" of Warren's publicized DNA results, which had been aimed at silencing critics who claimed the 2020 frontrunner falsely declared herself Native American in order to advance her career. According to the analysis, Warren may be anywhere between 1/64 and 1/1024 Native American.

As part of the reveal, Warren made tweets, had an entire ""Fact Squad"" page on her campaign website and posted a video documenting the entire process of her ancestry discovery. However, PJ Media also flagged that all web posts about the DNA results from Warren and her campaign were subsequently scrubbed from the Internet, including Twitter, YouYube and the Warren campaign site.

The Wayback Machine, an Internet archiving service, showed that links to her tweet, the ""Fact Squad"" page on her heritage and the YouTube video were no longer active.

She appeared to be referring to Warren's comments during a previous debate in which she accused the moderators of parroting Republican talking points by raising concerns about ""Medicare-for-all.""

Warren, D-Mass., has repeatedly refused to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class. During Tuesday's debate, she maintained that she would lower costs for everyone except the wealthy and large corporations. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has similarly pledged to lower costs but disclosed that his plan would entail raising taxes.

PETE BUTTIGIEG RELEASES AD CRITICAL OF SANDERS' AND WARREN'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' HEALTH PLANS

Both Warren and Sanders have been at the forefront of pushing ""Medicare-for-all,"" a controversial and sweeping proposal that would effectively limit private health insurance. But Klobuchar suggested that Warren's plan was a ""pipe dream"" without naming specifics like tax increases.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg specifically called out Warren over this issue, arguing that she was taking away Americans' choice with her plan. Both he and Klobuchar instead pushed a public option.

Warren responded by arguing that Buttigieg's plan -- ""Medicare for all who want it"" -- would actually limit coverage to people who could afford it. She also shared several stories from the campaign trail of voters who went bankrupt because of medical costs.

In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ""co-front-runner.""

“I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,” Biden said. “You guys keep talking about that.”

JOE BIDEN'S POTENTIALLY TROUBLING CAMPAIGN CASH REPORT

Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that “Warren has done very well. She’s moved.”

The former vice president was the unrivaled leader of the pack in the 2020 nomination race even before he declared his candidacy in late April. But Warren, gaining stature in a field that once had some two dozen presidential hopefuls, has surged; in many of the most recent national, early-primary-state and caucus-state surveys, she’s virtually tied Biden for the top spot.

Warren’s new status was clearly on display at Tuesday night’s fourth-round nomination debate, when she came under attack from many of her rivals on the stage. Biden, who was the recipient of most of the incoming fire during the first three rounds of debates, was at times absent from the action.

RIVALS TAKE ON WARREN OVER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL, MORE, AT DEBATE

Still, Biden downplayed suggestions that he’s been eclipsed by Warren, saying on the day after the debate that “it's kind of about time other people get questioned.”

But Warren's chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, pointing to the attention Warren received at the debate and to new fundraising reports that potentially hint at some trouble for Biden – tweeted on Wednesday that “it’s rare that we get as much real information in one day to clarify the state of the Democratic primary as we did yesterday.”

Near the top of Tuesday’s debate, two primary rivals -- South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- forcefully took aim at Warren for not directly answering if she’d raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for her push to implement a government-run “Medicare-for-all” health care system.

On that score, Biden had this to say on Wednesday: “It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board. And you know, credibility matters. It matters.”

""She’s going to have to tell the truth, or a question will be raised about whether she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people,” Biden said. “I don’t want to pick on Elizabeth Warren, but this is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.”

Biden, who opposes the Medicare-for-all plan long championed by more progressive rivals like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont instead supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act with a public option.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

“The last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing (President) Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy,""Biden said. “There’s nothing easy about it. If you’re going to do it, tell us how you’re going to do it. It’s called truth in speaking.”

Warren’s campaign told Fox News that the senator is “reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie [Sanders] campaign along with other revenue options.”

Warren further emphasized at the debate that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Beyond health care, Biden criticized Warren for saying during the debate that “I think that we [the United States] ought to get out of the Middle East.”

Warren – who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee – appeared to suggest an end to the decades-old U.S. military presence in the volatile Mideast. Her comments came during a discussion of President Trump’s heavily criticized move to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria.

While Warren has long called for reducing America’s military presence overseas, her campaign said after the debate that the candidate was talking only about combat troops.

“Senator Warren was referencing combat troops, not those stationed in the Middle East in non-combat roles. She believes we need to end the endless wars. That means working to responsibly remove U.S. troops from combat in the Middle East, and using diplomacy to work with allies and partners to end conflicts and suffering in the region,” the campaign said in a statement.

Biden, on Wednesday, said he “frankly was surprised” by Warren’s comments.

The former vice president – who repeatedly touts his foreign policy chops – added that “I had never heard any say, with any serious background on foreign policy, that we pull all troops out of the Middle East. … I’m not sure exactly what she meant by it.”

“If she meant pulling our fleet out of the eastern Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf, I think it would be an absolute disaster for American security and American foreign policy.”

Biden repeated his criticism – without naming Warren – later Wednesday when he delivered a foreign policy address in Iowa.

Elizabeth Warren, during an interview after the CNN presidential debate Tuesday night, recalled a man with multiple sclerosis speaking at one of her town halls about his fight for health care -- but video from the event showed she apparently got her facts wrong.

CNN commentator Van Jones pressed Warren on her stance of Medicare-for-all, specifically whether she ""cares"" about people's freedom to opt out of a government-run health care plan.

“What I care about is that they don’t get pushed out,"" Warren responded.

The Massachusetts senator then recalled a town hall attendee she engaged with on the campaign trail.

“I had a young man stand up at a town hall and explain that he had been diagnosed with MS, and his insurance company refused to pay for one of his treatments,” Warren continued. “He had started down the treatment line, and his explanation of it was, there he was, he had insurance, he fights with his insurance company, 'no no no no no,' until he finally ends up in the public system.”

“But understand this, he described it as I have now a lesion in my brain that is an inch long that I will carry for all my life... An insurance company, a man who was fully insured, said ‘You know, we’re just not going to pay for this.'”

ELIZABETH WARREN APPARENTLY SCRUBS DNA-TEST ROLLOUT FROM CAMPAIGN SITE, TWITTER

As Mediaite pointed out, she made multiple errors.

The exchange Warren had with the town hall attendee took place last month in New Hampshire, where a man named Dylan said he was diagnosed with MS and described his situation.

However, as Mediaite's Tommy Christopher explained, Dylan ""was not covered by insurance, which was why his treatment lapsed, and he didn’t end up 'in the public system,' he was denied Medicare because the government deemed him insufficiently disabled.""

Here is what Dylan told Warren:

""I am someone who really relies on my health insurance a lot more than most people, I live with an invisible illness, multiple sclerosis, and I’ve been denied disability basically because, in their words, they don’t think I’m disabled enough.""

""And because of this I basically have to constantly fight to keep my health insurance, and over the summer I was kicked off, not my mistake, but I had to pay for it, and in about 3 months of me trying to get my insurance back, I was delayed from my disease modified therapy, which now resulted in a new centimeter-size lesion that’s going to follow me for life because someone tried to save a few dollars.""

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night’s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run Medicare-for-all plan.

After being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate at Otterbein University whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health care proposal, the progressive senator from Massachusetts didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Moments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who’s soared in polling in recent months and is now considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden.

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued that “your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Buttigieg then touted his plan for “Medicare-for-all-who-want it,” which, unlike the Medicare-for-all proposal championed by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would not eliminate private insurance.

Warren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: “Let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,' understand what that means: It’s 'Medicare for all who can afford it.' And that’s the problem we’ve got. Medicare-for-all is the gold standard.”

But Mayor Pete counterpunched: “I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years.”

DEMOCRATS UNITE IN IMPEACHING TRUMP AT TOP OF TUESDAY'S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON

Sanders, who authored the Medicare-for-all bill in the Senate, chimed in, noting that “as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I say, let’s be clear, under the Medicare-for-all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone.""



But then he said “it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up” before adding that “for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.”

Asked again by the moderators if she would acknowledge what Sanders had just said, that middle-class taxes would rise, Warren answered, “What I have committed to is that costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren.

The Minnesota Democrat said that “at least Bernie’s being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

Suggesting that Warren would never be able to pass her Medicare-for-all plan through Congress, Klobuchar said ""the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.""

Biden also chimed in, jabbing at Warren without naming her, accusing her of not being straightforward.

""On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them,"" Biden noted. ""The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.""

And he charged that under the Sanders and Warren plan, ""if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work."""

Warren's comments came during CNN's LGBTQ forum last week when she was asked what she would say to someone who supports marriage between ""one man and one woman.""

“Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that,"" Warren replied. Then she added, “And I’m going to say, then just marry one woman — I’m cool with that. Assuming you can find one.""

The exchange went viral on social media and earned Warren high praise from the left.

Marcus praised Warren's delivery as charismatic but said the senator took a risk by being morally presumptuous and assuming the high ground with millions of key voters.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR ELIZABETH WARREN'S PROMISE

Marcus viewed the moment as ""a mistake that evoked missteps of Democratic campaigns past — a dismissiveness that Warren and her fellow candidates would do well to avoid.""

""This is bad politics, which may be the strongest immediate argument for shifting course, yet it is something worse than that,"" Marcus wrote. ""It reflects an attitude of intolerance and disrespect toward people of faith. Those who reasonably expect tolerance and respect should think about — well, they should think about the importance of practicing what they preach.""

Marcus cited the religious right's resistance to gay marriage and said dissenters deserve to be treated with a modicum of respect and tolerance instead of being talked down to.

""Major religions, including the Catholic Church, continue to teach that homosexual conduct is immoral and to oppose same-sex marriage. That is their right,"" she wrote. ""As that enterprise proceeds, it is important that it be conducted with the respect that Warren failed to display.""

Marcus also noted how Warren's comments could hurt her with African American voters who tend to be socially conservative and unsupportive of gay marriage.

""Most immediately, this dismissive attitude is politically dangerous,"" the op-ed reads. ""In the short term, Warren’s seeming intolerance toward those whose faith rejects same-sex marriage could hurt her with African American voters. In the general election, her comments carried unsettling echoes of Democratic missteps past.""

""It’s also just bad behavior,"" Marcus added. ""Disagree, vehemently; don’t disrespect. Tell the imaginary questioner — and the millions of Americans who share his conviction — that you believe his view is misguided, intolerant, insulting. Explain why.

""The seeds of socialism have already been planted and, if we don’t rip [them] out at the roots, we and future generations are gonna wake up to a living nightmare."" — Tomi Lahren, Fox Nation host

""Bernie Sanders dispelled the notion that he and Elizabeth Warren are basically the same person -- even seemingly taking a bit of offense to being compared to Warren,"" Lahren said on Fox Nation's ""Final Thoughts.""

""Not because she lied about being a Native American, not because she may have lied about being fired for being pregnant, but because she is a capitalist,"" she continued.

TOMI LAHREN ISN'T SHOCKED BY 'SQUAD'S ENDORSEMENT

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ""will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

Instead, Sanders is trying to run on a ""Democratic"" brand of socialism, which Lahren called ""a lie and an oxymoron.""

""You can’t have freedom -- economic or otherwise -- under socialism. He and others simply slap that 'democratic' before 'socialism' to make their warped desires of government-controlled everything seem more palatable,"" Lahren said. ""Sad thing is, it’s working -- especially on young Americans.""

SANDERS PROMISES NEW JOBS FOR 'TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' DURING DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

A Gallup poll this year found 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, compared to a 1942 Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing.

""This just goes to show how dangerously close we are to becoming a socialist nation,"" said Lahren, commenting on the poll. ""The seeds of socialism have already been planted and, if we don’t rip those suckers out at the roots, we and future generations are gonna wake up to a living nightmare,"" she warned.

Lahren blamed the ""shocking and downright frightening"" shift on a misrepresentation of socialism and warned of potential ramifications.

""What is happening here?"" she asked. ""Well, leaders like Bernie... Warren, and others are not being honest about what socialism actually entails. They characterize it as a method of rooting out corruption, sticking it to the 'man,' and fighting for the little guy when, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.""

""Socialism breeds corruption,"" she continued. ""There is no bigger 'man' than the 'Almighty Government' and the little guy is the one who is absolutely crushed by socialism.""

Doubling down in her criticism of the Vermont senator and his socialist policies, Lahren warned ""young people of the country"" not to fall for ""free things that will cost them their freedom.""

BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS’ PLAN: ECONOMISTS

""I know free things might sound great to you now,"" she said, ""but here’s the cold, hard truth -- those free things come at a cost of your freedom. Don’t like being told what to do? Wait till you live under socialism. It won’t be pretty. You can be free or you can be dependent on the government -- but you can't be both. Choose wisely,"" she said.

""This next election and, even more importantly, the one after that, will determine the future of this nation,"" Lahren concluded. ""Don’t take it lightly.""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the big winner Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also delivered strong performances.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and the other eight candidates on stage came out the losers in the three-hour Democratic presidential primary debate.

BIGGEST WINNER: Elizabeth Warren

Warren’s strong performance will likely solidify her frontrunner status ahead of Biden and Sanders. She emerged the clear winner of the night by showing she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

Even during the heated exchanges over health care and a wealth tax, Warren was able to turn attacks leveled against her around, and still deliver the best answers of the evening.

Warren questioned why the other candidates “think it is more important to protect billionaires than to invest in Americans” when responding to an attack on her plan for a wealth tax.

And importantly, Warren remained the focal point of the debate, speaking for the most amount of time of all of the candidates.

The senator from Massachusetts now has unmatched fundraising and polling momentum, along with a series of strong debate performances. This, coupled with the fact that Biden and Sanders have been weakened in dissimilar but debilitating ways recently, almost guarantees that Warren will take over as the front-runner.

SURPRISE WINNER: Bernie Sanders

Sanders has faced a precipitous decline in the most recent polls given the significant questions about his health and stamina following his recent heart attack.

However, Sanders delivered a strong, forceful performance in the debate, succeeding in showing voters that he has not lost a step, making him the second-place finisher of the night.

But it is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

It is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

SURPRISE WINNER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg has been called the breakout star of the Democratic field – though he has recently struggled to distinguish himself. He had several strong moments in the Tuesday night debate. He was able to make a compelling case as a young, center-left candidate from a swing state with a military background.

Buttigieg was particularly strong during a tense exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over President Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, delivering a response that elicited cheers from the audience.

“Respectfully congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” the mayor said. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it's a consequence of a withdrawal and betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

Ultimately, Buttigieg’s performance will likely result in a post-debate polling bump with moderate voters, especially given Biden’s relatively weak debate performance.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Joe Biden

All eyes, particularly those of Democratic leaders, strategists, and donors were on Biden, who needed deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump.

However, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

With each passing day, Biden seems to move further from securing the Democratic presidential nomination, and his unimpressive performance Tuesday night will likely result in a post-debate polling decline.

LOSER: Amy Klobuchar

Additionally, although Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had a number of well-executed lines taking aim at Warren, many felt similar to the inconsequential attacks leveled against Warren by former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland during the first debate. Thus, Klobuchar’s performance is unlikely to result in the post-debate polling spike her campaign needed.

LOSER: Kamala Harris

Sen. Kamala Harris of California similarly fell short, as she failed to distinguish herself in any meaningful way at a time when her campaign desperately needs a boost. Given that recent polls have her hoovering at around 5 percent, she will likely not be able to regain the momentum she had just over two months ago.

LOSERS: Gabbard, Castro, Steyer, Booker, O’Rourke and Yang

The remaining candidates – all barely registering in polls – were the biggest losers of the night. Rep. Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas and entrepreneur Andrew Yang failed to have the breakout moment they all desperately needed to show voters they could defeat Trump in November 2020.

Bernie Sanders for president.

Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed.

In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event.

""Bernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography,"" Omar was quoted as saying in a statement posted on Twitter by the Sanders campaign — and that Omar retweeted on her own Twitter page.

""I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020,"" Omar added.

The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who, like Sanders, has been representing the party’s progressive wing.

Word of the endorsements also followed Tuesday night’s Democratic debate in Ohio, where Warren was under attack from multiple candidates after rising in the polls in recent weeks.

Winning the OK of the “Squad” members was also viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens — Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70 years old.

There was no indication that the fourth member of the Squad, Rep. Ayannna Pressley, D-Mass., was ready to make an endorsement — either of Sanders or any other candidate.

""Honestly, if Hillary Clinton were to make her grand reentrance, now would be about the time she should do it. Because the fact is, a lot of people are dissatisfied with [Joe] Biden. A lot of people are dissatisfied with [Elizabeth] Warren and Hillary is an enormous name.""

Shapiro predicted that if Clinton got into the race she would easily clinch the nomination, but said she is unlikely to do so, paving the way for a Trump victory next November.

Given Joe Biden’s refusal to do any interviews since impeachment cast a spotlight on his family’s conduct, it was striking that he handed the ball to his son before the one forum where he couldn’t duck questions: the CNN/New York Times marathon.

And 17 minutes into the Ohio debate, when Anderson Cooper asked Biden the question, he retreated to “my son’s statement speaks for itself”—precisely the point of orchestrating the ABC interview.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

Cooper asked a key question: If Hunter Biden now says he won’t do any foreign work if his dad becomes president, why was it okay when Joe was vice president?

Biden ignored that, saying “my son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong,” then pivoted to denouncing Rudy Giuliani, President Trump and his “thugs” as liars. He would not acknowledge the lousy optics that even Hunter conceded.

The striking aftermath: None of the other Democrats on the stage said a negative word about Biden or his son’s lucrative deal in Ukraine. They deemed it off limits. Cory Booker defended Biden, saying no one should be “attacking a statesman.”

But Cooper also softened the question by saying “the president has made false accusations against your son” and “there is no evidence of wrongdoing by you and your son.” Why not let Biden make that case? Why appear to take sides? And is there absolutely no wrongdoing by Hunter, who was unqualified for the Ukrainian gas gig, as opposed to no evidence of criminal wrongdoing?

The only real action was on health care, though it wasn’t as exciting as the Washington Nationals scoring seven first-inning runs on their way to the World Series. In fact, that part of the debate seemed more like an old replay.

Once again, a journalist—in this case Marc Lacey of the Times—asked Elizabeth Warren if the middle class would pay more under the Medicare for All measure she is pushing.

Once again, Warren rolled out her standard response: The rich and big corporations will pay more, the middle class will pay less.

Lacey followed up—will you raise middle-class taxes?—and once again, the Massachusetts senator sidestepped: “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.” Notice she said costs, not taxes. (Bernie Sanders, who wrote the damn bill, admits middle-class taxes will rise.)

Pete Buttigieg was more blunt, saying Warren had failed to answer a yes or no question. She dodged it again.

Amy Klobuchar, showing unusual aggressiveness, said Warren would kick 150 million Americans off their private insurance. I don’t know why the debate questioners don’t focus on this rather crucial point.

Biden said what he said in the last debate, that Medicare for All would cost $30 trillion over a decade and taxes would go up, but his rejoinder had less force.

After that, the debate settled into something of a wonkfest. What about auto jobs? Should there be a wealth tax? Can gun buybacks work? CNN’s practice of usually letting each of the 12 candidates answer the same question added to the drone factor.

Something else was at work. It’s now clear that the race has settled into a contest between Biden and Warren, with Sanders (looking vigorous despite his heart attack) continuing to slip. Everyone else has been mired in single digits for many months. So there’s far less media excitement if Kamala Harris has a strong moment or Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke get into a spat on gun control. Impeachment dominated the pregame programming, with the debate a secondary story.

The moderators, who included Erin Burnett, were fine, but could have done far more to sharpen the contrasts between the contenders.

On Trump’s pullout from northern Syria, Biden was strikingly emotional, saying of the Kurds: “They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful, what this man has done!” Warren accused Trump of giving ISIS a new lease on life. Buttigieg called it a “betrayal.” The only dissenter was Tulsi Gabbard, who wants to end the ""endless war"" and accused CNN and the Times of smearing her.

But such brief fireworks were the exception, and that was the weakness of the debate. Far too much time was spent on the candidates denouncing Trump in unison, sometimes just changing the adjectives. That undoubtedly made Democratic viewers feel good, but did little to distinguish among the contenders.

That pattern began at the outset, when Cooper asked about impeachment. While he tried mixing up the questions—why not let the voters evict Trump instead, is impeachment a distraction?—every Democrat on the stage competed to castigate the president in stronger terms (Bernie won with “most corrupt in history""). Biden and Warren talked about the Mueller report, making clear that they were primed for impeachment before the Ukraine mess surfaced.

The only real change from the last three debates was that Biden briefly had to defend his son’s buckraking in Ukraine. Impeachment has frozen the race, and that’s bad news for anyone not named Joe or Elizabeth."

Elizabeth Warren to attacks on the specific questions asked by moderators.

The Hill media reporter Joe Concha told Fox News that CNN’s debate enhanced its already not-so-respectable reputation.

TULSI GABBARD SLAMS CNN, NEW YORK TIMES DURING DEBATE FOR 'DESPICABLE' 'SMEARS' OVER SYRIA, RUSSIA

“The network is under heavy criticism from the left and right today, and rightly so,” Concha said. “Its pursuit of sizzle over steak and focus on social issues over truly substantiate matters – economy, jobs, opioid crisis, border crisis, all-things China – has damaged the network's credibility even further.”

CNN partnered up with The New York Times for the event, which was moderated by CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and Gray Lady editor Marc Lacey. While viewers complained about several issues with the moderators, a question Cooper asked about Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush’s friendship was perhaps the most lampooned.

“Three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration,” Julian Castro tweeted. “Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border. But you know, Ellen.”

CNN FACES MORE ACCUSATIONS OF POLITICAL BIAS AHEAD OF DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Sen. Kamala Harris also took to Twitter to criticize the moderators, noting there weren’t questions about climate change, LGBTQ rights or immigration.

“These issues are too important to ignore,” Harris wrote.

While Castro and Harris used social media, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hi., slammed CNN and The Times directly from the debate stage over what she described as ""smears"" against her on foreign policy.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall said the major flaw was that moderators allowed Sen. Elizabeth Warren to dominate the proceedings.

“The time imbalance was so obvious and quite unfair to Gabbard, Castro and the others. That Warren is now or at the top of recent polls is no excuse for allowing such an imbalance,” McCall told Fox News. “A candidate forum is supposed to give all candidates a fair opportunity to engage the dialogue and that absolutely did not happen. The debate moderators apparently don't own stopwatches.”

McCall said the imbalance “lends credence to the critics who say these forums are all about promoting some candidates over others” and Warren was clearly the favorite.

CNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'

“The moderators were also quite powerless at times when they tried to move on or determine who would speak next. Candidates tended to ignore the moderators’ directions and interrupt as they wanted,” McCall said, adding that talking over the moderators is nothing new.

“This is standard procedure now in these televised spectacles, but it remains a weakness in the format and relegates moderators to bystanders at times,” he said.

The debate came hours after a secretly recorded video appeared to show a CNN staffer saying the network likes Warren “a lot” and dislikes Gabbard. CNN’s own Twitter account even pointed out that Gabbard received less time than other candidates. According to CNN itself, Warren spoke for over 22 minutes, followed by Biden’s 16-plus minutes, while Gabbard only spoke for roughly eight minutes.

Following the debate, Gabbard’s sister criticized CNN via a tweet sent by the candidate’s verified account that accused the network of cutting off Gabbard to “protect Warren.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

“It was no surprise that CNN began with almost 20 minutes talking about impeachment and defending the Bidens seeing as how CNN's been obsessed with impeachment for at least three years now,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News.

“Between cutting off Tulsi Gabbard and asking far-left, leading questions on abortion, gun control, and the Supreme Court, CNN reminded America last night just how invested they are in defeating and removing the President from office,” Houck added.

Conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that the debate was harmful to candidates because liberal moderators were so easy on them.

“CNN is actually doing a disservice to the Democratic candidates and to Democratic voters by refusing to ask tough questions of the front runners,” Barron said. “Whoever the Democrats nominate will have to square off against President Trump on the debate stage and I promise you he won’t treat the nominee with kid gloves”

Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that CNN wouldn’t be a “neutral referee” because of its own bias and that was before the debate even started -- and the moderators didn’t do anything to change his mind.

DAN GAINOR: ELIZABETH WARREN DRAWS MOST ATTENTION FROM MEDIA AND CANDIDATES IN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

“CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject – one easy one for each candidate,” Gainor wrote following the debate.

CNN and The Times were also heavily criticized for overlooking China, which has been a focal point of the recent news cycle. China made headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States and the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA – but the moderators didn’t seem to care what 2020 candidates thought about the situation.

""There hasn’t been one question about China in this entire 3 hour debate. It is shameful,"" ""The View"" co-host Meghan McCain tweeted.

The ""foreign policy"" portion of the debate featured questions predominately about Trump's recent troop withdrawal from Syria as well as handling Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It's patently amazing that the network couldn't find the time over three hours to ask one question about arguably a Top-3 topic going into the 2020 election, China, but did ask as its final question of the night about the friendship between Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush,” Concha said.

Plenty of others took to Twitter to chime in on the debate, too:

One day after reports emerged that the group of far-left House Democrats planned to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential race, it seemed only one of them – Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – was officially aboard the Bernie Bus:

As for the others:

-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had made no official endorsement but was still rumored to be attending a Sanders rally scheduled for this weekend in Queens, N.Y. – one of two New York city boroughs that include a portion of Ocasio-Cortez’s home district.

BIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

-- Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., clarified Wednesday that she had not yet endorsed a 2020 presidential candidate – even though CNN and Omar claimed Tlaib had backed Sanders.

-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., also hadn’t made an endorsement.

Pressley’s camp stressed that while the Squad members support one another in Congress, they don’t necessarily speak with one voice on all issues.

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service,” a Pressley spokesperson told Vox. “Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.”

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.” — Spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.

One factor possibly stalling a Pressley endorsement of Sanders: She hails from the same state as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, so she might not be as eager to oppose a presidential candidate from her home area – the way that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for example, backed former Vice President Joe Biden instead of her fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris.

According to Boston.com, Pressley’s ties to the Sanders campaign aren’t as strong as those of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, with Pressley having backed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. In addition, Pressley has worked with Warren on legislation in Congress and also has close relationships with Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who have been seeking her endorsement, the report said.

Tlaib, meanwhile, hasn’t ruled out a Sanders endorsement down the road, telling the Detroit Free Press she will host the U.S. senator from Vermont in her district later this month – just as she recently did recently with Warren. (Warren posted video from that visit online Wednesday -- and Tlaib retweeted it.)

""I am looking forward to bringing Senator Sanders to Michigan on Oct. 27 for a tour of our district that will highlight economic justice issues and corporate tax giveaways, and (include) a roundtable with housing justice advocates,” Tlaib said. “I need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen. Sanders about these critically important issues.”

But regardless of what Tlaib and Pressley ultimately decide to do, the Sanders endorsement by Omar – and rumored endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez – were blows to the Warren campaign, coming on the same night that the senator fended off fierce attacks from fellow Democrats at the party’s presidential debate in Ohio.

As Boston.com noted, Warren has courted Ocasio-Cortez, having lunch with her in March, writing a blurb for Ocasio-Cortez’s entry in Time magazine’s “Time 100” listing, and filming a video with Ocasio-Cortez in which the pair reviewed the final episode of “Game of Thrones.”"

Challenging night for Warren: Dems attack her on debate stage, then ‘Squad’ backs Sanders

Tuesday was arguably a bad night for rising Democratic presidential co-frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate and then reports surfaced that members of “The Squad” were set to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president. Several of the candidates during the debate in Westerville, Ohio, criticized Warren for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class. Click here for more on this story.

But perhaps the most disheartening news for Warren came after the debate. Reports said that at least three members of the “Squad” of far-left freshman members of Congress will endorse Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart attack. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., issued a statement confirming her endorsement, and CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Squad member Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., will endorse a candidate soon.

Biden insists he and son Hunter did nothing wrong, focus should be on Trump corruption

During Tuesday’s debate Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing. Biden had been at the top of the crowded field for months but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

CNN anchor Anderson Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. Ultimately, the elder Biden insisted neither he nor Hunter did anything wrong and that the focus should be on President Trump. ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on,"" he said. Click here for more on this story.

Other highlights in the debate: All of the 12 Democrats onstage backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

Sanders stood by his claim that he would provide jobs for every single American -- ""tens of millions of Americans"" - purportedly ending unemployment in the United States. Biden, Warren, and Sanders -- who is recovering from a heart attack two weeks ago -- all faced pointed questions about their age, and health and how those factors could affect their electability and potential presidency.

The simmering bad blood between rivals South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas appeared to boil over as they continued to jab at each other. At one point, Buttigieg, who has said that O’Rourke’s gun buyback proposal could hurt Democrats appeal with moderate voters, firmly told O'Rourke: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage.”

CNN and The New York Times were widely criticized for not asking any of the 12 Democratic candidates about China during Tuesday night's presidential debate. China has made making major headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States as well as the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA after the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey made a tweet in support of the Hong Kong protesters.

Doug Schoen: The fourth Democratic debate's big winner, biggest loser and two surprise showings

According to Doug Schoen, a Fox News contributor and veteran Democratic pollster and consultant, Elizabeth Warren was still the big winner in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. In his analysis for Fox News Digital, Schoen said Warren showed she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead -- and that only solidified her frontrunner status.

The biggest loser, according to Schoen, was Joe Biden, who needed to deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump. However, Schoen wrote, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Schoen said, were two surprise winners for delivering strong performances. Click here for more of Schoen's winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate.

""I don't find it shocking,"" said Lahren on the endorsement, ""and if Bernie Sanders really covets this endorsement, I think that tells you everything you need to know about Bernie Sanders,"" she said Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is set to appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally following the senator's recent heart procedure. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed.

SANDERS PROMISES NEW JOBS FOR 'TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' DURING DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Lahren said she wasn't shocked by the endorsement from the ""Squad"" for the openly socialist candidate, as many of the far-left congresswomen have previously expressed support for his policies.

""The fact that we're in a place in this country where we take any of them seriously, let alone elect them to office, is appalling,"" she said.

""The bigger problem here is that this is what's actually happening in an election for President of the United States."" — Tomi Lahren, Fox Nation host

""But at the end of the day, we know this isn't shocking or important, we knew they were going to endorse Bernie Sanders, they're all socialists, and the bigger problem here is that this is what's actually happening in an election for President of the United States,"" Lahren continued.

The endorsements came as a potential blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who, like Sanders, has been representing the party’s progressive wing.

Winning the OK of the “Squad” members was viewed as crucial in attracting young voters for the top three Democrats in the polls, all of whom are in their 70's — with Sanders at 78, former Vice President Joe Biden at 76 and Warren at 70 years old.

Reiterating her point, Lahren credited Sanders for ""calling himself a socialist,"" unlike Warren.

""The thing I'll give Bernie Sanders credit for is that he is one of the only ones...that actually calls himself a socialist...at least he's forthright about what he wants to do to this country,"" Lahren continued.

""The rest of them are just on some various degree of wanting socialism...at least he's forthright about it and that's the only credit I'll give to the members of the Squad as well is that they really want a structural transformation of this country that will be devastating and damaging — but at least they're honest with the American people about what they want for this country,"" Lahren said.

Later in the segment, Lahren highlighted her latest episode on Fox Nation's ""No Interruption,"" where she sat down with the real-life ""Wolf of Wall Street"" Jordan Belfort to hear his perspective on the 2020 candidates.

Belfort had strong words for Sanders and Warren, both of whom have called for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amok, it gets really ugly,"" said Belfort. ""What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… but the policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said in the latest Fox Nation episode.

PETE BUTTIGIEG RELEASES AD CRITICAL OF SANDERS' AND WARREN'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' HEALTH PLANS

Rising in polls and facing increased scrutiny, Sen. Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night’s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" plan.

Warren, D-Mass., has repeatedly refused to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class. During Tuesday's debate, she maintained that she would lower costs for everyone except the wealthy and large corporations. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has similarly pledged to lower costs but disclosed that his plan would entail raising taxes.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE’LL FINANCE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

After being asked by the moderators early in the fourth-round debate at Otterbein University whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health care proposal, the progressive senator from Massachusetts didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Host Sandra Smith said estimates place the 10-year cost of the ""Medicare-for-all"" plans at $32-34 trillion.

""Don't the candidates on that stage touting 'Medicare-for-all' have to explain how you pay for it?"" Smith asked.

“If you look back to the 2018 election, the American people spoke loud and clear that they wanted Democrats in power and that’s why we won back the House of Representatives and the number one issue was healthcare,” Hinojosa said.

That makes three members of the so-called “Squad” of far-left freshman members of Congress who are lining up behind Sanders for president.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim Thursday at presidential nomination rival Joe Biden, accusing the former vice president of using insurance industry “talking points” to criticize Sanders' plan to implement a government-run “Medicare-for-all” system.

“It is really sad that Joe Biden is using the talking points of the insurance industry to attack Medicare for All,” Sanders claimed in an email to supporters.

“Joe must know that we currently spend twice as much per capita on health care as the people of almost any other major country and that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” added the independent senator who’s making his second straight White House bid.

POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE

Biden has opposed the “Medicare-for-all” plan championed by Sanders and supported by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – a co-front-runner with Biden right now in the Democrats' primary race. The Senate bill – which Sanders authored – would eliminate private insurance. Biden, instead, has been pushing for a public option to strengthen and supplement the national health-care law better known as ObamaCare.

At Tuesday’s fourth-round presidential primary debate, Biden once again criticized “Medicare-for-all,” taking aim at its price tag.

“The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget,” he emphasized.

He also argued that the costs would be passed on to average Americans.

“If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000,” Biden noted. “That is more than they will possibly save on this health-care plan.”

BIDEN TAKES AIM AT SANDERS AND WARREN OVER 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

Responding, Sanders indirectly accused Biden of failing to stand up to the health-care industry.

“I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health-care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” he stressed.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR, SLAM WARREN OVER 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

“If we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves,” Sanders added.

Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Ohio, Biden returned fire, saying, “Bernie doesn’t pay for half his plan.”

And, taking aim at both Sanders and Warren – who unlike Sanders has refused to acknowledge that middle-class taxes would rise to pay for “Medicare-for-all” – Biden said, “look, the last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing (President) Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy. There’s nothing easy about it.”

The intra-party battle over implementing “Medicare-for-all” versus strengthening the nation’s health-care law – known as the Affordable Care Act – has been a leading and divisive issue in the race for the presidential nomination."

MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 'JUST NOT FOR ME'

The Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, released on Monday, indicated a three-way tie for the top spot in New Hampshire -- with Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 25 percent support, former Vice President Joe Biden at 24 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 22 percent.

But, if Obama hypothetically jumped into the race, the poll suggested she would grab 26 percent support of likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State, with Warren and Biden at 20 percent and Sanders at 15 percent.

Co-host Jesse Watters said the poll ""speaks to the weakness of Joe Biden.""

Fellow co-host Emily Compagno agreed in part, saying: ""it speaks to the weakness of Democrats in general.""

""Here's why, because it's the grass is greener on the other side. And we saw this in 2016 when they were pining after Joe Biden because they felt that he at that time better represented the Obama era,"" Compagno said. ""He wasn't getting beat up in the primary.""

""No matter what cycle it is there are always going to be pining for whoever is not there,"" Compagno added.

Perino weighed in again, saying that Biden will benefit from dealing with the Ukraine scandal involving his son Hunter in the primary if he can survive.

""Here's one thing I would say about Biden though, if he were to be able to get through this primary process and become the nominee it's much better to have had to deal with the Hunter situation in the primary than in the general election because then, by then it'll be baked into the cake,"" Perino said.

The tax credit would apply to companies in ""designated rural zones"" defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is capped at $250,000 a year. To be eligible, businesses must hire three or more new full-time workers, one of whom must live in the community.

When I am president, rural America will have a partner ready and willing to listen and work together on real solutions to the problems they face every day.”

Harris’ rural plan comes with a more than $100 billion price tag and will be paid for through a broad increase in corporate taxes.

In addition to the tax credit, her proposal says she will use executive action to eliminate “Trump’s tariffs,” expand rural health care and guarantee broadband access to all households by 2024.

Seven months later, it happened again.

President Trump on Tuesday issued his second veto against legislation seeking to end his national emergency at the southwestern border, rejecting bipartisan objections to his efforts to obtain funds for a border wall. His move, announced late Tuesday night, was expected and will return the resolution to Congress. It is unlikely to garner the two-thirds majority needed there to override the veto.

In case this isn’t obvious, it’s worth emphasizing that if Trump were politically confident about his position, and certain that the American mainstream was on his side about redirecting funds in defiance of Congress’ wishes, he wouldn’t have issued the veto late at night – during a Democratic presidential primary debate.

Nevertheless, this caught my eye for a couple of reasons. The first is that Trump may yet have to veto this same measure again. As regular readers may recall, under the National Emergencies Act, Congress can vote every six months on the president’s emergency declaration. Senate Democratic leaders have already forced the issue onto the floor twice – under these circumstances, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can’t block a vote – and they’ll likely do so again in the spring.

The second area of interest is the rarity of Trump’s use of his veto pen. For those keeping score, the list of measures vetoed by the Republican is quite short:

1. March 15, 2019: Trump vetoed a congressional effort to block his emergency declaration related to border barriers.

2. April 16, 2019: Trump vetoed a measure to end U.S. involvement in Yemen’s civil war.

3, 4, and 5. July 24, 2019: Trump vetoed three measures related to Saudi arms deals.

6. October 15, 2019: Trump vetoed another congressional effort to block his emergency declaration related to border barriers.

Or put another way, Trump has issued four vetoes intended to help Saudi Arabia, and two vetoes to redirect funds to the border in defiance of Congress’ wishes.

Nevertheless, Trump is on track to have the fewest vetoes of any American president since Warren Harding, whose presidency only lasted two years (1921 to 1923)."

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded to calls for social media companies to curtail President Trump's activities on platforms such as Twitter.

""My belief is that in a democracy, I don’t think that we want private companies censoring politicians in the news,"" Zuckerberg told Dana Perino in an exclusive interview airing Friday on ""The Daily Briefing.""

KAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT AMID WHISTLEBLOWER TWEETS

During the interview, Perino asked Zuckerberg about Sen. Kamala Harris' demand that Twitter shut down Trump's account, which the president uses regularly to share his views on a multitude of issues.

Zuckerberg said Silicon Valley shouldn't be taking such actions.

""I generally believe that as a principle, people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe, who they want to vote for,"" he said. ""And I don’t think that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of company doing.""

Earlier this month, Harris, D-Calif., claimed Trump was using Twitter to inappropriately criticize an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

""The President's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told CNN.

FACEBOOK CEO SAYS HE WON'T FURTHER ANTAGONIZE ELIZABETH WARREN AFTER THREATENING LAWSUIT

""Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting ... directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be -- his Twitter account should be suspended.”

In the interview with Perino, Zuckerberg also responded to another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's criticism of Facebook.

Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign account tweeted it had created a ""Facebook ad with false claims"" and submitted it to the social media site's platform, which approved it.

In that same series of tweets, Warren's team claimed Facebook had ""changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies — explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine.""

In a recent live-streamed company meeting, Zuckerberg said that he would ""try not to antagonize her [Warren] further.""

""Even when people disagree with what I think would be good to happen in the world, I still want to give them a voice — that's what we're here to do,"" Zuckerberg told his employees.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. for president, a move that will boost Bernie’s chances of winning the Democratic Party’s presidential primary race while simultaneously crushing his chances of beating Donald Trump in the 2020 general election.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have won immense praise from virtually every corner of the mainstream press and among the most extreme leftists in the Democratic Party. Both have been key players in promoting the “Green New Deal,” the most economically dangerous policy proposal offered in modern American history. (Sanders cosponsored Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal resolution in the Senate earlier in 2019.)

Among other things, Comrade Ocasio-Cortez’s GND would have the country abandon all fossil fuels over just a 10 year period, eliminate air travel, kill cows to halt climate change, provide “free” college, impose a single-payer health care system, and create a federal jobs guarantee.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Or, put more simply, the Green New Deal would transform America’s economy into a government-managed socialist nightmare. No wonder Ocasio-Cortez likes Bernie so much!

The timing for an endorsement couldn’t be better for Sanders, whose campaign took a big hit two weeks ago after the 78-year-old senator experienced a heart attack that forced him temporarily off the trail and gave a big boost to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Warren enjoys a strong lead over Sanders in most polls and is seen as the primary challenger to former Vice President Joe Biden, who remains the front-runner.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s endorsement of Sanders will likely help Bernie win greater support among young socialists and progressives in the primary race.

One of Sanders’ biggest campaign weaknesses has been that although he has all the necessary socialist credentials to win a primary race in the modern Democratic Party, he remains an old, wealthy, white guy trying to win a nomination in a party currently obsessed with identity politics.

Ocasio-Cortez, a charismatic 30-year-old Latina, and Omar, 38, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, will help to improve his image among those who seem to believe age and race are among the most important qualifications for the nation’s highest office.

But whatever help Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s support will offer Sanders in the upcoming primaries, it will most assuredly be heavily outweighed by the significant political damage these endorsements will have during the general election. Among many American voters, including middle-of-the-road Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are about as politically toxic as it gets. In fact, “toxic” is probably a big understatement; they’re the Chernobyl of modern American politics.

A poll conducted by Axios of white, likely 2020 general election voters, with less than two years of college education—a demographic Democrats need to do better with in 2020 than they did in 2016 to have any chance of defeating Trump, found that although recognition of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar was high, support for both young socialists was extremely low. Only 22 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable view of AOC, and only 9 percent said they had a positive view of Omar. Yes, you read that correctly—just 9 percent.

Further only 18 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable view of socialism, while nearly seven in ten said they disapprove of socialism.

In July, Axios reported a “top Democrat … invoiced in 2020 congressional races” indicated that the internal polling data conducted of AOC was so bad that it “could put the [House] majority at risk.”

Other polling data show Ocasio-Cortez’s popularity in the toilet with other demographics as well. A March Quinnipiac survey revealed only 23 percent of Americans had a positive view of Ocasio-Cortez. Even in her home state of New York, AOC’s support is lackluster. A survey released in August found only 41 percent of New Yorkers like Ocasio-Cortez, roughly the same percentage of Americans across the country who said they have a favorable view of the freshman congresswoman.

The data couldn’t be clearer: Americans don’t support Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s radical vision for America, so why would Bernie want to tie this gigantic anchor around his neck? Answer: He’s getting increasingly more desperate now that Warren’s campaign has started to surge.

Right from the start, it was apparent that for either Warren or Sanders to beat Biden, it would likely be necessary that one of the two would need to drop out of the race sooner rather than later.

Both Sanders and Warren come from the same region of the country and enjoy significant support within the most radical, socialist wings of the Democratic Party. Although the far left has unquestionably hijacked the DNC, it’s possible there still aren’t enough socialists in the party to push either Sanders or Warren in front of Biden while the vote is divided. From now until the primaries, the goal for Sanders and Warren will continue to be to try to build enough support to convince the other to drop out.

But all this political maneuvering will come at great cost. In order for Democrats to beat President Trump, they’ll need to do what Hillary Clinton couldn’t: win in much of the Midwest, in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Endorsements from AOC and Omar might make that incredibly difficult task even more insurmountable for Sanders, who already faced an uphill battle with voters because of the unpopularity of socialism in America’s Heartland.

With each passing day, it’s becoming more apparent that the leading Democratic Party candidates are digging the 2020 hole deeper and deeper, a clear sign that they are totally out of touch with the views of most American communities. How many times will they have to lose elections before they realize that people in the Heartland don’t share the same vision for the future as people like AOC and Ilhan Omar?

Based on the current campaign cycle, it appears the answer is at least one more presidential election.

The network landed an average of 8.3 million views during the three-hour telecast. That marked quite a dip from its previous two-part debates in July, where viewership peaked at 10.7 million. CNN's debate also saw an almost 50-percent drop from the first debate hosted by NBC News back in June, which received 15.3 million viewers.

In addition, 449,000 viewers watched live streams on various platforms from CNN and The New York Times, who co-hosted the debate.

The fourth debate featured 12 candidates on one stage. They were: former Vice President Joe Biden,; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

CNN DEBATE SLAMMED BY CRITICS, CANDIDATES: 'DAMAGED THE NETWORK'S CREDIBILITY EVEN FURTHER'

CNN and The Times faced an avalanche of criticism during and after the debate. The hosting news outlets received backlash for not asking the 12 candidates about topics including China, which has made big headlines in recent weeks amid the ongoing trade war with the U.S.; the mounting tensions in Hong Kong; and the growing controversy with the NBA.

Even the candidates slammed the debate hosts. Castro blasted the debate for not asking any questions about climate change but making time for a question about Ellen DeGeneres' friendship with former President George W. Bush. Harris similarly called out the news organizations for overlooking climate change, immigration and LGBT issues.

Gabbard, however, may have had the fiercest attack, which she made on the debate stage.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" she said, apparently gesturing toward the moderators. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears.

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends"" with hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade, Carter said Biden failed to properly address the charges against his son at a moment when he needed to reassure voters.

""Biden really needed to address this last night. He needed to hit this out of the park, and he did not,"" said Carter, the president of Maslansky & Partners.

Carter broadcast her ""voter dials,"" which assess the real-time reactions to the debate from voters across the political spectrum, rating statements from A to F.

WATCH: JOE BIDEN STUMBLES OVER WORDS DURING DEBATE

""Democrats just gave this a C -- not very good for them -- Independents a D, Republicans a D as well...Just not a lot of movement,"" she explained.

On Tuesday, Hunter Biden broke his silence in his first televised interview since his overseas business dealings came under scrutiny, maintaining he did nothing improper while he served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

The younger Biden said he did not discuss the Burisma Holdings board seat with his father, except for one ""brief exchange"" that was previously reported.

A photo obtained by Fox News last month showed Joe Biden and Hunter golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board with Hunter. Joe Biden had told Fox News that he never discussed his son’s foreign business dealings with him.

""Biden had to stand apart last night. He really had to make a difference. He had to address this allegation,"" Carter told the ""Friends"" hosts.

""What we heard from voters last night is, 'This seems inconsistent with what his son himself said.' And, I'm not so sure that he made any kind of an impact, and I think we're going to see him continue to peter in the polls,"" she said.

Carter predicted that current frontrunner Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will continue to soar in the polls and others will plateau.

It is being replaced by a new Democratic-Socialist Party.

If you think I exaggerate, consider these examples.

Imagine what would have happened if any candidate in the debate had the courage (or lack of sense) to actively defend President Bill Clinton’s policies on welfare reform, capital gains tax cuts and balanced federal budgets, or his 1996 State of the Union assertion that “the era of Big Government is over.”

RONNA MCDANIEL: FOURTH DEMOCRATIC DEBATE WAS ANOTHER WIN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GOP

Imagine that any candidate had agreed with President Barack Obama’s original 2008 position that “I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.”

Or imagine that a candidate had defended ObamaCare as the solution to health care in America.

When the last two Democratic presidents can no longer be defended by the men and women hoping to become the next Democratic president, something profound has happened.

We have already seen the old Democratic Party (and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. James Clyburn of South Caroline literally represent the old Democratic Party) being eclipsed by “the Squad.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is now the spiritual leader of House Democrats. And every major Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed radical Green New Deal-type proposals that would expand government, destroy the energy industry, radically change America, and plunge the economy into a depression.

The Democratic-Socialist Party wants to outlaw private health insurance, punish the successful (especially the wealthy), and expand government control over virtually everything.

In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.

The Democratic-Socialist candidates embrace policies ranging from wanting to confiscate guns; forcing the radical California gender curriculum on every state; removing the tax exemption for every church, synagogue, and mosque that defines marriage as between a man and a woman; providing free (meaning taxpayer-funded) health care to people living in our country illegally; and opening the border so anyone and everyone will be able to enter the United States without having to worry about immigration laws.

Some of these radical candidates favor tax-paid sex-change operations in prison – and genderless prisons (one of Biden’s contributions to the dialogue) so male criminals could declare themselves female to be sent to women’s prisons.

Imagine that one of the candidates had said he or she was against abortion. The result might have been a riot – and at a minimum an expulsion of the heretic. Instead, the new Democratic-Socialist Party stands for abortion on the last day of pregnancy, and its most radical acolytes are now for infanticide after delivery as long as “the infant would be kept comfortable” (see the New York state law endorsed by the Democratic governor of Virginia).

Almost equally heretical would have been a candidate defending Columbus Day (favored by 57 percent to 29 percent of the public, with the Democratic-Socialists once again in a position favored by about a quarter of the country).

Imagine that candidate attacking the National Education Association’s pledge that “educators must acknowledge the existence of White supremacy culture as a primary root cause of institutional racism, structural racism, and White privilege. ...the Association will actively advocate for social and educational strategies fostering the eradication of institutional racism and White privilege perpetuated by White supremacy culture.”

White supremacy culture is left-wing code for American history, American exceptionalism, the rule of law, the Constitution, and the various habits and patterns that made America the most prosperous and powerful nation in history.

Can you imagine one of the candidates in the debate arguing that our schools should not be centers of anti-American indoctrination dictated by left-wing unions? Of course not. They would be booed off the stage.

As The Wall Street Journal put it in an editorial headlined “Warren and Sanders, Policy Mates.” the pattern is overwhelming:

The editorial says this about Warren and Sanders: “They both would force these companies to get a new federal charter requiring them to consider ‘stakeholders’ rather than shareholders in their business decisions. They both want to reimpose the old Glass-Steagall fence between commercial banking and investment banking. 'The business model of Wall Street is fraud,’ Mr. Sanders likes to say. Ms. Warren also thinks bankers are crooks: 'Wall Street is looting the economy.’ They agree the U.S. Postal Service should become a bank that offers government checking accounts and would compete with private banks.

“On college as an entitlement, the two again see eye to eye. 'It’s time to cancel student debt and make universal free college a reality,’ one says. The other reverses the order: 'We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free, and cancel all student debt.’ For the record, Ms. Warren’s plan is the first one.”

There are a scattered handful of traditional liberal Democrats in the House and Senate, but none have any chance of ever being a national candidate in the emerging Democratic-Socialist Party.

We are watching a historic moment in which a once-great American political party is transformed into an anti-American engine of radical change. In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.

It will be a wrenching, defining moment for the party of Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy if it is conquered by the party of AOC, Sanders and Warren.

Beto O’Rourke of Texas boiled over on Tuesday night at the fourth round Democratic primary debate.

At one point, Buttigieg, who has said that O’Rourke’s gun buyback proposal could hurt Democrats appeal with moderate voters, firmly told O'Rourke: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage.”

The two candidates have jabbed at each other in recent weeks over their differences on combating gun violence – and specifically on the merits of the mandatory assault weapons buyback program championed by O’Rourke.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR, SLAM WARREN OVER NOT ANSWERING ON HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL

Asked by the moderators at the debate at Otterbein University in Ohio how he would enforce his plan, O’Rourke answered that he expected “my fellow Americans to follow the law.”

Buttigieg, who’s criticized O’Rourke’s proposal a “shiny object” that distracts from implementing gun control steps that enjoy widespread support, argued that O’Rourke’s answer showed a lack of clarity on whether a mandatory gun buyback program could work.

And Buttigieg emphasized that “we cannot wait for purity tests…we have to just get something done.”

“This is not a purity test,” O’Rourke fired back, emphasizing that if the federal government banned the sale of assault weapons, it made sense that existing weapons need to be removed from the streets.

And he charged that Buttigieg’s “shiny object” criticism was a “slap in the face…to those who have survived gun violence, those who’ve lost a loved one to an AR-15, an AK-47.”

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

O’Rourke also indirectly suggested that was Buttigieg was being cautious on backing a mandatory buyback program due to poll testing and focus groups.

“That seemed like a fairly personal exchange,” remarked Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor.

Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee, emphasized that Buttigieg challenged anyone who questioned his boldness. ""That’s what Beto tried to do, saying ‘I’ve got the bolder idea.’ And when Buttigieg came back and said ‘don’t talk to me about boldness, don’t talk to me about courage,’ it was a very powerful moment.”

O’Rourke has made curbing gun violence central to his campaign his hometown of El Paso, Texas was rocked by a horrific mass shooting in early August.

Buttigieg’s plan to reduce gun violence calls for universal background checks, implementing ""red flag"" gun laws, and banning the sales of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

With the spate of mass shootings in recent years, curbing gun violence has been a top issue in the Democratic presidential nomination race."

Here's what you need to know as you start your Thursday ...

BREAKING NEWS: U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. and House Oversight Committee chairman, died early Thursday at age 68, according to his office. Cummings' office released a statement, saying, ""At approximately 2:45 a.m. on Thursday Oct. 17, 2019, Congressman Elijah E. Cummings (MD-07) passed away at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications concerning longstanding health challenges."" Stay with Fox News for further developments

Pelosi, Trump accuse each other of 'meltdown' after Dems storm out of Syria meeting

One thing is clear after top Democrats stormed out of a White House meeting with President Trump on Wednesday: The tension between the president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has reached a boiling point -- and now observers wonder if they’ll ever be able to work together.

Afterward, Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer held an impromptu news conference outside the White House, telling reporters they walked out of the meeting on Syria policy after Trump allegedly called Pelosi either a ""third-rate politician"" or ""third-grade politician"" and angrily suggested the Democrats probably appreciated communist Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East.

""What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., said. She added later, at the Capitol: ""I pray for the president all the time, and I tell him that -- I pray for his safety and that of his family. Now, we have to pray for his health -- because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.""

A senior Democratic aide told Fox News that Trump began the meeting by remarking that ""someone wanted this meeting so I agreed to it."" Trump also reportedly told Pelosi, ""I hate ISIS more than you do,"" prompting Pelosi to respond, ""You don't know that."" The meeting devolved after that point, according to several sources. As the Democrats walked out, Trump reportedly remarked, ""I'll see you at the polls.""

Trump, for his part, tweeted photos from the meeting, including one showing Pelosi standing across the table from him and pointing her finger at the president. Trump captioned the photo, ""Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!"" (Pelosi later used that photo on her official Twitter account.) Click here for more on this story.

Trump tells Turkey’s Erdogan, ‘Don’t be a tough guy,’ ahead of visit from Pence, Pompeo: Before the dramatic developments at the White House, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday he will speak to Vice President Mike Pence and a U.S. delegation heading to Ankara over a potential ceasefire deal in Syria after apparently snubbing the group earlier in the morning. Pence, heading a U.S. contingent that includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien, was set to arrive in Turkey on Thursday. House lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan resolution opposing Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria. Fox Business' Trish Regan exclusively obtained a letter from Trump to Erdogan, urging him, “Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool,” and ""work out a good deal!""

Biden ramps up attacks on Warren, dismisses her as a fellow front-runner

One day after arguably being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ debate in Ohio, Joe Biden downplayed her recent gains in the polls and repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of her as a ""co-front-runner."" “I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,” Biden said. “You guys keep talking about that.”

Biden's new attacks on Warren come as it appears every member of the ""Squad"" may not be ""all in"" on endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., just yet.

Rick Perry contacted Giuliani at Trump's direction on concerns about Ukraine corruption: Wall Street Journal

Energy Secretary Rick Perry, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said President Trump directed him to seek out his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani this spring to address the president's concerns about alleged Ukrainian corruption. The Journal reported that Perry ""said he contacted Mr. Giuliani in an effort to ease a path to a meeting between Mr. Trump and his new Ukrainian counterpart"" and that there were concerns about Ukraine's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Perry told the Journal he never heard Trump or Giuliani discuss the possibility of investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Chicago teachers expected to strike after rejecting contract offer

The Chicago Teacher’s Union rejected a final contract offer from Chicago Public Schools on Wednesday, making it likely that more than 25,000 teachers and support personnel will strike beginning Thursday. Nearly 400,000 students and families stand to be affected. Classes were preemptively canceled Thursday due to the prospect of a job action, though school buildings were scheduled to remain open and meals will be served.

Megyn Kelly calls on NBC to have 'outside investigator' probe shocking sex allegations

In her first televised interview since leaving NBC News last year, Megyn Kelly told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson that the Peacock Network needs an ""outside investigator"" to probe the shocking sexual misconduct allegations made by some former NBC employees. ""There needs to be an outside investigation into this company,” Kelly told Carlson. “They investigated themselves. That doesn't work.”

In his new book, ""Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,"" Pulitzer-winning journalist Ronan Farrow details the resistance he says he faced from his former bosses at NBC News while reporting on disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein. The book exposes several allegations against former “Today” anchor Matt Lauer. Farrow contends top executives knew about the accusations longer than they claimed and were intent on quashing allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein and simultaneously keeping a lid on claims against Lauer.

Once again, the debate stage showcased a lackluster group of extremist politicians pandering to their far-left base of support with harmful policy proposals that are way outside the mainstream.

The three septuagenarian candidates currently making up the top tier of the Democratic field include a confused and corrupt former Vice President Joe Biden some 20 years past his prime; unelectable socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who recently suffered a heart attack; and hopelessly out-of-touch former Harvard professor and current Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who wants to throw 180 million Americans off their private health insurance plans, including union workers.

Stuck with a field marred with enormous electability questions, no one is paying closer attention to the weakest field of presidential candidates in recent memory than 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

These two nationally recognized liberals are likely thinking the same thing as everyone else: none of the 12 mediocre candidates on the stage in Ohio Tuesday night has what it takes to defeat President Trump in November 2020.

After watching the three-hour snooze fest, here are some of the takeaways that Clinton and Bloomberg may be thinking about as they consider jumping into the presidential race.

The Democratic candidates are desperately lurching farther and farther to the left. This strategy of embracing extremism is clearly designed to capture the hearts and minds of the Democratic primary electorate by repackaging the tired Big Government policies of the past. Capitalism and liberty have become dirty words with this crowd. Look no further than new reports Tuesday night that Green New Deal author and socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – along with radical Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota – plan to endorse Sanders for president. Throughout history, socialism has failed at every turn and will fail once again as the Democrat’s party platform in the 2020 general election.

Joe Biden’s son Hunter and his shady foreign business dealings were glossed over and badly mischaracterized. This should have been the big issue of the night. Serious allegations against the Bidens are being whitewashed by a biased mainstream media that has gone headfirst into the dishonesty tank during the Trump administration.

The impeachment witch hunt led the discussion because the Democratic Party has no positive agenda. All the candidates reminded viewers about the partisan nature of the baseless impeachment inquiry against President Trump by rushing to judgment before getting the facts. It’s become clear that impeachment is being pushed because desperate Democrats can’t defeat Trump at the ballot box in less than 13 months.

Democrats are offering the American people big tax increases, job-killing over-regulation, and lawless open borders. These failed and harmful ideas aren’t polling well with voters. But the far-left Democrats are so committed to Big Government that they ignore the fact that their plans would wreck the vibrant Trump economy and punish American families and businesses.

“Medicare-for-all,” championed by Sanders, is so extreme that even some of the Democratic presidential candidates oppose it. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., pointed out that the disastrous proposal would result in a “multitrillion-dollar hole” in the federal budget. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called the irresponsible plan a “pipedream.” They’re both right.

The debate will not change the trajectory of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Nothing happened to suggest someone had a breakout moment and will show real upward movement in the polls. The top tier will remain Warren, Biden and Sanders.

Despite the best efforts of Democrats, President Trump’s amazing accomplishments to improve the lives of the American people simply cannot be explained away. The national unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is at a 50-year low and the unemployment rates for women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans are at historic lows. Over 6 million jobs have been created on President Trump’s watch – including 500,000 manufacturing jobs – and a record number of Americans are currently employed. To paraphrase former President Bill Clinton, elections are about the strong economy – and continued prosperity.

In a debate that featured barely a spark – much less fireworks – there’s ample reason for Democratic power brokers around the country to be concerned about where the current overcrowded field is headed. So they might be looking for other options before the Iowa caucuses kick off voting for the presidential candidates in February.

Here’s the reality:

Job creators, entrepreneurs and investors alike know that President Trump at his core thinks like a pro-growth businessman, and that gives them confidence to make decisions that expand their businesses.

On trade, President Trump’s vision and leadership have changed opinions on how we approach China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. The president knows there is a difference between free trade and fair trade when it comes to prioritizing American workers.

In Tuesday night’s debate in the critical Rust Belt state of Ohio – as the Democrats highlighted their failed vision of tax increases, overregulation, and giving away the store to China – the contrast with the positive Trump record couldn’t be starker.

Well-known liberal egotists Clinton and Bloomberg certainly think a lot of themselves and despite their baggage could probably fare better against President Trump than the current slate of boring Democrat wannabes.

And if the Democrats really want to recreate the 2008 Obama coalition, there’s another candidate who could immediately become the party’s frontrunner due to nostalgia alone. Her name is Michelle Obama. But the problem with nostalgia is that we tend to remember what we liked and forget what we didn’t like.

The clear reality emerging at the end of the long debate was that these are desperate times for a Democratic Party suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.

Barely registering the polls and with less than $700,000 of campaign cash on hand, the former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama is facing the possibility that his appearance at the debate at Otterbein University in suburban Columbus, Ohio may well be the last time he makes the stage.

BUTTIGIEG AND O'ROURKE CLASH OVER GUNS DURING DEBATE

Castro grabbed only 8.2 minutes of speaking time at the debate – the third least amount among the record-setting 12 candidates on the stage – and didn’t score a breakout moment.

But in an interview with Fox News in the spin room following the debate, Castro vowed that he’ll fight on even if fails to make November’s cut and optimistically said he’ll qualify for the next debate.

“I’m going to keep fighting on. I believe that with hard work, we can make the next debate in Atlanta. We have about three and a half weeks to do that. So I’m going to keep working hard to get there,” he said.

Castro’s comments stand in contrast to his dire warning to supporters in a fundraising email late last week.

""I don’t say this lightly: If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign,"" Castro emphasized.

FOX NEWS' BRETT BAIER ON DEBATE WINNERS AND LOSERS

To date, eight candidates say they’ve qualified: They are – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman and progressive and environmental advocate Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

After the debate, it was hard to find a political pundit who praised Castro’s performance.

But asked by Fox News if his debate performance helped him in his goal to make the next debate stage, the candidate said, “I think so. It’s always a scramble for time with 12 people up there but I made the best use of the time that I did get. I was very sharp on issues that people care about and I think that will make a difference.”

And he touted on Twitter that “donations are coming in from all around the country.”

Castro also took aim at the media hosts for the debate - CNN and the New York Times – telling reporters in the spin room and highlighting on Twitter that there were “three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.”"

“It’s a free country — ideas, float them, fly them, run it up the old flag pole and see who salutes. In the end, you’ve got millionaires arguing with millionaires over who hates the millionaires the most,” the TV show host said.

The former ""Dirty Jobs"" host then segued into a story about Ronald Reagan’s acting career to further clarify his viewpoint.

“One of the stories they tell [at the Reagan ranch] is the time when Ronald Reagan just finally decided he was done doing movies,"" Rowe said. ""He was just done because he was paying 92 percent of every dollar he made on films. It was just math.”

“He wasn’t done acting,"" he continued. ""He just looked at it and did some basic calculus and said, 'Not for me anymore. Makes no sense to do this.'”

Kilmeade then joined in, pondering if the concept of free money is damaging to one’s self-esteem.

“You can’t ignore the human condition. We’re fundamentally lazy people. We have to be taught, I think, to not be lazy,"" Rowe answered. ""I’m just saying that if you give me a choice — and I don’t see myself as lazy — but if you give me a choice of the easy way or the hard way, I can’t help it. I’m going to default to the easy way. Free money? I want it.”

“My biggest concern with that kind of arguing is… once you say okay, free money, the next question has to be, 'Why not more?'”

“The book… started as a collection of stories I write for my podcast,"" he said. “My mother read them and said, 'These are very nice but it’s a rather lazy approach to writing, don’t you think? Publishing something you’ve already read.' In between each story about a famous person I’ve never met but I’m intrigued by, I tell a story of my own misspent youth. The book goes between autobiography and biography. It’s a memoir interrupted by some nonfiction stories about some famous people I wish I knew a little better.”"

THE CHAOS CAUCUS GETS ITS WAY

If you read this note you certainly have more than a passing interest in politics. In fact, you’re probably one of the people to whom your friends and family turn when it comes to sorting out questions political or governmental.



That's why one of our goals each day is to so equip you. We like it if you’re the smartest political person in the room.



So if they ask you today what in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks is going on, just tell them this: The two most powerful people in the American government – the system conceived by the Founders, purchased and defended with the lives of more than a million men at arms – is the specific insult the president used toward the speaker of the house.



Hoo-boy…



President Trump said that he called Nancy Pelosi a “third-grade politician.” Pelosi and others at the brief, useless meeting on the ongoing debacle in Syria say that Trump called her a “third-rate politician.”



We will not waste your time or test your credulity by talking about how unworthy this is of our republic or of the armed forces the two were supposedly meeting to discuss, or any of that “School House Rock” goody-goody stuff. It’s 2019. We get it.



But ask yourselves what comes next.



On the 1,000th day of Trump’s presidency we find a city and a system unraveled. If we take the long view we can observe that this is, in fact, what Americans voted for in 2016. Trump promised to bring combative, disruptive partisan warfare to levels unseen even during recent low points like the Clinton impeachment and the Iraq War.



Trump has delivered on his promise to disrupt, a promise he made to core supporters starting in June 2015. One of the reasons that his devotees are attached to him in a way that sometimes border on the religious is because he has kept faith with these voters every day of his presidency. Trump likes to boast that he is a builder, but his base hired him for a demolition job.



To win the presidency, though, Trump relied on the support of voters who felt differently – a bloc at least as large as his core followership. The mandate from these voters was not to turn Washington into an apocalyptic hellscape of turgid partisanship but rather just not be Hillary Clinton.



We imagine that those voters have watched the events of the past two months in some combination of fascination, shock, amusement and horror. The cause of such consternation is pretty simple: There is very little left in Trump’s administration that reflects the winning coalition of 2016 between Trump’s populist pitchforkers and the center-right Republican establishment.



Think of it this way – Trump succeeded in an audacious hostile takeover of the Republican Party. But after the establishment was defeated, many members of the old firm stayed on in this new joint venture.



Reince Priebus, Nikki Haley, James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, Kirstjen Nielsen, Jeff Sessions, Tom Price, Elaine Chao, Dan Coats, Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pence all hitched up for the new joint venture between Trump Inc. and the GOP.



It’s down to Mulvaney, Chao and Pence, and if we were Mulvaney we wouldn’t worry about renewing our parking pass for next month.



What that means is that Trump is substantially getting the government he wanted and promised, one in which he is unconstrained by convention, tradition or nearly any rules of the road. He envisioned that as president he could operate in the same way he did as the CEO of his family business.



Of course, as it turns out, he cannot. But he has run out of those individuals who, for the first 900-or-so days, managed to make things run in some kind of orderly way.



Consider the twin snares in which Trump now finds himself bound: Impending impeachment and the foreign policy meltdown in Syria. Both are the result of Trump doing things his way rather than the Washington way.



Any chief of staff worth his salt would have dived in front of that phone call to the Ukrainian president like it was a runaway dump truck. Whether you think Trump acted appropriately or not, he conducted himself in such a way that gave his critics all the ammunition that they needed. One day after Robert Mueller’s testimony snuffed out the already dying embers of impeachment talk in Congress, Trump picked up the phone and started a conflagration.



Any national security adviser in any previous administration would have done everything but swat the phone out of the president’s hand if he was telling Turkey’s strongman president that the U.S. would clear the way for Turkish forces to pummel our Kurdish allies.



Again, you may actually agree with the policy of feeding the Kurds to the Turks, but we are left in a situation where the American Air Force is bombing American military installations to keep them out of the hands of rapidly advancing hostile forces. Those are procedural, not policy problems.



The next 12 months will determine what, if any, legacy Trump will leave behind. Trump re-elected, Trump defeated, Trump impeached but preserved by the Senate and Trump impeached and removed are all real possibilities. And no one will have as much to say about which of those eventualities comes to pass as Trump himself.



His team is in disarray and his administration lurches daily from disaster to disaster. If he does not find a way to change that it won’t matter how bad the Democrats’ nominee is, Trump will never see a second term.



Given the fact that today’s White House press conference was to announce Trump’s decision to host world leaders next year at one of his family’s golf resorts, we get the sense that maybe that reality has not yet taken root in the West Wing.



THE RULEBOOK: FOCUS ON THE POSITIVES

“They have chosen rather to dwell on the inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all political advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be incident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can be made.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 41



TIME OUT: TIMELESS JULIE ANDREWS

Atlantic: “Home Work, [Julie Andrews] second memoir (this one co-published with her eldest daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton), is an account of what happened between Andrews’s film debut in 1964’s Mary Poppins and her performance in the 1982 movie Victor/Victoria. The motivation for the book, Andrews told [The Atlantic], was twofold. After the 2008 publication of her first memoir, Home, which detailed her difficult childhood and her earliest days as a performer, fans and friends had urged her to dive into the next phase. ‘The first one ended as I was heading to Hollywood,’ she said, ‘so of course everybody said, ‘When, when, when are you going to do the next one?’ Because they wanted to hear all that.’ Home, in other words, ended right before the moment when Andrews took the role that would change her life. The book is a dance between candor and diplomacy, as Andrews navigates the imperative of honesty with the courteousness that seems to be her governing instinct.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: RESTING PETE FACE

This week Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt give their thoughts on the fourth Democratic Presidential primary debate, the continued controversy between the NBA and China and Dana has fun with Chris's new memoji. Plus, Chris answers some primary trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



OUTPOURING FOR ELIJAH CUMMINGS, LION OF THE HOUSE

Baltimore Sun: “U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Baltimore, a committee chairman known for his devotion to Baltimore and civil rights and for blunt and passionate speechmaking, died of longstanding health problems early Thursday morning, his office said. He was 68 years old. The Democrat, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, at approximately 2:45 A.M., a spokeswoman said. Cummings, who had been absent from Capitol Hill in recent weeks while under medical attention, had health issues in recent years. In 2017, he underwent an aortic valve replacement. The procedure, which aides described as minimally invasive in Cummings’ case, is used to correct narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart. The surgery led to an infection that kept him in the hospital longer than expected.”



LATE IN THE RACE, DEM FAULT LINES EMERGE

WaPo: “As the party’s fourth debate concluded, the Democratic primary contest opened a more robust and unpredictable clash over the ideological direction of the party, with moderates attempting to ignite the kind of passion that the liberal candidates have harnessed with large crowds and grass-roots donor networks. After months in which the race was largely static amid a crowded, free-ranging field, the nomination fight is showing signs of narrowing its focus to fewer candidates, divided into parallel feuds in the liberal and moderate wings of the party. [Elizabeth] Warren (Mass.) is entering a crucial phase of her campaign, taking attacks from all sides for the first time since she ascended in popularity, and attempting to demonstrate she can withstand the kind of scrutiny that previously fell mostly on [Joe] Biden, who until recently held an unchallenged lead in the polls. Yet as she attempts to coalesce support on the party’s left flank, Warren faces a renewed challenge from liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)… The left’s feud is replicated in the center, where Biden faces challenges from [Pete] Buttigieg, [Amy] Klobuchar and others.”



Biden dismisses Warren as a fellow front-runner - Fox News: “One day after being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ latest debate, Joe Biden repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary front-runner alongside the former vice president. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ‘co-front-runner.’ ‘I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,’ Biden said. ‘You guys keep talking about that.’ Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that ‘Warren has done very well. She’s moved.’”



RNC raises record-setting $27.3 million in September - Fox News: “The Republican National Committee raised a record-setting $27.3 million in September and had $59.2 million cash on hand last month amid the impeachment push against President Trump -- which has fueled GOP campaign contributions heading into the 2020 election. The RNC’s September fundraising haul is the best off-cycle month in the history of both the Republican and Democratic parties. This cycle, to date, the RNC has almost tripled the Democratic National Committee’s fundraising efforts, according to the GOP, which also noted that the Democrats, as of last month, carried $7.3 million in debt. ‘While Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month—the highest ever off-cycle—to show for it,’ RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News.”



DEMS FACE TIMING QUESTION WITH IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “Democrats are in an impeachment bind. For the first time, they’re receiving a gusher of evidence to support charges that President Donald Trump abused his power for political and personal gain, pressuring Ukraine’s fledgling government to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But as more witnesses come forward to spill more secrets, the more Democrats are nervously eyeing the dwindling congressional calendar and wondering: When should we be satisfied with what we have and bring articles of impeachment to the floor? … Some Democrats say the investigation should continue until the evidence is so overwhelming it pries loose a few Republican votes, delivering a symbolic victory as Democrats hold out hope that impeachment isn’t a purely party-line issue. Others believe Democrats should exhaust the list of willing witnesses before drafting formal articles. And still others say the House already has enough evidence to move forward with impeachment immediately — from Trump’s own admission…”



McConnell readies party members for impeachment trial - WaPo: “Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican senators Wednesday to be ready for an impeachment trial of President Trump as soon as Thanksgiving, as the Senate began to brace for a political maelstrom that would engulf the nation. An air of inevitability has taken hold in Congress, with the expectation Trump will become the third president in history to be impeached — and Republicans believe they need to prepare to defend the president. While McConnell briefed senators on what would happen during a Senate trial, House GOP leaders convened what they expect will be regular impeachment strategy sessions. In their closed-door weekly luncheon, McConnell gave a PowerPoint presentation about the impeachment process and fielded questions alongside his staff and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who was a manager for the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.”



Perry says Trump sent him to Giuliani - Fox News: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose name has been mentioned in connection with President Trump’s Ukraine dealings, said in an interview published late Wednesday that the president told him to seek out Rudy Giuliani earlier this year to look into possible Ukrainian corruption. The Wall Street Journal sat down with Perry for an extensive interview and reported that the spring conversation was a sign of how closely Giuliani — a personal lawyer for Trump — worked on Ukraine policy. Giuliani's business dealings with the country were reportedly looked at by federal investigators. He denied any wrongdoing. ‘Visit with Rudy,’ Perry recalled Trump telling him. He told the paper that Trump was not convinced that Kiev ‘straightened up’ its act. Perry told the paper he never heard Trump or Giuliani talk about an investigation into the Bidens.”



Volker’s testimony revealed more concerns about Giuliani - Axios: “New details from Kurt Volker's closed-door interview indicate Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, was deeply conflicted about whether to take the job because of concerns about Rudy Giuliani's shadow involvement. Why it matters: The testimony by Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, earlier this month may help the president in the sense that it paints Giuliani, not President Trump, as the mastermind behind a campaign to get foreign leaders to investigate the Biden family and Burisma, according to sources with direct knowledge of his testimony. But it also amplifies concerns that Trump was more interested in what his personal lawyer had to say than the professionals in government. Taylor was also worried that Trump might be willing to trade away Ukraine's interests as part of a grand bargain with Russia, Volker told lawmakers. Taylor is expected to appear before members of Congress next week.”



The Judge’s Ruling: It’s impeachable if the House says it is - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains if President Trump right when he says the impeachment inquiry is unfair: “The illegitimacy argument contended that since the House has yet to vote to authorize an investigation of the president, its committees lack subpoena power. This argument contends that since impeachment seeks to overturn a valid election, it is a thinly veiled coup and thus is in violation of the Constitution. And the argument about unfairness states that the president is entitled to due process at every stage of the impeachment proceedings. These are valid political arguments. But as legal offerings, they are profoundly misguided. … Impeachment is always constitutional if it originates in the House and if its basis is arguably for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” More here.

FLEA MARKET CHEESE? REALLY?

Fresno [Calif.] Bee: “Lemoore [Calif.] police are investigating the theft of $50,000 in cheese in a crime that is believed to reach back to 2017. The investigation, launched in late August, centers around products from Leprino Foods Plant in the 300 block of Belle Haven Drive in the South Valley city. A police spokeswoman said multiple subjects have been linked to the thefts and the cheese has been sold from Fresno to Riverside counties: door-to-door, on the street, at flea markets and on social media sites. After serving warrants, detectives recovered a large amount of cheese and arrested Jairo Mariano Osorio Alvarez, 24, and Roderick Domingo Ransom, 34, both of Lemoore.”

Moody's report, tweeted out on Tuesday, said early signs point to a Trump victory mostly fueled by a strong economy. However, the results will depend on voter turnout.

""Our 2020 Presidential Election Models: Early signs point to Trump, though turnout is key,"" the tweet read.

The report states that Trump has the advantage in several forecast models such as the economy, personal finances, and energy prices.

""The current environment of stable to low gas prices favors Trump in his reelection bid. Moreover, the baseline forecast calls for gasoline prices to dip slightly in the year leading up to the 2020 election,"" the report reads.

THERE'S 'MATERIAL CHANCE' TRUMP WILL BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE, SAYS MSNBC GUEST

""Finances matter here as well, as voters who feel better off from real and not just nominal, wage gains are more likely to express comfort in the status quo. This measure also favors Trump.""

The report also claims Trump would win in a massive landslide if voter sentiment about their pocketbooks was the main factor that drove them to the polls.

""If voters were to vote primarily on the basis of their pocketbooks, the president would steamroll the competition, taking home 351 electoral votes to the Democrats’ 187, assuming average voter turnout,"" the document states. ""This shows the importance that prevailing economic sentiment at the household level could hold in the next election.""

Moody's said Trump's fluctuating approval ratings will not work against him and are comparable to past presidents who have won reelection. They also say a strong stock market will help the president, even if it is not directly tied to economic growth.

SARAH SANDERS: DEMS ON DEBATE STAGE KNEW WARREN IS FRONTRUNNER AND BIDEN IS 'FINISHED'

The caveat comes in the form of voter turnout. The report claims that if turnout among Democrats and independents match their maximum historical highs, Trump would lose in a tight race.

""An average of the three sets of model results suggests that if turnout of nonincumbent voters in 2020 matches the historical high across states, then Democrats would win a squeaker with 279 electoral votes to the president’s 259,"" the report reads.

""Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Minnesota and New Hampshire would all flip from Trump’s column versus our average turnout baseline.""

Moody's stated that the country's continued economic upswing is vital to a Trump victory, but also claimed America is at risk of heading into a financial downturn, as part of an impending global recession, in the next 12-18 months.

“I think risks are awfully high that if something doesn’t stick to script then we do have a recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “I’ll say this also: Even if we don’t have a recession over the next 12-18 months, I think it’s pretty clear that we’re going to have a much weaker economy.”

Moody's said they have corrected their turnout models from 2016, which caused the forecast to incorrectly predict a victory by Hillary Clinton."

""This is a newly prosperous Middle America and it is Middle America that decides elections."" — Stuart Varney, Fox Business host

""This is a newly prosperous Middle America and it is Middle America that decides elections,"" said Varney on his Fox Nation show ""My Take.""

According to a study by Sentier Research, the country's middle class has seen a $5,000 annual increase in income under the Trump administration, totaling the median household income to approximately $66,000.

""Trump up $5,000 in three years; Bush, Obama up $1,500 in 16 years,"" observed Varney.

Varney believes the latest report will not play well for 2020 progressive candidates, who are ""unable to acknowledge Trump's success.""

""The socialists running for the presidency repeat their tired old cliches about 'the rich getting richer and you gotta work two or three jobs to make ends meet'...they can't say that tax cuts, deregulations, and cheap energy haven't brought prosperity... they can't say it,"" said Varney.

VARNEY: SANDERS' HOSPITALIZATION MAY TIP NOMINATION TO WARREN

""To acknowledge that means to acknowledge the success of Trump's policies and that's something no Democrat can do,"" Varney continued.

""It's the Democrats' dilemma,"" he added. ""How do you run against prosperity?""

Varney questioned whether the Democrats' ""current tactics"" are enough to ""beat the extra money in America's pocket.""

""You call the president names, you try to impeach him, you stomp your feet and you say, 'Oh, I just can't stand him,'"" said Varney, ""but does all of that beat extra money in Middle America's pocket? And will Middle America take a leap in the dark for socialism?"" he asked.

""It's hard to imagine that we will abandon the system that's made this country wealthy just because of the president's style and tone,"" Varney continued.

But it's the tangled tale of his middle child Hunter that threatens to scuttle the former vice president's third bid for the White House.

In Democratic circles, there have been whispers for years that Hunter Biden could become a liability for his father. Questions about the younger Biden's overseas business dealings in Ukraine and China as well as his checkered past at home -- he dated his brother's widow, used cocaine, bought crack and allegedly spent so much money in strip clubs and on prostitutes that his family couldn't pay their bills -- has made him an easy target for President Trump.

Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry, has aggressively gone after chief rival Biden and his family. Some accusations the president has lobbed can be proved. The majority cannot.

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

What's true is that Hunter Biden has become a punching bag for the White House and Trump's closest allies. The 49-year-old's controversial decision to accept a high-paying position at a gas company in Ukraine with little to no experience has become the backdrop of a whistleblower complaint against Trump and is reshaping the 2020 presidential race. Trump has repeatedly accused Hunter Biden of ethical lapses and profiting off his famous father's last name -- something Trump's own children have been widely criticized for doing.

FOX NEWS POLL: RECORD SUPPORT FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT

Earlier this week, Trump tweeted, ""Where's Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raised and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.""

The social media hits against the Bidens made by a sitting president have been relentless and somewhat shifted the focus of the investigation against Trump to an attack on Hunter Biden.

On Tuesday, the younger Biden finally broke his silence, acknowledging in an ABC interview that his last name likely played a role in getting a lucrative Ukraine gig while his father was vice president and handled the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. However, he strongly pushed back on growing criticism from Republicans and the White House that he was unqualified for the positions he held on several boards.

HUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON UKRAINE BUSINESS DEALS, CLAIMS HE DID 'NOTHING WRONG AT ALL'

Hunter Biden argued that despite a lack of Ukraine or natural gas industry experience he ""had as much knowledge as anybody else on the board, if not more.""

When Hunter Biden joined the board of the gas company a half-decade ago, its owner, a former Ukrainian government minister working to rebuild Burisma Holdings' image, was facing a money-laundering investigation. In fact, the region was so rife with corruption that one of Hunter Biden's investment firm partners at the time ended his business relationship with Biden. Despite warnings of corruption, Hunter Biden stayed on and pulled in $50,000 a month, Newsweek reported.

His colleagues at Burisma included chairman Alan Apter, who had nearly three decades of experience under his belt at Merrill Lynch, Renaissance Capital, Troika Dialog and Morgan Stanley. Devon Archer, who was appointed as director of Burisma in 2014, co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners with Biden. He also served as a senior adviser to John Kerry and co-chaired the National Financial Committee.

There have also been concerns about Hunter Biden's dealings with BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company. Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani claimed that Biden used his father's position as vice president to secure $1.5 billion in loans for the Chinese private equity company, where he was a board member. There is currently no credible evidence to support the theory.

Still, earlier this week Joe Biden pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were elected to be president.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG.'

""Look, my son's statement speaks for itself,"" Biden said, adding that he never acted improperly based on payments his son was receiving from several multinational companies.

While father and son have denied any wrongdoing, Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings and drama stateside have had an impact on Biden's bid for the White House.

""Did I make a mistake? Maybe in the grand scheme of things. But did I make a mistake based on some ethical lapse? Absolutely not,"" Hunter Biden said during the ABC interview.

The powerful politician's son's woes back home have put him in the spotlight for years. And though he's been open about his drug and alcohol abuse, his bio reads like a tabloid tale, sometimes almost too out there to believe.

Hunter Biden got his law degree from Yale Law in 1996. He returned to Delaware to help his dad who was running for reelection in the Senate. and was tapped to be Biden's deputy campaign manager. He also was a lawyer with MBNA America, a banking holding company in Delaware, which happened to be one of the biggest donors to his father's campaign.

At the age of 43, Hunter Biden applied for and received an age waiver to join the Navy Reserve after being inspired by his friend Greg Keeley, an Australian-American former military officer. Keeley wrote him a letter of recommendation. The Navy has a zero-tolerance drug-and-alcohol abuse policy and asks all recruits about their prior substance use. Hunter Biden disclosed that he had used drugs in the past but said he was sober and got a second waiver from the Navy to join.

In early 2013, Hunter Biden, who had been sober for a couple of years, suffered a relapse after he was prescribed painkillers for shingles. When his prescription ran out, he began drinking again, The New Yorker reported.

On May 7, 2013 he was assigned to a Reserve unit at Naval Station Norfolk. He had hoped to work in naval intelligence but was given a job in a public affairs unit.

During his first weekend on duty, Hunter Biden stopped by a D.C. bar. He said he bummed a cigarette from two South African men and that he felt ""amped up"" at first but then exhausted as he made the three-hour drive to Norfolk. On his first day as a Navy reservist, he had a routine urine sample taken. A couple of months later he got the news that he had failed the drug test and that trace amounts of cocaine had been detected, The New Yorker reported. He was formally discharged on Feb.18, 2014.

In August 2015, Breitbart reported that Hunter Biden had set up an account on Ashley Madison, a website that connects married people who want to have affairs. The site was hacked and a list of subscribers was made public. Biden vehemently denied setting up the account and said that the profile that used his email address did not belong to him.

""I am certain that the account in question is not mine,"" Biden said. ""This account was clearly set up by someone else without my knowledge.""

Two months later, Hunter Biden and his wife Kathleen, who he married in 1993, separated. On Dec. 9, 2016, she filed for divorce. On Feb. 23, 2017, Kathleen filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court seeking to freeze Hunter Biden's assets. She claimed in a motion that was leaked to the New York Post that her husband had put the family on the brink of financial ruin by spending massive amounts of money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes. Kathleen also dropped the bombshell that Hunter was dating Hallie, his late brother Beau's widow.

Hunter Biden denied paying for prostitutes and claimed he hadn't been to a strip club in years. However, in an act of defiance, he told The New Yorker that the night after the Post article was published he ""went directly to a strip club. I said, 'f--k them.'""

As his divorce was playing out in public, his relationship with Hallie started to crumble.

""All we got is sh-t from everybody, all the time,'"" The New Yorker reported him as saying.

In 2016, Hunter Biden was supposed to go to a wellness center in Arizona but instead stayed in Los Angeles for about a week. In L.A. he purportedly asked a homeless man in Pershing Square where he could buy crack. Hunter told The New Yorker that the man took him to a nearby homeless encampment where someone put a gun to his head before realizing Hunter Biden was a prospective customer. After that incident, Hunter Biden said, he returned to buy more crack a few more times that week.

While in L.A., Hunter Biden also lost control of his rental car, damaged it and ended up calling the rental agency.

Hertz employee Zachary Romfo claimed he found a crack pipe in the car as well as a line of white powder residue on one of the consoles. Hertz notified the police and a narcotics offense report was filed. The report listed the items seized from Hunter's car, which included a plastic baggie containing a white powdery substance, a Secret Service business card, credit cards and Hunter Biden's driver's license.

His messy personal life complimented his complicated professional life.

On Aug. 23, 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama publicly introduced Joe Biden as his running mate. Hunter Biden claimed that during the primaries some of Obama's advisers had been criticizing him to reporters. He told The New Yorker that he wasn't told to end his lobbying activities but that he knew ""the writing was on the wall.""

Hunter Biden dropped his lobbying clients and stepped down from an unpaid seat on the board of Amtrak.

""I wanted my father to have a clean slate,"" Hunter Biden said. ""I didn't want to limit him in any way.""

Since then, the younger Biden has been in the spotlight and his past actions have come back to haunt him and his father.

He told The New Yorker that recently he had seen reports on Twitter that Trump was calling for him to be investigated by the Justice Department. Hunter Biden said he noticed a helicopter flying above and purportedly told his wife Melissa, whom he married in 2019, ""I hope they're taking pictures of us right now. I hope it's a live feed to the president so he can see just how much I care about his tweets.""

He added, ""I told Melissa, 'I don't care. F--k you, Mr. President. Here I am, living my life'."""
491,Nancy LeTourneau,,A retreat from Medicare for All is no longer an option.,2019-10-17,Google News,Warren Has Boxed Herself in on Health Care,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/washingtonmonthly/rss/~3/1Gx1vlBJSUA/,"AFGE/Flickr

Elizabeth Warren has made a name for herself by being the candidate who has a plan for everything. That is precisely why people have taken notice of the fact that the one area where she hasn’t proposed a plan is health care. The speculation has been that, while she is vigorously supporting Medicare for All during the debates, she is leaving the door open to support other plans down the road if that position becomes a liability.

Immediately after Warren announced her candidacy, she stated that the goal was universal coverage and that there were many paths to get there. Following the September debate in which she defended Medicare for All, she said that she supported a lot of plans.

Asked if she will present her own health care plan, @senwarren says she already supports Medicare for All: ""This isn't some kind of contest"" #DemDebate https://t.co/Ffui0utwux pic.twitter.com/dIhqHZxGTK — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 13, 2019

But once again on Tuesday night, Warren repeated her vigorous defense of Medicare for All. Given that she has now done so in every debate, Walter Shapiro suggests that she might not be able to pivot.

In fact, the arena where Warren has been uncharacteristically vague is in failing to provide full details of her “I’m with Bernie” support for his Medicare for All. Her stance on the issue could be risky (particularly as she must win over upscale voters who might not want their private health insurance to be abolished). But, worse still, if Warren were to retreat now, it would seem like a patently political move rather than a principled one—which would undermine what makes her campaign so unique.

The candidate who has offered the best challenge to Medicare for All in the debates has consistently been Pete Buttigieg, with his “Medicare for All Who Want It” proposal. Here is how it is described on his web site.

Through Pete’s Medicare for All Who Want It plan, everyone will be able to opt in to an affordable, comprehensive public alternative. This affordable public plan will incentivize private insurers to compete on price and bring down costs. If private insurers are not able to offer something dramatically better, this public plan will create a natural glide-path to Medicare for All. The choice of a public plan empowers people to make their own decisions regarding the type of health care that makes sense for them by leveling the playing field between patients and the health care system. It gives the American people a choice and trusts them to set the pace at which our country moves in a better direction on health care.

Back in February, Warren said that “There are multiple bills on the floor in the United States Senate. I’ve signed onto Medicare for All. I’ve signed on to another one that gives an option for buying in to Medicaid. There are different ways we can get [to universal coverage].” But in Tuesday night’s debate, Warren referred to Buttigieg’s proposal as “Medicare for all who can afford it” and said that she would never support such a plan.

At this point, Warren is pretty much locked in to the Sanders Medicare for All plan. It grows increasingly difficult to imagine how she can back away from that position without destroying the image she wants to convey of herself as a “fighter.”"

A longtime shareholder in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold his stake and published a laundry list of complaints about the legendary investor and his conglomerate.

David Rolfe, the investing chief of Wedgewood Partners, dumped his stock after more than 20 years, according to his third-quarter letter to clients. He blamed Buffett's failure to capitalize on gains in several stocks, bad investments, and reluctance to deploy his vast pile of cash.

""Thumb-sucking has not cut the Heinz mustard during the Great Bull Market of 2009 – 2019,"" Rolfe said in the letter. ""The Great Bull could have been one helluva of an astounding career denouement for Messrs. Buffett and Munger,"" he added, referring to Buffett's partner Charlie Munger.

Buffett missed out on multiple ""layups""

""A few stocks stand out to us as considerable head-scratcher errors that should have been in Buffett's wheelhouse, and should have been good for Berkshire shareholders,"" Rolfe said.

He highlighted Mastercard's 1,521% gain and Visa's 1,137% gain between the start of the bull market on March 9, 2009, and the end of last month. Then he bemoaned the fact those two stocks together make up just 1.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. ""The current combined weighting should be 15.00%!""

Rolfe also pointed to Costco and Microsoft as missed opportunities.

""Buffett has had at his disposal unrivaled expert tutelage on each company in his hind pocket for years — but to no shareholder avail,"" he said, spotlighting the fact that Munger has been a Costco director for 22 years. Yet Berkshire Hathaway only holds a ""whopping"" 0.55% stake, Rolfe added, meaning it's largely lost out on Costco's 522% gain during the bull market.

Rolfe also criticized the so-called Oracle of Omaha for not cashing in on Microsoft's 657% stock gain over the same period, despite his close relationship with Bill Gates, the technology titan's cofounder.

""Buffett probably spends more time talking with Gates (Gates Foundation and bridge playing too) each day than he does with key Berkshire vice-chairman employees Ajit Jain and Greg Abel,"" he said.

""If Buffett can endeavor to figure out the business models of both Apple and IBM enough to pour multi-billions in stock purchases, then figuring out Microsoft's business model under sensei Gates should have been Remedial Technology 101.""

Berkshire made several bad investments

""Recent billions in capital investments in notable mistakes such as IBM, Lubrizol, Precision Castparts and Kraft do not inspire confidence that Buffett & Co. are still at the top of their game,"" Rolfe said.

Buffett bought almost $11 billion worth of IBM stock at an average price of $170 in 2011, according to CNBC, only to sell his stake in the computing giant at a loss last year. He shelled out nearly $10 billion to buy Lubrizol in 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported, then later learned one of his lieutenants at the time bought a $10 million stake in the chemicals firm before recommending it to Buffett, according to the Guardian.

Berkshire Hathaway bought Precision Castparts at a $37 billion valuation in 2016, dwarfing the industrial manufacturer's $1.5 billion in annual earnings. The industrial manufacturer's profits have been lower than projected, Buffett said at his company's annual shareholder meeting in May. Buffett also admitted to CNBC he paid too much for Heinz to acquire Kraft, and the combined group's shares have plunged amid sales declines, accounting issues, and a $15 billion write-down this year.

Buffett hasn't put his cash to work

""Berkshire's current Breaking Bad-style cash hoard,"" Rolfe said, ""continues to be a considerable impediment of growth, rather than our previous hard expectation of a valuable call option on opportunity in the hands of one of the most elite capital allocators extant.""

He criticized Berkshire Hathaway for neither sharing its more than $120 billion in cash with investors nor plowing it into the market. ""Buffett seems to abhor returning 'capital paint' to shareholders while his Berkshire canvas is still 'in paint,'"" he said. Putting the cash to work ""will be paramount if Berkshire Hathaway is to once again regain their former status as a meaningful grower over just baseline US GDP growth.""

Rolfe ended by signaling his faith in Buffett could still be restored.

""Any future conviction of ours in Berkshire Hathaway shares will closely mirror that of Buffett's own conviction in Berkshire share buybacks.

Instead, these candidates are pledging to remake America entirely. Rip out the old, which is. they're telling us, irredeemably tainted by racism, sexism and free enterprise, and replace it with something completely new and different.

At the heart of this effort is the promise of ""Medicare-for-all."" Now, you may have heard the phrase. Two of the most popular Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both have endorsed it. But what exactly does it mean? What exactly is ""Medicare-for-all""?

SANDERS ACCUSES BIDEN OF PUSHING INSURANCE INDUSTRY 'TALKING POINTS' BY SLAMMING 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

It's worth finding out. It's not a tweak to some regulation. It's not even ObamaCare, which once upon a time Democrats defended and Republicans denounced as socialism.

""Medicare-for-all"" is actual socialism, for-real socialism. Health care spending amounts to about a fifth of the entire American economy. Elizabeth Warren demands total control of all of it -- immediately. That's ""Medicare-for-all."" If it becomes law, it would amount to the largest expansion of the federal government since the second World War -- by far.

So it's worth asking how exactly all of this would work and critically, who would pay for it. Elizabeth Warren has been asked that question many times, and every time, she has refused to answer.

Matthews: I know that argument, but will you pay more in taxes? Why don't you want to answer that question because as Jake said tonight, that's a Republican talking point. It's not a Republican talking point. It's a question.

Warren: It's a question about where people are going to come out economically.

Matthews: That's not my question.

Warren: I spent --

She will not answer. She won't explain, no matter how hard she has been pressed. And as you just saw, even some fairly strident Democratic partisans have pressed her.

Warren refuses. She will not explain what it would cost or who would pay for it.

Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional, or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren anymore.

Well, now we have a credible estimate. According to a study by the Urban Institute, in just the first 10 years, Elizabeth Warren's ""Medicare-for-all"" plan would cost an additional $34 trillion.

That sounds like a lot. How much is it? Here's some perspective.

The Congressional Budget Office anticipates that the United States -- the whole United States -- will collect just $46 trillion in taxes over the same period. In other words, Elizabeth Warren's health care plan alone will consume the overwhelming majority of all tax dollars in the United States.

That's before we spend a single dollar on -- I don't know -- Social Security, education, national defense and everything else.

It's demented.

Now, you should know that the Urban Institute has no motive to attack Elizabeth Warren. It's not a right-wing think tank. It's a left-wing think tank. They likely didn't even account for the cost of one's pledge to give free health care to every illegal alien who sneaks into the country.

So who is going to pay for all of this? Well, think of it this way: $3.4 trillion a year -- that's the estimated cost. Divide that by 320 million Americans, and you get more than $10,000 per person -- not per taxpayer, per person. That means every child, every retiree, every prison inmate, everybody.

That would be the largest tax assessed in American history by far. Nothing even comes close. That would change everything. An awful lot of people would just leave the country and not come back.

So how do you pay for ""Medicare-for-all""? It's not a minor detail we can settle later. It's the single most important question about the program. Why do you think we don't have it already? Because we can't afford it.

Elizabeth Warren pretends that's irrelevant -- and to her, maybe it is irrelevant.

At some point in the last couple of years, Warren stopped functioning as a conventional senator and became a kind of Messianic figure. Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren any more.

BIDEN DEFLECTS QUESTIONS ON SON AS CNN ANCHOR HITS TRUMP'S 'FALSE ACCUSATIONS'

What’s more, the candidates challenging Warren are also-rans, mired in the single digits. So that lessens the impact of those exchanges.

Two of them had very good nights. Amy Klobuchar, shedding her Minnesota Nice approach, repeatedly challenged Warren, the first to point out that her Medicare for All plan would boot 150 million Americans off private insurance. I don’t know why the moderators don’t stress that, because Warren is outplaying them in one debate after another.

Marc Lacey of the Times tried three separate times to get Warren to concede what Bernie Sanders already has, that middle-class taxes would rise under her plan. And three times Warren deflected the question by saying the rich and big corporations would pay more for health care and the middle class would pay less, evading the tax question entirely.

It took Pete Buttigieg to call out Warren for failing to answer a simple yes-or-no question. He had perhaps his best debate of the campaign, making an eloquent pitch for moderate ideas. And his strongest moment came in an exchange on Beto O’Rourke’s gun buyback program, when he said: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.” Buttigieg, of course, is an Afghanistan war veteran.

On the other hand, he only whacked Beto, who’s going nowhere fast.

Politico’s lead story says: “The candidate who brags about having a plan for everything was pilloried for not detailing how she would pay for her most expensive proposal. She was accused — sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly — of being naive, dishonest, not adequately respecting her colleagues’ ideas, tearing people down, and failing to enact major legislation. She was attacked for believing in policies that were “punitive” and a theory of governing that was a ‘pipe dream.’”

The debate just wasn’t as rough as that lead made it sound. After all, they ended by talking about Ellen.

The Washington Post declared Warren one of its winners:

“For the first time in one of these debates, Warren found herself under sustained attack. Through a combination of debate format, Joe Biden’s leads in early polls and Warren’s unique political Teflon, she had somehow avoided it. That changed Tuesday, though. Warren was the focal point, with the other candidates all but taking their focus thoroughly off Biden. It wasn’t completely smooth sailing for Warren…but it was an affirmation that she is viewed as perhaps the front-runner now.”

Look, the reason Warren has had such a smooth ride—besides running a very good, issues-based campaign—is that the press pretty much loves her. I’ve lost track of the number of puffy profiles about how she found her voice in Oklahoma, at Harvard, as a bankruptcy lawyer, at the consumer protection agency. She is getting one-hundredth of the media scrutiny that’s been aimed at Biden, who is not a press favorite.

When that changes, you’ll know she’s the front-runner.

As for Biden, he had some strong moments, especially on Syria, but his answers about his son were weak—especially since Hunter Biden confessed to poor judgment on ABC that morning even as his dad was touting his judgment that night. Biden caught a break when Anderson Cooper followed up only once and none of the other Democrats wanted to go there.

The media consensus is that Biden had another uneven night, and he does have a tendency to trip over his words. And yet, despite poor debate reviews and having to play defense on Ukraine, he keeps holding onto his supporters.

The bottom line is that the impeachment drama will quickly drown out this debate, whose 8.3 million viewers represent another decline. There won’t be days of stories about Klobuchar or Buttigieg that might ordinarily give them a chance to break through. If either is to have a shot at becoming Warren’s main moderate rival, the Biden campaign will essentially have to collapse.

""Traffic deaths have many crying with fear,"" raps Sen. Knowsbetter in the video, ""Over 30,000 people are dying each year. This modest change I proposed must be applied -- unless of course you just want people to die.""

In less than 24 hours, the video had more than 40,000 views. As of the writing on this article, the video generated more than 1.1 million views.

""What's your assessment of the state of comedy these days and the kind of cancel culture?"" asked Gutfeld on his Fox Nation show ""One Smart Person and Greg Gutfeld.""

""You see Dave Chapelle and Bill Burr doing Netflix specials where they are basically flipping off the culture,"" Gutfeld said, ""which is so refreshing, but then you have this other side -- the Patton Oswalts of the world -- who are the comedy police. Who are saying that you can be funny but... you have to be funny within this progressive criteria.""

""I think it's mainly because people haven't taken aim at everyone yet,"" said Munasifi. ""I think a lot of the people who... have those types of opinions... that are more in line with censoring and deciding what you can and can't joke about... haven't had backlash aimed at them.""

He continued, ""I have seen reviews for [Dave Chappelle's Netflix special]. I know that they are largely negative, and the audience reviews are overwhelmingly positive, so there is definitely a disconnect between the few people in the media... and those critiquing and labeling these things... where people are actually laughing at it.""

Munasifi also told Gutfeld about his family background. He said his father escaped from Iraq in the 70s and met his mother, who emigrated from Lebanon, in the United States.

For the better part of the year, former Vice President Joe Biden dominated the polls and the other candidates in the race attacked him from the left, which is weird to see.

Biden still believed in law enforcement and international borders, and he opposed forced bussing, along with virtually every other American. So he was obviously one of those right-wing extremists from the Obama administration.

That's what they were telling you on the debate stage. It was bizarre.

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

Thankfully, that line of attack is over because Joe Biden's presidential campaign itself is in effect over. Nobody thinks Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee. Elizabeth Warren is the front-runner now. That's not contested. The race is now hers to lose.

So during Tuesday night's debate, her rivals on the stage decide to help her do just that -- lose.

Pete Buttigieg, South Bend, Ind. mayor: Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything ... except this.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.: At least Bernie is being honest here in saying how he is going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Joe Biden: I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one in this stage that has gotten anything really big done.

Klobuchar: And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.

Biden: I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it.

Klobuchar: I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

Beto O'Rourke: Sometimes, I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

She is punitive? When Beto O'Rourke, Mr. Armed Federal Agents Coming to Your House, calls you out for divisive attacks, it's time to pay attention. And in fact, he does make a fair point.

The main reason Warren has surpassed Bernie Sanders in the hearts of primary voters despite pretty close economic programs is that she is the one far more willing to descend into the filth of identity politics.

Bernie is an ideologue. There are some things that he just won't say. Elizabeth Warren will say anything.

Recently, she tweeted this: ""Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. And that starts with using correct pronouns. I'm Elizabeth. My pronouns are she/her/hers.""

In case you were wondering -- in case there was any question at all -- that kind of posturing is central to Elizabeth Warren's campaign. She is happy to tell you, and often does, that you're worth less, or you're worth more, based on how you were born.

Unfortunately, that works right now in the Democratic Party.

One thing Elizabeth Warren is not willing to say, however, is how much her single-payer government health care plan will cost -- trillions of dollars, obviously. Nobody disputes that. Nobody disputes that.

And in fact, as a mathematical matter, there's no way to raise that kind of money without hiking taxes on the middle class. It's simple arithmetic. And yet for some reason, Warren refuses to admit that.

Marc Lacey, national editor for the New York Times: You have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan ""Medicare-for-All."" Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: So I have made clear but my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.

Lacey: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been ""evasive"" about how she is going to pay for ""Medicare-for-All."" What's your response?

Buttigieg: Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.

Save that tape.

There are a lot of moments in debates that seem like a huge deal at the time. Everyone is yapping about them. But in the end, it turned out to be completely meaningless. This is not one of those moments.

Health care is always at the top of voters' concerns and so are taxes for that matter. If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

Even a post-debate MSNBC panel acknowledged as much.

Claire McCaskill, former U.S. senator: I thought she seemed a little petulant at times when she was being challenged.

Eugene Robinson, Washington Post columnist: You think, a little?

McCaskill: A little.

Robinson: As Bernie Sanders says she just won't go there, and she was pummeled for it.

Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn.org: They attacked her and she was uncomfortable. She did not handle it very well.

So was it really that bad for Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday night? We'll see.

She definitely got better treatment than Joe Biden got. Journalists don't like Joe Biden. Biden has zero allies in America's ""woke"" newsrooms. Warren, by contrast, has plenty of allies pretending to be journalists.

For example, on Wednesday morning, NYU ""journalism"" professor Jay Rosen -- the guy whose name often pops up, despite no talent whatsoever -- demanded that reporters stop asking specific questions about Warren's policies.

Again, a journalism professor telling you not to ask questions. Rosen tweeted: ""The 'make Elizabeth warren say she would raise taxes on the middle class' question should be a credibility killer. For the journalists who keep asking it.""

Now amazingly, Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post agreed with that. She wrote this: ""Journalists are kindly doing President Trump's work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Senator Elizabeth Warren to declare she would raise taxes to fund Medicare-for-All. Of course, it's legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad.""

Did you listen to that? Two journalists telling you, if the answer hurts Democrats, don't ask the question. Don't tell your readers or viewers what the truth is if it increases the chances that Donald Trump could get reelected.

Is that journalism? No, it's pure propaganda. It is the definition of propaganda. Jay Rosen, journalism professor, telling journalists not to ask questions.

Unbelievable.

MARC THIESSEN: ELIZABETH WARREN TELLS VOTERS ECONOMY NOT WORKING FOR THEM - MOST VOTERS DISAGREE



""So, if you can think of it as a big lego thing she would just knock all the pieces down and then she would rebuild it. Who wants to do that? Who wants to take that sort of a risk?

""I hear these politicians, they speak from these old talking points,"" the Fox Business host said. ""Wages are up, but they're not keeping pace with inflation. Yeah, in the last year-and-a-half they have. Or, people are clipping coupons. Not in recent times, right?

""They better freshen up,"" he warned.

In a Washington Post op-ed on Friday, Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen also took on the 2020 front-runner, writing that most voters believe the economy is working for them.

""To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump's policies but don't like Trump,"" Thiessen wrote. ""If Democrats nominated Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy.""

Payne noted: ""[American voters] are enjoying the economic benefits, but if you can speak to people enough you can get them to say, 'I should be doing even better.'

But in a resurfaced tweet from last year, Buttigieg professed support for it.

A Buttigieg aide Wednesday said that he had not changed his position on Medicare for all, explaining that he supports it as an end goal but he wants to take a ""glide path"" to get there, The Hill reported.

“What I'll say is that I've laid out a plan that now explains how we're going to get there, that makes Medicare available to all and at the same time doesn't do away with private plans,"" Buttigieg told a reporter Wednesday who asked if his position had changed.

He added that he doesn’t think private plans need to be gotten rid of to make Medicare available to everyone, according to The Hill.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may soon eclipse former Vice President Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That's great news for Republicans, because Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.

A Marist poll asked voters whether ""the economy is working well for you personally."" Nearly two-thirds of Americans said yes. This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group.

Sixty-seven percent of college graduates and 64 percent of those without a college education say the economy is working for them. So do 68 percent of whites and 61 percent of nonwhite people.

WARREN APPARENTLY GETS THE FACTS WRONG IN ANECDOTE DURING CNN INTERVIEW

So do Americans of every generation: 63 percent of Generation Z and millennials; 69 percent of Generation X; 63 percent of baby boomers; and 69 percent of Greatest Generation and Silent Generation voters.

So do supermajorities in every region in the country: 60 percent in the West, 65 percent in the Northeast, 67 percent in the Midwest, and 68 percent in the South.

So do most voters in every type of American community: 63 percent of both big and small city voters; 64 percent of small-town voters; 66 percent of rural voters and 72 percent of suburban voters.

Most everyone, it seems, says the economy is working for them.

The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59 percent), Democratic women (55 percent) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55 percent.

So, when Warren declares that President Trump is ""part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else,"" it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.

There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them.

Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And The New York Times reported in May that ""over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases.""

Americans don't just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday's debate.

This progress is bad news for Warren. Why would Americans rally to her call for ""big structural change"" to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and – whether she admits it or not – would require them to pay more in taxes?

Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren's proposals, and the numbers are staggering: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for Medicare-for-all; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing.

""Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion,"" Riedl says. And that's before calculating the cost of offering free government health care to illegal immigrants, which Warren supports.

There's no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren's wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.

No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Warren so hard at Tuesday's debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination.

To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump's policies but don't like Trump. They can't do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them, and that they need to make peace with socialism. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity.

If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy.

And since Warren said Tuesday that, if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will ""repeal the filibuster,"" she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump's message – ""whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me"" – will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ latest debate, Joe Biden repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary front-runner alongside the former vice president.

In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ""co-front-runner.""

“I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,” Biden said. “You guys keep talking about that.”

JOE BIDEN'S POTENTIALLY TROUBLING CAMPAIGN CASH REPORT

Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that “Warren has done very well. She’s moved.”

The former vice president was the unrivaled leader of the pack in the 2020 nomination race even before he declared his candidacy in late April. But Warren, gaining stature in a field that once had some two dozen presidential hopefuls, has surged; in many of the most recent national, early-primary-state and caucus-state surveys, she’s virtually tied Biden for the top spot.

Warren’s new status was clearly on display at Tuesday night’s fourth-round nomination debate, when she came under attack from many of her rivals on the stage. Biden, who was the recipient of most of the incoming fire during the first three rounds of debates, was at times absent from the action.

RIVALS TAKE ON WARREN OVER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL, MORE, AT DEBATE

Still, Biden downplayed suggestions that he’s been eclipsed by Warren, saying on the day after the debate that “it's kind of about time other people get questioned.”

But Warren's chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, pointing to the attention Warren received at the debate and to new fundraising reports that potentially hint at some trouble for Biden – tweeted on Wednesday that “it’s rare that we get as much real information in one day to clarify the state of the Democratic primary as we did yesterday.”

Near the top of Tuesday’s debate, two primary rivals -- South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- forcefully took aim at Warren for not directly answering if she’d raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for her push to implement a government-run “Medicare-for-all” health care system.

On that score, Biden had this to say on Wednesday: “It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board. And you know, credibility matters. It matters.”

""She’s going to have to tell the truth, or a question will be raised about whether she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people,” Biden said. “I don’t want to pick on Elizabeth Warren, but this is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.”

Biden, who opposes the Medicare-for-all plan long championed by more progressive rivals like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont instead supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act with a public option.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

“The last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing (President) Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy,""Biden said. “There’s nothing easy about it. If you’re going to do it, tell us how you’re going to do it. It’s called truth in speaking.”

Warren’s campaign told Fox News that the senator is “reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie [Sanders] campaign along with other revenue options.”

Warren further emphasized at the debate that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Beyond health care, Biden criticized Warren for saying during the debate that “I think that we [the United States] ought to get out of the Middle East.”

Warren – who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee – appeared to suggest an end to the decades-old U.S. military presence in the volatile Mideast. Her comments came during a discussion of President Trump’s heavily criticized move to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria.

While Warren has long called for reducing America’s military presence overseas, her campaign said after the debate that the candidate was talking only about combat troops.

“Senator Warren was referencing combat troops, not those stationed in the Middle East in non-combat roles. She believes we need to end the endless wars. That means working to responsibly remove U.S. troops from combat in the Middle East, and using diplomacy to work with allies and partners to end conflicts and suffering in the region,” the campaign said in a statement.

Biden, on Wednesday, said he “frankly was surprised” by Warren’s comments.

The former vice president – who repeatedly touts his foreign policy chops – added that “I had never heard any say, with any serious background on foreign policy, that we pull all troops out of the Middle East. … I’m not sure exactly what she meant by it.”

“If she meant pulling our fleet out of the eastern Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf, I think it would be an absolute disaster for American security and American foreign policy.”

Biden repeated his criticism – without naming Warren – later Wednesday when he delivered a foreign policy address in Iowa.

But remarks Buttigieg made at a previous debate contradicted his hardened stance.

Buttigieg, who has campaigned on ""Medicare-for-all-who-want it,"" called out Warren for being ""evasive"" on whether her health care plan would lead to tax hikes, saying a ""yes or no question"" didn't get a ""yes or no answer.""

""Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,"" Buttigieg told Warren. ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything -- except this.""

""No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in,"" he said.

BUTTIGIEG TWEETED SUPPORT FOR MEDICARE-FOR-ALL IN RESURFACED TWEET DESPITE ATTACKING WARREN AT DEBATE

However, Buttigieg struck a different tone at the previous Democratic debate in July when he was asked ""yes or no"" by CNN moderator Jake Tapper if he was ""willing"" to raise taxes on the middle class to fund universal health care coverage.

""I think you can buy into it, that's the idea of Medicare-for-all-who-want-it,"" Buttigieg responded. “Look, this is a distinction without a difference, whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums.“

He added, ""In this country, if you don't have health care coverage, you're paying too much for care. And if you do have health coverage, you're paying too much for care.""

The Buttigieg campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News for comment.

The 37-year-old candidate also raised eyebrows this week over a resurfaced tweet from February 2018 where he professed his support for Medicare-for-all.

""I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered,"" Buttigieg wrote, responding to whether or not he supported it.

Elizabeth Warren, during an interview after the CNN presidential debate Tuesday night, recalled a man with multiple sclerosis speaking at one of her town halls about his fight for health care -- but video from the event showed she apparently got her facts wrong.

CNN commentator Van Jones pressed Warren on her stance of Medicare-for-all, specifically whether she ""cares"" about people's freedom to opt out of a government-run health care plan.

“What I care about is that they don’t get pushed out,"" Warren responded.

The Massachusetts senator then recalled a town hall attendee she engaged with on the campaign trail.

“I had a young man stand up at a town hall and explain that he had been diagnosed with MS, and his insurance company refused to pay for one of his treatments,” Warren continued. “He had started down the treatment line, and his explanation of it was, there he was, he had insurance, he fights with his insurance company, 'no no no no no,' until he finally ends up in the public system.”

“But understand this, he described it as I have now a lesion in my brain that is an inch long that I will carry for all my life... An insurance company, a man who was fully insured, said ‘You know, we’re just not going to pay for this.'”

ELIZABETH WARREN APPARENTLY SCRUBS DNA-TEST ROLLOUT FROM CAMPAIGN SITE, TWITTER

As Mediaite pointed out, she made multiple errors.

The exchange Warren had with the town hall attendee took place last month in New Hampshire, where a man named Dylan said he was diagnosed with MS and described his situation.

However, as Mediaite's Tommy Christopher explained, Dylan ""was not covered by insurance, which was why his treatment lapsed, and he didn’t end up 'in the public system,' he was denied Medicare because the government deemed him insufficiently disabled.""

Here is what Dylan told Warren:

""I am someone who really relies on my health insurance a lot more than most people, I live with an invisible illness, multiple sclerosis, and I’ve been denied disability basically because, in their words, they don’t think I’m disabled enough.""

""And because of this I basically have to constantly fight to keep my health insurance, and over the summer I was kicked off, not my mistake, but I had to pay for it, and in about 3 months of me trying to get my insurance back, I was delayed from my disease modified therapy, which now resulted in a new centimeter-size lesion that’s going to follow me for life because someone tried to save a few dollars.""

Bernie Sanders I-Vt., seemed to embrace socialism, even as he attempted to distance himself from his rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass., dismissing her as a “capitalist.”

""The seeds of socialism have already been planted and, if we don’t rip [them] out at the roots, we and future generations are gonna wake up to a living nightmare."" — Tomi Lahren, Fox Nation host

""Bernie Sanders dispelled the notion that he and Elizabeth Warren are basically the same person -- even seemingly taking a bit of offense to being compared to Warren,"" Lahren said on Fox Nation's ""Final Thoughts.""

""Not because she lied about being a Native American, not because she may have lied about being fired for being pregnant, but because she is a capitalist,"" she continued.

TOMI LAHREN ISN'T SHOCKED BY 'SQUAD'S ENDORSEMENT

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ""will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

Instead, Sanders is trying to run on a ""Democratic"" brand of socialism, which Lahren called ""a lie and an oxymoron.""

""You can’t have freedom -- economic or otherwise -- under socialism. He and others simply slap that 'democratic' before 'socialism' to make their warped desires of government-controlled everything seem more palatable,"" Lahren said. ""Sad thing is, it’s working -- especially on young Americans.""

SANDERS PROMISES NEW JOBS FOR 'TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' DURING DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

A Gallup poll this year found 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, compared to a 1942 Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing.

""This just goes to show how dangerously close we are to becoming a socialist nation,"" said Lahren, commenting on the poll. ""The seeds of socialism have already been planted and, if we don’t rip those suckers out at the roots, we and future generations are gonna wake up to a living nightmare,"" she warned.

Lahren blamed the ""shocking and downright frightening"" shift on a misrepresentation of socialism and warned of potential ramifications.

""What is happening here?"" she asked. ""Well, leaders like Bernie... Warren, and others are not being honest about what socialism actually entails. They characterize it as a method of rooting out corruption, sticking it to the 'man,' and fighting for the little guy when, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.""

""Socialism breeds corruption,"" she continued. ""There is no bigger 'man' than the 'Almighty Government' and the little guy is the one who is absolutely crushed by socialism.""

Doubling down in her criticism of the Vermont senator and his socialist policies, Lahren warned ""young people of the country"" not to fall for ""free things that will cost them their freedom.""

BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS’ PLAN: ECONOMISTS

""I know free things might sound great to you now,"" she said, ""but here’s the cold, hard truth -- those free things come at a cost of your freedom. Don’t like being told what to do? Wait till you live under socialism. It won’t be pretty. You can be free or you can be dependent on the government -- but you can't be both. Choose wisely,"" she said.

""This next election and, even more importantly, the one after that, will determine the future of this nation,"" Lahren concluded. ""Don’t take it lightly.""

""It appears there is some roiling tension inside that Democratic field. People are not satisfied with the field they have,"" he said on ""The Ben Shapiro Show.""

""Honestly, if Hillary Clinton were to make her grand reentrance, now would be about the time she should do it. Because the fact is, a lot of people are dissatisfied with [Joe] Biden. A lot of people are dissatisfied with [Elizabeth] Warren and Hillary is an enormous name.""

Shapiro predicted that if Clinton got into the race she would easily clinch the nomination, but said she is unlikely to do so, paving the way for a Trump victory next November.

CLINTON CALLS FOR CAUTION ON IMPEACHMENT, TELLS DEMOCRATS NOT TO 'JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS'

""If she were to jump in right now, I think there's a pretty good shot she wins the nomination,"" he said. ""Now, is she actually going to do that? Probably not. And that means the Democratic field is pretty, extraordinarily weak.""

The Daily Wire editor-in-chief also targeted Warren directly and mocked her front-runner status, by calling her a dishonest liar.

Amy Klobuchar – giddy after a lack of sleep and rave reviews for her debate performance – touted to the jam-packed crowd inside a café in New Hampshire’s capital city that she raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours after Tuesday’s Democratic presidential nomination showdown.

The haul was nearly a quarter of what she brought in during the entire July-September third quarter of fundraising.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR MEDICARE-FOR-ALL

Highlighting that most of the money was from small-dollar contributions, the Minnesota Democrat told reporters “that shows something happened, that people were watching and they responded. And that is a very big deal for us.”

As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate.

His campaign touted that Wednesday was “one of our biggest fundraising days yet.” And Buttigieg communications director Lis Smith showcased that the campaign “saw more traffic to their website in the past 24 hours than any other day.”

At the debate, both Buttigieg and Klobuchar took aim at co-front runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts over how she’d pay for her proposed government-run Medicare-for-all plan.

The aggressive moves throughout the debate by both Buttigieg and Klobuchar literally paid off. And the potential surge for the two candidates trying to appeal to more centrist voters in the party could spell trouble for another more establishment contender: former Vice President Joe Biden.

AMID BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN CASH WOES, TOP ADVISERS VOW THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

Biden was the unrivaled front-runner in the race from even before he declared his candidacy in late April. But Warren caught up with him this autumn in many of the most recent national and early voting state polls. And Biden’s been eclipsed by Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Buttigieg when it comes to the crucial fundraising race.

According to his Federal Election Commission filing, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised the past three months. That’s far less than Sanders, Warren, and even Buttigieg.

“This week's debate was the best yet for Mayor Pete and Sen. Klobuchar and came at a moment of prime opportunity for them,” noted Ben LaBolt, a Democratic strategist who served as a spokesman on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign and national press secretary on the president’s 2012 re-election campaign.

LaBolt spotlighted that “Biden's vote share is more gettable for pragmatic candidates like Buttigieg and Klobuchar than it is for Warren. The challenge now is to present a vision that shows what they could achieve in office versus a more systemically disruptive vision from Sen. Warren. The clock is ticking in Iowa and New Hampshire for that message to reach the remaining persuadable voters.”

Klobuchar, on frenetic post-debate swing through all 10 counties in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, appears to get it.

She called her performance in this week’s debate “critical.” And with just three and a half months to go until the primaries and caucuses kick off, she emphasized “this is when the campaign season begins.”"

One day after reports emerged that the group of far-left House Democrats planned to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential race, it seemed only one of them – Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – was officially aboard the Bernie Bus:

As for the others:

-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had made no official endorsement but was still rumored to be attending a Sanders rally scheduled for this weekend in Queens, N.Y. – one of two New York city boroughs that include a portion of Ocasio-Cortez’s home district.

BIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

-- Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., clarified Wednesday that she had not yet endorsed a 2020 presidential candidate – even though CNN and Omar claimed Tlaib had backed Sanders.

-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., also hadn’t made an endorsement.

Pressley’s camp stressed that while the Squad members support one another in Congress, they don’t necessarily speak with one voice on all issues.

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service,” a Pressley spokesperson told Vox. “Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.”

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.” — Spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.

One factor possibly stalling a Pressley endorsement of Sanders: She hails from the same state as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, so she might not be as eager to oppose a presidential candidate from her home area – the way that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for example, backed former Vice President Joe Biden instead of her fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris.

According to Boston.com, Pressley’s ties to the Sanders campaign aren’t as strong as those of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, with Pressley having backed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. In addition, Pressley has worked with Warren on legislation in Congress and also has close relationships with Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who have been seeking her endorsement, the report said.

Tlaib, meanwhile, hasn’t ruled out a Sanders endorsement down the road, telling the Detroit Free Press she will host the U.S. senator from Vermont in her district later this month – just as she recently did recently with Warren. (Warren posted video from that visit online Wednesday -- and Tlaib retweeted it.)

""I am looking forward to bringing Senator Sanders to Michigan on Oct. 27 for a tour of our district that will highlight economic justice issues and corporate tax giveaways, and (include) a roundtable with housing justice advocates,” Tlaib said. “I need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen. Sanders about these critically important issues.”

But regardless of what Tlaib and Pressley ultimately decide to do, the Sanders endorsement by Omar – and rumored endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez – were blows to the Warren campaign, coming on the same night that the senator fended off fierce attacks from fellow Democrats at the party’s presidential debate in Ohio.

As Boston.com noted, Warren has courted Ocasio-Cortez, having lunch with her in March, writing a blurb for Ocasio-Cortez’s entry in Time magazine’s “Time 100” listing, and filming a video with Ocasio-Cortez in which the pair reviewed the final episode of “Game of Thrones.”"

""By the end of the evening it was obvious that the Democrats will say and do at this point almost anything, including contort their own views on key issues just to oppose Trump,"" Ingraham said, referencing the debate Tuesday night.

It's to maintain power and influence in the Democratic party that increasingly looks to AOC and the Squad for leadership.""

However, they have a big problem: the excellent ideas are stolen from President Trump, the man they love to hate.

The Democrats would never admit they’re advocating for some parts of Trump’s successful Make America Great Again agenda. But since they’re doing it, voters have to ask: why settle for a cheap knockoff of the Trump presidency when they can reelect Trump in November 2020 and get the genuine article for four more years?

The Democratic plagiarism of Trump's ideas was on full display when 12 presidential wannabees competed for attention Tuesday night on a very crowded debate stage in Ohio.

CHARLES PAYNE: ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS TO BREAK APART AN ECONOMY THAT'S WORKING

Buried amid their grandiose claims, impeachment frenzy, and grandstanding on far-left policies were some good ideas that helped Donald Trump become President Trump.

Much of the first hour of the debate was spent on Democratic demonization of Trump and their endorsement of his impeachment to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election.

hen the Democratic candidates circled the wagons to defend one of those on stage – former Vice President Joe Biden – whose son Hunter was paid about $50,000 a month to serve on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company. Hunter had no special knowledge of Ukraine or the energy industry and had only one qualification for the high-paid position – his dad was serving as vice president and played a key role in the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy.

Later, each of the candidates spent time on his or her individual far-left radical fantasies. All endorsed various pie-in-the-sky hugely expensive health plans to increase the government’s role in health insurance and health care.

Former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke of Texas outlined his vision of nationwide gun confiscation – ignoring the Second Amendment of the Constitution that gives Americans the right to keep and bear arms.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang touted his plan to give $1,000 a month to every adult in the country – vote-buying on a grand scale that would have to be funded by raising our taxes to come up with the “free” money to give back to us.

Some of the biggest applause, however, came when the Democratic candidates delivered the exact same lines presidential candidate Donald Trump used in 2016. For instance, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts correctly pointed out that the “principal reason” for American job losses in recent decades “has been bad trade policy.”

“The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who’ve been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty … to American workers,” the Massachusetts extreme leftist declared.

Warren presented the argument as though she were the first one to think of it, adopting the posture of someone who was bravely breaking a taboo and challenging established orthodoxy. But Warren’s “eureka” moment came about four years late.

Soulless free-trade fundamentalism, international agreements that favored multinational corporations over American workers, and subservience to China’s economic bullying were the orthodoxy – under Warren’s own Democratic Party.

President Bill Clinton gave us the disastrous North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It was President Barack Obama who nearly got us locked into the even worse Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It was twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who promised Wall Street bankers that they could count on her to deliver “open trade and open borders.”

Where was Warren when Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign in 2015? He stated repeatedly in his announcement speech that American job losses were the result of our feckless negotiators letting China and other countries “kill us” on trade.

Was Warren not listening during the 2016 campaign, when Trump said that “we’re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pursued by powerful corporations” in order to achieve a trade policy that benefits American workers?

Has Warren – now a top-tier presidential candidate – not paid attention as President Trump has delivered on his campaign promises throughout his presidency?

For the record, Trump pulled us out of TPP, replaced NAFTA with an agreement that gives American workers a fair shake, imposed strategic counter-tariffs to pressure China into ending its rampant trade abuses, and created millions of new American jobs in the process.

Warren is an intelligent and politically astute woman. She knows her trade rhetoric is a carbon-copy of what Trump has been saying for over four years. But she’s just betting that her Democratic base isn’t paying attention to the world beyond its far-left bubble. After all, much of her career has been based on hoping people weren’t paying attention to the details about her background, her work history and other aspects of her life.

Even the liberal Vox website could see what was happening, observing that “Warren’s rhetoric here would hardly be out of place in a Trump speech.”

O’Rourke was even more shameless than Warren. He told the debate audience that in order to secure a level playing field for American workers we need to make sure “that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions.” The lack of Mexican labor protections, he lectured, “puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage.”

Yes, Beto, we know. That’s why President Trump criticized NAFTA vociferously throughout the 2016 campaign. It’s also why his negotiators successfully crafted the new U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement (USMCA) that will, for the first time, require that Mexican goods sold in America to be made by workers who enjoy many of the same labor protections we have in America. This will make sure that cheap and exploited foreign labor don’t undercut American workers.

O’Rourke should tell his former Democratic colleagues in the U.S. House to approve USMCA so it can take effect. Unfortunately, they’re stalling on approval because they don’t want to give Trump an accomplishment that will help him win reelection – despite the many benefits the agreement would bring to the American people.

Like O’Rourke, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is more interested in trying to damage President Trump politically with an absurd and baseless impeachment inquiry than working to help American workers.

Desperate Democrats are engaged in a hopeless task – convincing voters that the Trump presidency has been a disaster. But they are all-too eager to claim they will do some of the things Trump said he would do to improve the lives of the American people.

And while the Democrats can only make campaign promises, Trump can show he has kept his promises and has fulfilled his pledge to Make America Great Again.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim Thursday at presidential nomination rival Joe Biden, accusing the former vice president of using insurance industry “talking points” to criticize Sanders' plan to implement a government-run “Medicare-for-all” system.

“It is really sad that Joe Biden is using the talking points of the insurance industry to attack Medicare for All,” Sanders claimed in an email to supporters.

“Joe must know that we currently spend twice as much per capita on health care as the people of almost any other major country and that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” added the independent senator who’s making his second straight White House bid.

POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE

Biden has opposed the “Medicare-for-all” plan championed by Sanders and supported by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – a co-front-runner with Biden right now in the Democrats' primary race. The Senate bill – which Sanders authored – would eliminate private insurance. Biden, instead, has been pushing for a public option to strengthen and supplement the national health-care law better known as ObamaCare.

At Tuesday’s fourth-round presidential primary debate, Biden once again criticized “Medicare-for-all,” taking aim at its price tag.

“The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget,” he emphasized.

He also argued that the costs would be passed on to average Americans.

“If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000,” Biden noted. “That is more than they will possibly save on this health-care plan.”

BIDEN TAKES AIM AT SANDERS AND WARREN OVER 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

Responding, Sanders indirectly accused Biden of failing to stand up to the health-care industry.

“I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health-care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” he stressed.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR, SLAM WARREN OVER 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

“If we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves,” Sanders added.

Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Ohio, Biden returned fire, saying, “Bernie doesn’t pay for half his plan.”

And, taking aim at both Sanders and Warren – who unlike Sanders has refused to acknowledge that middle-class taxes would rise to pay for “Medicare-for-all” – Biden said, “look, the last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing (President) Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy. There’s nothing easy about it.”

The intra-party battle over implementing “Medicare-for-all” versus strengthening the nation’s health-care law – known as the Affordable Care Act – has been a leading and divisive issue in the race for the presidential nomination."

“I think the Biden campaign needs to be concerned,” the former interim DNC chairwoman told “America’s Newsroom.”

Biden was overshadowed by fellow co-front-runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the fourth-round Democratic presidential nomination debate, but the former vice president has a potentially larger headache – a lack of campaign cash.

AMID BIDEN’S CASH WOES, CAMPAIGN VOWS IT HAS THE MONEY ‘TO RUN OUR RACE’

As Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.

According to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.

BIDEN'S THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING HAUL A WARNING SIGN

Ceraso, who worked on Sanders’ 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or “his cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.”

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised left him, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

“Get the burn rate down,” Brazile said, calling on Democratic voters to ""step up"" to counter the RNC, which raised a record $27.3 million last month.

“Get rid of any of those top-level consultants and put the money where it needs to be - that’s in the first four early states. There’s still time but they need to be concerned about the burn rate.""

The tax credit would apply to companies in ""designated rural zones"" defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is capped at $250,000 a year. To be eligible, businesses must hire three or more new full-time workers, one of whom must live in the community.

When I am president, rural America will have a partner ready and willing to listen and work together on real solutions to the problems they face every day.”

Harris’ rural plan comes with a more than $100 billion price tag and will be paid for through a broad increase in corporate taxes.

In addition to the tax credit, her proposal says she will use executive action to eliminate “Trump’s tariffs,” expand rural health care and guarantee broadband access to all households by 2024.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded to calls for social media companies to curtail President Trump's activities on platforms such as Twitter.

""My belief is that in a democracy, I don’t think that we want private companies censoring politicians in the news,"" Zuckerberg told Dana Perino in an exclusive interview airing Friday on ""The Daily Briefing.""

KAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT AMID WHISTLEBLOWER TWEETS

During the interview, Perino asked Zuckerberg about Sen. Kamala Harris' demand that Twitter shut down Trump's account, which the president uses regularly to share his views on a multitude of issues.

Zuckerberg said Silicon Valley shouldn't be taking such actions.

""I generally believe that as a principle, people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe, who they want to vote for,"" he said. ""And I don’t think that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of company doing.""

Earlier this month, Harris, D-Calif., claimed Trump was using Twitter to inappropriately criticize an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

""The President's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told CNN.

FACEBOOK CEO SAYS HE WON'T FURTHER ANTAGONIZE ELIZABETH WARREN AFTER THREATENING LAWSUIT

""Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting ... directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be -- his Twitter account should be suspended.”

In the interview with Perino, Zuckerberg also responded to another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's criticism of Facebook.

Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign account tweeted it had created a ""Facebook ad with false claims"" and submitted it to the social media site's platform, which approved it.

In that same series of tweets, Warren's team claimed Facebook had ""changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies — explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine.""

In a recent live-streamed company meeting, Zuckerberg said that he would ""try not to antagonize her [Warren] further.""

""Even when people disagree with what I think would be good to happen in the world, I still want to give them a voice — that's what we're here to do,"" Zuckerberg told his employees.

The 35-year-old billionaire told Perino it is important for Americans to ""think for themselves"" about what politicians say.

""Political speech is one of the most scrutinized [forms of] speech that is out there, so that’s already happening,"" he added. ""Our position on this is not an outlier.""

""[We] as a company have the greatest responsibility here to make sure that we proactively make sure that there isn't harm or danger happening on our platform,"" he told Perino.

""But, at the end of the day, I don't think that people want any given private company to be making so many important decisions about speech or elections or the democratic process,"" Zuckerberg said. ""I certainly think that even we make too many important decisions about speech.""

""So, the question is, what's the answer?"" he asked.

There are many issues and questions around protecting elections and what type of political discourse should be allowed on the platform, in addition to privacy concerns, Zuckerberg said.

""But right now, what I think is happening is [...] people aren't seeing enough progress on some of that regulation,"" he said.

""I think, in some of these cases, having some more democratic processes, some clearer rules for the Internet or some new institutions -- which we're trying to create with this independent oversight board that we're standing up ourselves. So people in our community can appeal content decisions that we make,"" Zuckerberg said.

""I think that there are real issues there,"" he added.

Zuckerberg told Perino that Facebook ""made a lot of progress"" in terms of protecting the integrity of elections and the ""challenges that were there a few years ago.""

""I think you can look at the results of elections around the world and see that our systems are now a lot better, and we can be a lot more continuity,"" he added.

The network landed an average of 8.3 million views during the three-hour telecast. That marked quite a dip from its previous two-part debates in July, where viewership peaked at 10.7 million. CNN's debate also saw an almost 50-percent drop from the first debate hosted by NBC News back in June, which received 15.3 million viewers.

In addition, 449,000 viewers watched live streams on various platforms from CNN and The New York Times, who co-hosted the debate.

The fourth debate featured 12 candidates on one stage. They were: former Vice President Joe Biden,; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

CNN DEBATE SLAMMED BY CRITICS, CANDIDATES: 'DAMAGED THE NETWORK'S CREDIBILITY EVEN FURTHER'

CNN and The Times faced an avalanche of criticism during and after the debate. The hosting news outlets received backlash for not asking the 12 candidates about topics including China, which has made big headlines in recent weeks amid the ongoing trade war with the U.S.; the mounting tensions in Hong Kong; and the growing controversy with the NBA.

Even the candidates slammed the debate hosts. Castro blasted the debate for not asking any questions about climate change but making time for a question about Ellen DeGeneres' friendship with former President George W. Bush. Harris similarly called out the news organizations for overlooking climate change, immigration and LGBT issues.

Gabbard, however, may have had the fiercest attack, which she made on the debate stage.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" she said, apparently gesturing toward the moderators. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

On the Democratic primary ballot, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., released a plan in June that calls for all student debt to be eliminated regardless of family income level, and that students from families with incomes of $25,000 or less would have their college costs covered.

The plan would be paid for with a tax on stock trades, bonds, derivatives and other types of investments. The Vermont lawmaker called the plan ""a revolutionary proposal.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she plans to cancel $50,000 in student debt for each person with household incomes under $100,000.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR GET BIG POST-DEBATE BOOST

Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar – giddy after a lack of sleep and rave reviews for her debate performance – touted to the jam-packed crowd inside a café in New Hampshire’s capital city that she raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours after Tuesday’s Democratic presidential nomination showdown. The haul was nearly a quarter of what she brought in during the entire July-September third quarter of fundraising. Highlighting that most of the money was from small-dollar contributions, the Minnesota Democrat told reporters ‘that shows something happened, that people were watching and they responded. And that is a very big deal for us.’ As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate. His campaign touted that Wednesday was ‘one of our biggest fundraising days yet.’”



Buttigieg draws heat from black activists over fundraiser - AP: “Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to attend a Chicago fundraiser that will be co-hosted by a former city attorney who vigorously tried to block the release of a video depicting the shooting of Laquan McDonald , a black teenager whose death at the hands of police stirred months of protest and resulted in an officer’s conviction. Steve Patton, who led Chicago’s law department under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, is listed as a sponsor of the Friday event, according to an invitation obtained by The Associated Press. For months, Buttigieg has faced criticism over his own handling of race as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a racially divided city where decades of simmering racial tension erupted this summer when a white police officer shot and killed an African American man. … ‘He should adjust his schedule,’ said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, when asked about the fundraiser.”



Analysis finds Warren $30 trillion short on single-payer plan - Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren took a lot of flak at this week’s Democratic presidential debate for being evasive about the taxes needed to pay for the $30 trillion Medicare for All plan she champions. There’s a reason for being vague: Her team hasn’t yet figured out how to pay for it. ‘Her taxes as they currently exist are not enough yet to cover fully replacing health insurance,’ University of California, Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who advised the Warren campaign… Warren -- who campaigns on the theme that she has a plan for everything -- is relying on the wealthy and big corporations to pay for her vision of restructuring American society, including funding student debt, free college, universal childcare, green energy and affordable housing plans. … But she has made the strategic decision to adopt Bernie Sanders’ government-run health care plan rather than develop one of her own. … The Warren campaign said they are continuing to review revenue options to fund Medicare for All…”



Tim Alberta: Watching the Dem debate with Michael Bennet - Politico: “The instincts that guide [Michael] Bennet—being pragmatic, deliberative, restrained—are what many Americans say are precisely what’s needed to run the White House. But now, perhaps more than ever, those instincts are the opposite of what’s needed to win the White House. Once upon a time, there was a limited return on investing in outrage and demagoguery; statesmen were in high demand no matter the supply. That’s no longer the case, and not simply because a celebrity showman named Donald Trump is president of the United States. The painful reality of this political moment slides over Bennet like a barbed-wire blanket as he flops onto the couch and kicks off his faded brown dress shoes, preparing for a three-hour reality-television show that will help determine who leads the free world. All the more irksome to Bennet is the fact that five of his fellow senators are staring back at him from beneath the bright lights; he is the only member of the ‘world’s greatest deliberative body’ seeking a promotion who is excluded from the festivities.”



David Brooks: If it’s Trump vs. Warren, then what? - WaPo: “This is a memo for the politically homeless. It’s a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It’s a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do? The first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B’s or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar. These candidates are pluralists, not purists. … And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. … Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed.”

TIME OUT: LE EWW, LE GROSS

AFP: “The Paris zoo's latest attraction is a brainless, eyeless, single-celled organism with no limbs or stomach but more than 700 genders. Meet the ‘blob’, also known by its scientific name Physarum polycephalum or ‘many-headed slime.’ Preceding humans on Earth by some 500 million years, the creature resembles a kind of slippery sponge. It appears stationary, but does cover ground – at a leisurely pace of up to [0.4 inches] per hour – in search of prey, such as mushroom spores, bacteria, and other microbes. From Saturday, members of the public can become better acquainted with ‘le blob’, which has taken up residence in a large tank at the zoo in Paris' Bois de Vincennes park. Named after the 1958 sci-fi horror movie ‘The Blob’ about an alien creature that crashes to Earth and devours residents of Pennsylvania, the real-life blob consists of a single cell, sometimes with many nuclei that can replicate their DNA and divide.”

MULVANEY INCREASES WHITE HOUSE MISERY INDEX

WaPo: “For 39 minutes Thursday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney turned the press briefing room into a sort of confession chamber, openly admitting to several acts that could deepen the legal predicament for the president. [Donald] Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he has abused his office for personal and political gain. … In admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet — and potentially illegal — part out loud. But that strategy with regard to Ukraine came in for withering criticism after Mulvaney’s appearance, and he later tried to walk back his comments. In a statement late Thursday, Mulvaney denied the quid pro quo he had previously defended as appropriate and normal.”



State Department official: Obama administration ignored Biden warnings - Fox News: “A State Department official focused on Ukraine policy told Congress this week he raised concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm in 2015, but was rebuffed by former Vice President Joe Biden’s staff, Fox News has confirmed. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who testified behind closed doors before committees spearheading the formal House impeachment inquiry, told congressional investigators that he had qualms about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. … A congressional source confirmed to Fox News on Friday that Kent testified that when he brought his concerns to the office of the vice president in 2016, his staff ‘blew him off’ and ignored the issue involving the younger Biden's role at the firm.”



Support steady for impeachment probe - Pew Research Center: “The new survey by Pew Research Center … finds that 54% currently approve of the House’s decision to conduct an impeachment inquiry, while 44% disapprove. Neither party engenders a great deal of confidence that they will be ‘fair and reasonable’ during the impeachment inquiry, the survey finds. About four-in-ten (43%) expect that the Republicans in Congress will be fair in handling the inquiry, while slightly more (47%) say the same about the Democrats in Congress. The survey, conducted on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, enables us to examine opinions about impeachment among the same group of respondents over the past month.”



Rick Perry announces year-end departure amid increasing scrutiny - NPR: “Secretary of Energy Rick Perry plans to leave his position at the end of the year, President Trump confirmed to reporters Thursday in Fort Worth, Texas. Trump praised Perry and said he already has a replacement in mind. ‘Rick has done a fantastic job,’ Trump said. ‘But it was time.’ Trump said that Perry's resignation didn't come as a surprise and that he has considered leaving for six months because ‘he's got some very big plans.’ Perry, 69, is one of Trump's original Cabinet members and recently has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry of Trump. Perry was part of what was dubbed ‘the three amigos’ — in addition to Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, former envoy to Ukraine — charged with managing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship after the White House removed the core of its Ukraine policy team last spring.”



DEMS BUILD CASH CASTELLATION AROUND HOUSE MAJORITY

Politico: “Democrats are building a financial bulwark around their House majority that’s going to be tough for Republicans to breach in 2020. Thirty-three of the 44 most vulnerable House Democrats have stashed an impressive $1 million or more in the bank well before the election year even begins. And their fundraising pace is not slowing down as they gear up to defend the chamber. Federal Election Commission reports filed this week illustrate Democrats’ formidable advantage: The 44 Democrats in the most competitive seats banked a collective $59 million so far. Nearly 30 raised $500,000 or more in the third quarter, according to a POLITICO analysis of the fundraising filings. And all but six of the so-called ‘frontliners’ have at least half a million more banked than their challengers, if they have any challenger at all. … The GOP is struggling to adapt to a changing landscape; They can no longer dismiss the strong fundraising as an anomaly when it has remained steady throughout the first three quarters of 2019.”



Can anyone beat AOC? - NYT: “It is hard to imagine a scenario where Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loses her seat next year. She has raised more than $3.4 million, is better known than some presidential candidates and handily won a district that is among the bluest in the nation. But that hasn’t stopped people — lots of them — from trying to unseat her. So far, eight Republicans and three Democrats have filed to run for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s seat in the Bronx and Queens. Two of the Republicans have each raised more than $420,000, even though no Republican has represented the Bronx in Congress in at least 50 years. … The campaigns also highlight a broader strategy by the Republican Party: turning voters’ resentment toward Ms. Ocasio-Cortez into a conduit for the party’s other electoral goals.”



POLL SHOWS GARDNER TRAILING HICKENLOOPER

KMGH: “New Colorado polling released Thursday shows that John Hickenlooper leads Sen. Cory Gardner in a theoretical Senate matchup next year by 11 percentage points and that a majority of Coloradans support the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The Keating Research-OnSight Public Affairs-Martin Campaigns (KOM) survey released Thursday afternoon was conducted by the Democratic pollsters Oct. 10-14 and polled 500 active statewide voters who cast ballots in 2016, 2017 or 2018 or signed up to vote since last November. The poll was weighted to be in line with voter turnout demographics and the margin of error was ±4.4% and was paid for by KOM.”



Former Republican launches Kansas Senate bid as a Democrat - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas lawmaker who left the Republican Party last year now hopes to become the first Kansas Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in decades. State Sen. Barbara Bollier launched her campaign for U.S. Senate on Wednesday by promising an independent approach. She condemned dysfunction in Washington as she seeks to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. … Bollier, of Mission Hills in Johnson County, is the fourth Democrat in the race and the ninth candidate overall – joining a sprawling field that includes Republicans Rep. Roger Marshall and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. In the Democratic contest, she will have to overcome serious campaigns by former federal prosecutor Barry Grissom and Manhattan Mayor Pro Tem Usha Reddi.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A small, but important correction. It is not the American Air Force at work in Syria. It is either the American air force or it is the United States Air Force/U.S. Air Force, from which I am retired with 21 years of service. The same goes for the American army or the American navy. I agree with capitalizing proper names, but prefer that it be done properly. I'm a faithful reader, an independent politically, and I appreciate your non-partisan approach. Sometimes it feels as though we who prefer listening, thinking and discussing rationally are but drowning voices in a maelstrom of partisan fury. The Halftime Report is one of the very few media outlets that I feel I can trust to report accurately and to make projections which are supported reasonably. Thank you for the time and effort you and your team put into keeping us informed.” – Dave Riley, Kasilof, Alaska



[Ed. note: Good point, Mr. Riley! Certainly no disrespect intended. I was swerving from overuse of U.S. and ran off the other side of the road. Thank you so much for your kind words, readership and, most of all, your service.]



“Chris, I hope the new Syrian ceasefire lasts longer than your pledge to remain neutral about Trump in your Halftime Report.” – Scott Lyddon, Savannah, Ga.



[Ed. note: I’ve got to give it to you, Mr. Lyddon. That was pretty good! And since the cease fire seems to have ended before it really began, you may be now doubly right from your own perspective. I would remind you though that the goal here isn’t to be “neutral,” but rather to be useful. Fair analysis will necessarily include criticism. If there were no criticism – true neutrality – we would lose the capacity to render necessary judgments. My promise to you, however, is that I do not and will not make judgement about ideological rights and wrongs. As we wrote Thursday, we hold harmless those who either support or oppose the president’s policies in Syria. The same goes for the competing opinions about whether the president should be removed from office for leaning on the Ukrainians to investigate his political foes. Both positions are defensible and substantially irrelevant to my work. Our point Thursday was that however you feel about the policies, Trump’s chaotic governance and indiscipline is creating political liabilities. This week has been a brutal one for the administration, most of it needlessly so. I hope, whatever resentments you may hold for my rejection of neutrality, you still find the analysis useful.]



“As much as I admire moderation in the body politic, it seems that we are rapidly approaching a choice for those of us with (R) on our voting status. I find much of the President's language and combative behavior appalling, however he is generally consistent with my views on policy. But I am APPALLED by the full throated embrace of Socialism that is occurring on the other ‘side of the aisle.’ If we ‘moderate conservatives’ sit this one out (as probably occurred with the evangelical Christians in 2012), I believe the result could be an upheaval of our American way of life, facilitated by the most massive transfer of wealth in history.” – Patsy Fields, Aliso Viejo, Calif.



[Ed. note: Well, I’ve got good news and bad news for you, Ms. Fields. The bad news is that we are indeed already in the midst of an upheaval of American life. The changes we’re seeing in how we live, work, play, worship, mate, learn and communicate are massive in scope. You would have to go back a century or more to find a moment that even comes close to the enormous societal and, consequently, political change that has wracked American society over the past 20 years. No matter how you vote, that toothpaste isn’t going back in the tube. Neither party nor any politician has the answer for dealing with all of these changes. The far left believes economic collectivism based on an ambition for social justice is the answer, while the far right champions a sort of cultural collectivism supported by economic nationalism in which the government works to engineer a new American culture to its supporters liking. Both will probably fail to achieve their highest aims. And that’s the good news. As we have done many times before, the rest of us will just have to figure it out, making it up as we go. It’s going to be bumpy, but I remain confident that it’s going to be great.]

OH, FLOYD

NY Daily News: “A leisurely Sunday afternoon hike on a mountain trail outside of Salt Lake City turned into an animal rescue after Floyd, a 3-year-old, 190-pound Mastiff, decided he was too tired to descend and wouldn’t budge. Around 6:30 p.m. as temperatures were dropping, rescuers were called after other hikers stumbled upon Floyd and his owner. Luckily, the all-volunteer Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office search and rescue team was able strap Floyd into a stretcher and carry the big fella down to the trailhead without further incident. ‘They had no hesitation whatsoever, even when they heard it was a dog,’ Sgt. Melody Gray of the Unified Police Department, which works with the sheriff’s search and rescue team, told CNN. She added the whole operation lasted about four hours.”

“What’s so remarkable is that constitutions are highly reactionary documents. The very essence of a constitution is to constrain the enthusiasms of a future that one cannot even see.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) in a column from Krauthammer’s posthumous book, “The Point of It All,” published in the Washington Post on Nov. 29, 2018.

Here's what you need to know as you start your Thursday ...

BREAKING NEWS: U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. and House Oversight Committee chairman, died early Thursday at age 68, according to his office. Cummings' office released a statement, saying, ""At approximately 2:45 a.m. on Thursday Oct. 17, 2019, Congressman Elijah E. Cummings (MD-07) passed away at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications concerning longstanding health challenges."" Stay with Fox News for further developments

Pelosi, Trump accuse each other of 'meltdown' after Dems storm out of Syria meeting

One thing is clear after top Democrats stormed out of a White House meeting with President Trump on Wednesday: The tension between the president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has reached a boiling point -- and now observers wonder if they’ll ever be able to work together.

Afterward, Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer held an impromptu news conference outside the White House, telling reporters they walked out of the meeting on Syria policy after Trump allegedly called Pelosi either a ""third-rate politician"" or ""third-grade politician"" and angrily suggested the Democrats probably appreciated communist Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East.

""What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., said. She added later, at the Capitol: ""I pray for the president all the time, and I tell him that -- I pray for his safety and that of his family. Now, we have to pray for his health -- because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.""

A senior Democratic aide told Fox News that Trump began the meeting by remarking that ""someone wanted this meeting so I agreed to it."" Trump also reportedly told Pelosi, ""I hate ISIS more than you do,"" prompting Pelosi to respond, ""You don't know that."" The meeting devolved after that point, according to several sources. As the Democrats walked out, Trump reportedly remarked, ""I'll see you at the polls.""

Trump, for his part, tweeted photos from the meeting, including one showing Pelosi standing across the table from him and pointing her finger at the president. Trump captioned the photo, ""Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!"" (Pelosi later used that photo on her official Twitter account.) Click here for more on this story.

Trump tells Turkey’s Erdogan, ‘Don’t be a tough guy,’ ahead of visit from Pence, Pompeo: Before the dramatic developments at the White House, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday he will speak to Vice President Mike Pence and a U.S. delegation heading to Ankara over a potential ceasefire deal in Syria after apparently snubbing the group earlier in the morning. Pence, heading a U.S. contingent that includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien, was set to arrive in Turkey on Thursday. House lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan resolution opposing Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria. Fox Business' Trish Regan exclusively obtained a letter from Trump to Erdogan, urging him, “Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool,” and ""work out a good deal!""

Biden ramps up attacks on Warren, dismisses her as a fellow front-runner

One day after arguably being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ debate in Ohio, Joe Biden downplayed her recent gains in the polls and repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of her as a ""co-front-runner."" “I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,” Biden said. “You guys keep talking about that.”

Biden's new attacks on Warren come as it appears every member of the ""Squad"" may not be ""all in"" on endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., just yet.

Rick Perry contacted Giuliani at Trump's direction on concerns about Ukraine corruption: Wall Street Journal

Energy Secretary Rick Perry, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said President Trump directed him to seek out his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani this spring to address the president's concerns about alleged Ukrainian corruption. The Journal reported that Perry ""said he contacted Mr. Giuliani in an effort to ease a path to a meeting between Mr. Trump and his new Ukrainian counterpart"" and that there were concerns about Ukraine's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Perry told the Journal he never heard Trump or Giuliani discuss the possibility of investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Chicago teachers expected to strike after rejecting contract offer

The Chicago Teacher’s Union rejected a final contract offer from Chicago Public Schools on Wednesday, making it likely that more than 25,000 teachers and support personnel will strike beginning Thursday. Nearly 400,000 students and families stand to be affected. Classes were preemptively canceled Thursday due to the prospect of a job action, though school buildings were scheduled to remain open and meals will be served.

Megyn Kelly calls on NBC to have 'outside investigator' probe shocking sex allegations

In her first televised interview since leaving NBC News last year, Megyn Kelly told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson that the Peacock Network needs an ""outside investigator"" to probe the shocking sexual misconduct allegations made by some former NBC employees. ""There needs to be an outside investigation into this company,” Kelly told Carlson. “They investigated themselves. That doesn't work.”

In his new book, ""Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,"" Pulitzer-winning journalist Ronan Farrow details the resistance he says he faced from his former bosses at NBC News while reporting on disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein. The book exposes several allegations against former “Today” anchor Matt Lauer. Farrow contends top executives knew about the accusations longer than they claimed and were intent on quashing allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein and simultaneously keeping a lid on claims against Lauer.

Beto O'Rourke, one of the Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020, urged Republicans in Congress to envoke a clause of the Constitution that potentially would block President Trump from hosting the G-7 summit at a Trump resort in Doral, Fla.

The White House announced the venue of the summit, scheduled to take place between June 10 and 12, at a news conference on Thursday, which incited controversy immediately, raising questions about the optics and ethics of the president personally profiting off an official government event.

Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney attempted to quell outcry by telling the media that Trump will not make any money off the event, adding that the Trump National Doral Golf Club will be providing the location and services at a cost.

""The Constitution clearly bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign powers,"" O'Rourke tweeted. ""Congress must use its authority to enforce the Emoluments Clause now to stop President Trump from profiting off of the G-7 Summit by hosting it at his own property.""

""The question isn't whether President Trump has violated the emoluments clause-- or committed other high crimes. The question is whether Republicans in Congress believe our president is above the law,"" he also wrote.

The emoluments clause was intended to prevent foreign states from influencing the U.S. government and generally prohibits presidents from taking any forms of payment from other nations.

Trump has argued that the clause referred to a ban on outright bribes, not business transactions, and that he will continue to do business with foreign governments at his hotels.

Trump repeatedly has faced allegations of enriching himself by utilizing his business entities around the globe to house or host foreign dignitaries and domestic politicians.

Another presidential candidate, Julián Castro, a former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama, also slammed Trump over his decision to hold the summit at one of his properties, which was one of 12 potential sites being considered for the event, according to Mulvaney.

""It's a terrible decision by President Trump to put the G-7 on a gulf course at his own hotel,"" Castro said at a campaign event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday. ""He's putting the G-7 at his own resort to try and make money. It's unethical. It's one more example of why he is so unfit for office and he's going to have the American taxpayers pay for security costs and everything else that goes into hosting the G-7 straight into his pocket and it's completely inexcusable and the American people should hold him accountable for that.""

In September, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also looking to take the White House in 2020, accused Trump of urging Vice President Pence to stay at the Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg, Ireland, on an official trip in hopes of cashing in from the stay."

THE CHAOS CAUCUS GETS ITS WAY

If you read this note you certainly have more than a passing interest in politics. In fact, you’re probably one of the people to whom your friends and family turn when it comes to sorting out questions political or governmental.



That's why one of our goals each day is to so equip you. We like it if you’re the smartest political person in the room.



So if they ask you today what in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks is going on, just tell them this: The two most powerful people in the American government – the system conceived by the Founders, purchased and defended with the lives of more than a million men at arms – is the specific insult the president used toward the speaker of the house.



Hoo-boy…



President Trump said that he called Nancy Pelosi a “third-grade politician.” Pelosi and others at the brief, useless meeting on the ongoing debacle in Syria say that Trump called her a “third-rate politician.”



We will not waste your time or test your credulity by talking about how unworthy this is of our republic or of the armed forces the two were supposedly meeting to discuss, or any of that “School House Rock” goody-goody stuff. It’s 2019. We get it.



But ask yourselves what comes next.



On the 1,000th day of Trump’s presidency we find a city and a system unraveled. If we take the long view we can observe that this is, in fact, what Americans voted for in 2016. Trump promised to bring combative, disruptive partisan warfare to levels unseen even during recent low points like the Clinton impeachment and the Iraq War.



Trump has delivered on his promise to disrupt, a promise he made to core supporters starting in June 2015. One of the reasons that his devotees are attached to him in a way that sometimes border on the religious is because he has kept faith with these voters every day of his presidency. Trump likes to boast that he is a builder, but his base hired him for a demolition job.



To win the presidency, though, Trump relied on the support of voters who felt differently – a bloc at least as large as his core followership. The mandate from these voters was not to turn Washington into an apocalyptic hellscape of turgid partisanship but rather just not be Hillary Clinton.



We imagine that those voters have watched the events of the past two months in some combination of fascination, shock, amusement and horror. The cause of such consternation is pretty simple: There is very little left in Trump’s administration that reflects the winning coalition of 2016 between Trump’s populist pitchforkers and the center-right Republican establishment.



Think of it this way – Trump succeeded in an audacious hostile takeover of the Republican Party. But after the establishment was defeated, many members of the old firm stayed on in this new joint venture.



Reince Priebus, Nikki Haley, James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, Kirstjen Nielsen, Jeff Sessions, Tom Price, Elaine Chao, Dan Coats, Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pence all hitched up for the new joint venture between Trump Inc. and the GOP.



It’s down to Mulvaney, Chao and Pence, and if we were Mulvaney we wouldn’t worry about renewing our parking pass for next month.



What that means is that Trump is substantially getting the government he wanted and promised, one in which he is unconstrained by convention, tradition or nearly any rules of the road. He envisioned that as president he could operate in the same way he did as the CEO of his family business.



Of course, as it turns out, he cannot. But he has run out of those individuals who, for the first 900-or-so days, managed to make things run in some kind of orderly way.



Consider the twin snares in which Trump now finds himself bound: Impending impeachment and the foreign policy meltdown in Syria. Both are the result of Trump doing things his way rather than the Washington way.



Any chief of staff worth his salt would have dived in front of that phone call to the Ukrainian president like it was a runaway dump truck. Whether you think Trump acted appropriately or not, he conducted himself in such a way that gave his critics all the ammunition that they needed. One day after Robert Mueller’s testimony snuffed out the already dying embers of impeachment talk in Congress, Trump picked up the phone and started a conflagration.



Any national security adviser in any previous administration would have done everything but swat the phone out of the president’s hand if he was telling Turkey’s strongman president that the U.S. would clear the way for Turkish forces to pummel our Kurdish allies.



Again, you may actually agree with the policy of feeding the Kurds to the Turks, but we are left in a situation where the American Air Force is bombing American military installations to keep them out of the hands of rapidly advancing hostile forces. Those are procedural, not policy problems.



The next 12 months will determine what, if any, legacy Trump will leave behind. Trump re-elected, Trump defeated, Trump impeached but preserved by the Senate and Trump impeached and removed are all real possibilities. And no one will have as much to say about which of those eventualities comes to pass as Trump himself.



His team is in disarray and his administration lurches daily from disaster to disaster. If he does not find a way to change that it won’t matter how bad the Democrats’ nominee is, Trump will never see a second term.



Given the fact that today’s White House press conference was to announce Trump’s decision to host world leaders next year at one of his family’s golf resorts, we get the sense that maybe that reality has not yet taken root in the West Wing.



THE RULEBOOK: FOCUS ON THE POSITIVES

TIME OUT: TIMELESS JULIE ANDREWS

Atlantic: “Home Work, [Julie Andrews] second memoir (this one co-published with her eldest daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton), is an account of what happened between Andrews’s film debut in 1964’s Mary Poppins and her performance in the 1982 movie Victor/Victoria. The motivation for the book, Andrews told [The Atlantic], was twofold. After the 2008 publication of her first memoir, Home, which detailed her difficult childhood and her earliest days as a performer, fans and friends had urged her to dive into the next phase. ‘The first one ended as I was heading to Hollywood,’ she said, ‘so of course everybody said, ‘When, when, when are you going to do the next one?’ Because they wanted to hear all that.’ Home, in other words, ended right before the moment when Andrews took the role that would change her life. The book is a dance between candor and diplomacy, as Andrews navigates the imperative of honesty with the courteousness that seems to be her governing instinct.”

OUTPOURING FOR ELIJAH CUMMINGS, LION OF THE HOUSE

Baltimore Sun: “U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Baltimore, a committee chairman known for his devotion to Baltimore and civil rights and for blunt and passionate speechmaking, died of longstanding health problems early Thursday morning, his office said. He was 68 years old. The Democrat, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, at approximately 2:45 A.M., a spokeswoman said. Cummings, who had been absent from Capitol Hill in recent weeks while under medical attention, had health issues in recent years. In 2017, he underwent an aortic valve replacement. The procedure, which aides described as minimally invasive in Cummings’ case, is used to correct narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart. The surgery led to an infection that kept him in the hospital longer than expected.”



LATE IN THE RACE, DEM FAULT LINES EMERGE

WaPo: “As the party’s fourth debate concluded, the Democratic primary contest opened a more robust and unpredictable clash over the ideological direction of the party, with moderates attempting to ignite the kind of passion that the liberal candidates have harnessed with large crowds and grass-roots donor networks. After months in which the race was largely static amid a crowded, free-ranging field, the nomination fight is showing signs of narrowing its focus to fewer candidates, divided into parallel feuds in the liberal and moderate wings of the party. [Elizabeth] Warren (Mass.) is entering a crucial phase of her campaign, taking attacks from all sides for the first time since she ascended in popularity, and attempting to demonstrate she can withstand the kind of scrutiny that previously fell mostly on [Joe] Biden, who until recently held an unchallenged lead in the polls. Yet as she attempts to coalesce support on the party’s left flank, Warren faces a renewed challenge from liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)… The left’s feud is replicated in the center, where Biden faces challenges from [Pete] Buttigieg, [Amy] Klobuchar and others.”



Biden dismisses Warren as a fellow front-runner - Fox News: “One day after being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ latest debate, Joe Biden repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary front-runner alongside the former vice president. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ‘co-front-runner.’ ‘I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,’ Biden said. ‘You guys keep talking about that.’ Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that ‘Warren has done very well. She’s moved.’”



RNC raises record-setting $27.3 million in September - Fox News: “The Republican National Committee raised a record-setting $27.3 million in September and had $59.2 million cash on hand last month amid the impeachment push against President Trump -- which has fueled GOP campaign contributions heading into the 2020 election. The RNC’s September fundraising haul is the best off-cycle month in the history of both the Republican and Democratic parties. This cycle, to date, the RNC has almost tripled the Democratic National Committee’s fundraising efforts, according to the GOP, which also noted that the Democrats, as of last month, carried $7.3 million in debt. ‘While Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month—the highest ever off-cycle—to show for it,’ RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News.”



DEMS FACE TIMING QUESTION WITH IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “Democrats are in an impeachment bind. For the first time, they’re receiving a gusher of evidence to support charges that President Donald Trump abused his power for political and personal gain, pressuring Ukraine’s fledgling government to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But as more witnesses come forward to spill more secrets, the more Democrats are nervously eyeing the dwindling congressional calendar and wondering: When should we be satisfied with what we have and bring articles of impeachment to the floor? … Some Democrats say the investigation should continue until the evidence is so overwhelming it pries loose a few Republican votes, delivering a symbolic victory as Democrats hold out hope that impeachment isn’t a purely party-line issue. Others believe Democrats should exhaust the list of willing witnesses before drafting formal articles. And still others say the House already has enough evidence to move forward with impeachment immediately — from Trump’s own admission…”



McConnell readies party members for impeachment trial - WaPo: “Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican senators Wednesday to be ready for an impeachment trial of President Trump as soon as Thanksgiving, as the Senate began to brace for a political maelstrom that would engulf the nation. An air of inevitability has taken hold in Congress, with the expectation Trump will become the third president in history to be impeached — and Republicans believe they need to prepare to defend the president. While McConnell briefed senators on what would happen during a Senate trial, House GOP leaders convened what they expect will be regular impeachment strategy sessions. In their closed-door weekly luncheon, McConnell gave a PowerPoint presentation about the impeachment process and fielded questions alongside his staff and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who was a manager for the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.”



Perry says Trump sent him to Giuliani - Fox News: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose name has been mentioned in connection with President Trump’s Ukraine dealings, said in an interview published late Wednesday that the president told him to seek out Rudy Giuliani earlier this year to look into possible Ukrainian corruption. The Wall Street Journal sat down with Perry for an extensive interview and reported that the spring conversation was a sign of how closely Giuliani — a personal lawyer for Trump — worked on Ukraine policy. Giuliani's business dealings with the country were reportedly looked at by federal investigators. He denied any wrongdoing. ‘Visit with Rudy,’ Perry recalled Trump telling him. He told the paper that Trump was not convinced that Kiev ‘straightened up’ its act. Perry told the paper he never heard Trump or Giuliani talk about an investigation into the Bidens.”



Volker’s testimony revealed more concerns about Giuliani - Axios: “New details from Kurt Volker's closed-door interview indicate Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, was deeply conflicted about whether to take the job because of concerns about Rudy Giuliani's shadow involvement. Why it matters: The testimony by Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, earlier this month may help the president in the sense that it paints Giuliani, not President Trump, as the mastermind behind a campaign to get foreign leaders to investigate the Biden family and Burisma, according to sources with direct knowledge of his testimony. But it also amplifies concerns that Trump was more interested in what his personal lawyer had to say than the professionals in government. Taylor was also worried that Trump might be willing to trade away Ukraine's interests as part of a grand bargain with Russia, Volker told lawmakers. Taylor is expected to appear before members of Congress next week.”



The Judge’s Ruling: It’s impeachable if the House says it is - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains if President Trump right when he says the impeachment inquiry is unfair: “The illegitimacy argument contended that since the House has yet to vote to authorize an investigation of the president, its committees lack subpoena power. This argument contends that since impeachment seeks to overturn a valid election, it is a thinly veiled coup and thus is in violation of the Constitution. And the argument about unfairness states that the president is entitled to due process at every stage of the impeachment proceedings. These are valid political arguments. But as legal offerings, they are profoundly misguided. … Impeachment is always constitutional if it originates in the House and if its basis is arguably for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” More here.

FLEA MARKET CHEESE? REALLY?

Fresno [Calif.] Bee: “Lemoore [Calif.] police are investigating the theft of $50,000 in cheese in a crime that is believed to reach back to 2017. The investigation, launched in late August, centers around products from Leprino Foods Plant in the 300 block of Belle Haven Drive in the South Valley city. A police spokeswoman said multiple subjects have been linked to the thefts and the cheese has been sold from Fresno to Riverside counties: door-to-door, on the street, at flea markets and on social media sites. After serving warrants, detectives recovered a large amount of cheese and arrested Jairo Mariano Osorio Alvarez, 24, and Roderick Domingo Ransom, 34, both of Lemoore.”

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends"" with host Steve Doocy, Phillips said that Democrats seemingly don't even know what Biden's accomplishments are. He showed a short video put together in August, when he took to the streets to ask liberal supporters what they thought of Biden's track record.

""I'll be honest with you, I'm drawing a blank on what he accomplished,"" a man said in the video.

One woman just told Phillips: ""No.""

A younger man in a Michigan State shirt admitted, ""I don't know if I have an answer for that.""

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

""To these people's credit, I don't know if there's exactly a long laundry list of accomplishments people can point to for Joe Biden beyond saying: 'Well, he's been in D.C. for 30, 40 years. He was vice president,'"" he noted.

Phillips told Doocy Biden's platform so far based on his long career in politics is not attractive to this electorate.

""I've talked to thousands of voters in the last two years with leadership institutes...so many of them continually say, 'I want someone [who is] going to shake it up,'"" he said.

On Tuesday's fourth Democratic presidential debate, Biden claimed he was the only candidate who had gotten anything really big done.

""I think this is what happens when you're never asked the 'why.' I think so many Democrat voters, they're never asked the why of having to explain: ""Why do you support who you do? What are the accomplishments you could point to?"" Phillips told Doocy.

He added: ""If you're a Donald Trump supporter, every single time you tell someone that, it's, ""Why? Why do you?""

""So, you're always having to arm yourself in knowing the accomplishments of who you like and I think when you're not asked that why question, you see these kinds of responses,"" said Phillips.

""I think the Democrat electorate in 2020 is similar to what Republicans had in '16. They don't want an establishment candidate,"" Phillips predicted.

""So, every time Joe Biden goes up and says, 'I've been in D.C. Here's what I've done.' I think that almost drives them further from him because they don't want an establishment candidate this go-around."""

And he’s losing one of them.

Trump may have taken a step toward salvaging the situation in Syria when Vice President Pence announced in Ankara that Turkey has agreed to a temporary cease-fire. But politically, Trump suffered a rare repudiation by his party when two-thirds of House Republicans backed a resolution disapproving of his decision to withdraw American troops.

That included such leaders as Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise and Dick Cheney. Mitch McConnell has been critical in the Senate, and Lindsey Graham said he’s prepared to be “President Trump’s worst nightmare” on the issue.

ELIZABETH WARREN, DEBATE TARGET: HERE’S WHY IT MAY NOT MATTER

At the same time, the president has watched a series of diplomats march up to the House and deliver damaging testimony about him and Ukraine—including, Thursday, his appointee Gordon Sondland.

His own acting chief of staff delivered a setback Thursday by essentially admitting to a quid pro quo. Mick Mulvaney told reporters that Trump held up military aid to Ukraine: ""Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it, and that’s why we hung up the money.” In walking it back later, Mulvaney complained that ""the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump."" Except no journalistic interpretation was needed for the on-camera remarks.

And the media were practically gleeful when a White House meeting—on Syria, as it happens--ended with House Democratic leaders walking about and complaining of a Trump diatribe.

“He was insulting, particularly to the speaker,” Chuck Schumer told reporters, adding: “He called her a third-rate politician.” (Other accounts said Trump used “third-grade.”)

“What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,” Nancy Pelosi agreed.

The president’s tweeted rebuttal: “Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her ‘upstairs,’ or she just plain doesn’t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!”

Ladies and gentlemen, your United States government. And it’s worth noting that it was Trump who walked out of a meeting with Chuck and Nancy last January after a similar spat.

Commentators and even some news anchors were quick to adopt the Pelosi pushback that Trump had suffered a “meltdown.” The Democratic narrative is that he’s losing it.

This argument was bolstered, according to the media, when Trump released a shockingly blunt letter he had sent to Tayyip Erdogan:

“Let's work out a good deal! You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy — and I will…

“History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later.”

And Trump, who ran against endless wars, has defended his stance by saying the Kurds are “no angels” and “what does that have to do with the United States of America if they’re fighting over Syria’s land?”

None of this means impeachment is a step closer. Indeed, while a new Gallup poll says 52 percent of those surveyed believe Trump should be impeached and removed, only 6 percent of those are Republicans. (This is quite similar to a much-criticized Fox poll that put the top figure at 51 percent.)

But my sense is that while many Republicans welcome the chance to demonstrate their independence on foreign policy, they are still dead set against impeachment.

Still, the latest news on that front has hardly been favorable to the White House.

Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said in the little-used briefing room yesterday that federal aid to Ukraine was held up in part because of Trump’s demands that the country investigate possible corruption by Democrats.

“The look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,” Mulvaney said.

He also said of Trump: “Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it, and that’s why we held up the money.”

Sondland, meanwhile, gave the press his opening statement before testifying that Trump told him to work with Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine. He was “disappointed” by that because “the men and women of the State Department, not the president’s personal lawyer, should take responsibility.” Sondland said he didn’t realize until later that Giuliani’s goal may have been “to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president’s 2020 re-election campaign.”

The impeachment probe and the Syria situation aren’t strictly related. In fact, Pelosi made a point of saying a foreign policy disagreement would never be grounds for impeachment. But the combined force is adding to a sense of things spinning out of control—making an alleged meltdown less important than political paralysis."

""I instantly fell in love with her. And then I've fallen in love with her more every day,"" he told ABC News.

Their wedding at Melissa's apartment six days later was so hastily thrown together that neither had their families in attendance and their wedding photos were taken by a friend on his cellphone.

BIG POST-DEBATE CASH HAULS FOR BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR COULD SPELL TROUBLE FOR BIDEN

Biden, who said he's still in the ""honeymoon phase"" of his marriage, said he's come clean with Melissa about his rocky past that includes his yearslong struggle with sobriety, getting kicked out of the Navy Reserve and dating his dead brother's wife.

The 49-year-old has been the target of Republican attacks for weeks over his business dealings in Ukraine and China. He pushed back on the narrative President Trump has falsely floated that he is in hiding.

""I live my life in the open. I get in my car in the morning and I go down the road and I get coffee and I go to the same place for lunch with Melissa and I go about doing my business and my work,"" he said, adding that he seeks solace in his art studio in California - a place that ""literally keeps me sane.""

Melissa, who recently became an American citizen, said she's not worried about the intense public pressure on her husband or how it might affect his sobriety.

""He's incredibly strong,"" she said. ""We don't worry that much. I think we laugh a lot more than we worry and we try and stay in a very positive light.""

Biden, who has been thought of as a liability to his father's presidential bid in some Democratic circles, maintained his relationship with his father is strong and that they talk every day.

""I know where I stand with my dad,"" he said. ""I know where I stand with my family.""

But it's fair to say that Biden's complicated professional life, coupled with his messy personal one, has had a negative impact on his father's third bid for the presidency.

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

A deeper look into the middle child of Joe Biden and Neilia Hunter shows a man who has spent his life in the shadow of his famous father and late brother Beau, and has often made impulsive and sometimes reckless decisions both personally and professionally.

His ex-wife Kathleen Biden, whom he married in 1993, filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court on Feb. 23, 2017 seeking to freeze Biden's assets. She claimed in court documents that were leaked to the New York Post that Biden had put the family on the brink of financial ruin by spending massive amounts of money in strip clubs and on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes. It was in that motion that Kathleen dropped the bombshell that Hunter Biden was dating Hallie, his late brother's widow.

Professionally, things haven't been going Biden's way lately.

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL TOLD CONGRESS HE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS IN 2015 BUT WAS IGNORED

He's been called out and taunted by President Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry over a quid pro quo with Ukraine, as well as his son Donald Jr., who complained on Fox News that Biden has gotten through life profiting off his famous father — an accusation Trump's own adult children have faced numerous times.

For Biden, the consequences stemming from his business dealings with a Ukrainian gas company were on full display this week.

George Kent, a State Department official focused on Ukraine policy, told Congressional investigators that he had raised concerns in 2015 about Biden's role in Burisma Holdings, a gas company in Ukraine, but was turned away by a Joe Biden staffer and told that the then-vice president didn't have the ""bandwidth"" to deal with Hunter Biden's issues because his eldest son, Beau, was battling brain cancer.

Kent testified in a closed-door hearing that he worried that Ukrainian officials would view Biden as a conduit for currying favor with his father but that the concerns had been brushed off.

Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have also claimed that Biden used his father's position as vice president to secure $1.5 billion in loans for a Chinese private equity company, where he was a board member. There is currently o credible evidence to support this theory.

Still, earlier this week, Joe Biden pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were elected to be president."

But it's the tangled tale of his middle child Hunter that threatens to scuttle the former vice president's third bid for the White House.

In Democratic circles, there have been whispers for years that Hunter Biden could become a liability for his father. Questions about the younger Biden's overseas business dealings in Ukraine and China as well as his checkered past at home -- he dated his brother's widow, used cocaine, bought crack and allegedly spent so much money in strip clubs and on prostitutes that his family couldn't pay their bills -- has made him an easy target for President Trump.

Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry, has aggressively gone after chief rival Biden and his family. Some accusations the president has lobbed can be proved. The majority cannot.

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

What's true is that Hunter Biden has become a punching bag for the White House and Trump's closest allies. The 49-year-old's controversial decision to accept a high-paying position at a gas company in Ukraine with little to no experience has become the backdrop of a whistleblower complaint against Trump and is reshaping the 2020 presidential race. Trump has repeatedly accused Hunter Biden of ethical lapses and profiting off his famous father's last name -- something Trump's own children have been widely criticized for doing.

FOX NEWS POLL: RECORD SUPPORT FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT

Earlier this week, Trump tweeted, ""Where's Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raised and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.""

The social media hits against the Bidens made by a sitting president have been relentless and somewhat shifted the focus of the investigation against Trump to an attack on Hunter Biden.

On Tuesday, the younger Biden finally broke his silence, acknowledging in an ABC interview that his last name likely played a role in getting a lucrative Ukraine gig while his father was vice president and handled the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. However, he strongly pushed back on growing criticism from Republicans and the White House that he was unqualified for the positions he held on several boards.

HUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON UKRAINE BUSINESS DEALS, CLAIMS HE DID 'NOTHING WRONG AT ALL'

Hunter Biden argued that despite a lack of Ukraine or natural gas industry experience he ""had as much knowledge as anybody else on the board, if not more.""

When Hunter Biden joined the board of the gas company a half-decade ago, its owner, a former Ukrainian government minister working to rebuild Burisma Holdings' image, was facing a money-laundering investigation. In fact, the region was so rife with corruption that one of Hunter Biden's investment firm partners at the time ended his business relationship with Biden. Despite warnings of corruption, Hunter Biden stayed on and pulled in $50,000 a month, Newsweek reported.

His colleagues at Burisma included chairman Alan Apter, who had nearly three decades of experience under his belt at Merrill Lynch, Renaissance Capital, Troika Dialog and Morgan Stanley. Devon Archer, who was appointed as director of Burisma in 2014, co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners with Biden. He also served as a senior adviser to John Kerry and co-chaired the National Financial Committee.

There have also been concerns about Hunter Biden's dealings with BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company. Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani claimed that Biden used his father's position as vice president to secure $1.5 billion in loans for the Chinese private equity company, where he was a board member. There is currently no credible evidence to support the theory.

Still, earlier this week Joe Biden pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were elected to be president.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG.'

""Look, my son's statement speaks for itself,"" Biden said, adding that he never acted improperly based on payments his son was receiving from several multinational companies.

While father and son have denied any wrongdoing, Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings and drama stateside have had an impact on Biden's bid for the White House.

""Did I make a mistake? Maybe in the grand scheme of things. But did I make a mistake based on some ethical lapse? Absolutely not,"" Hunter Biden said during the ABC interview.

The powerful politician's son's woes back home have put him in the spotlight for years. And though he's been open about his drug and alcohol abuse, his bio reads like a tabloid tale, sometimes almost too out there to believe.

Hunter Biden got his law degree from Yale Law in 1996. He returned to Delaware to help his dad who was running for reelection in the Senate. and was tapped to be Biden's deputy campaign manager. He also was a lawyer with MBNA America, a banking holding company in Delaware, which happened to be one of the biggest donors to his father's campaign.

At the age of 43, Hunter Biden applied for and received an age waiver to join the Navy Reserve after being inspired by his friend Greg Keeley, an Australian-American former military officer. Keeley wrote him a letter of recommendation. The Navy has a zero-tolerance drug-and-alcohol abuse policy and asks all recruits about their prior substance use. Hunter Biden disclosed that he had used drugs in the past but said he was sober and got a second waiver from the Navy to join.

In early 2013, Hunter Biden, who had been sober for a couple of years, suffered a relapse after he was prescribed painkillers for shingles. When his prescription ran out, he began drinking again, The New Yorker reported.

On May 7, 2013 he was assigned to a Reserve unit at Naval Station Norfolk. He had hoped to work in naval intelligence but was given a job in a public affairs unit.

During his first weekend on duty, Hunter Biden stopped by a D.C. bar. He said he bummed a cigarette from two South African men and that he felt ""amped up"" at first but then exhausted as he made the three-hour drive to Norfolk. On his first day as a Navy reservist, he had a routine urine sample taken. A couple of months later he got the news that he had failed the drug test and that trace amounts of cocaine had been detected, The New Yorker reported. He was formally discharged on Feb.18, 2014.

In August 2015, Breitbart reported that Hunter Biden had set up an account on Ashley Madison, a website that connects married people who want to have affairs. The site was hacked and a list of subscribers was made public. Biden vehemently denied setting up the account and said that the profile that used his email address did not belong to him.

""I am certain that the account in question is not mine,"" Biden said. ""This account was clearly set up by someone else without my knowledge.""

Two months later, Hunter Biden and his wife Kathleen, who he married in 1993, separated. On Dec. 9, 2016, she filed for divorce. On Feb. 23, 2017, Kathleen filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court seeking to freeze Hunter Biden's assets. She claimed in a motion that was leaked to the New York Post that her husband had put the family on the brink of financial ruin by spending massive amounts of money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes. Kathleen also dropped the bombshell that Hunter was dating Hallie, his late brother Beau's widow.

Hunter Biden denied paying for prostitutes and claimed he hadn't been to a strip club in years. However, in an act of defiance, he told The New Yorker that the night after the Post article was published he ""went directly to a strip club. I said, 'f--k them.'""

As his divorce was playing out in public, his relationship with Hallie started to crumble.

""All we got is sh-t from everybody, all the time,'"" The New Yorker reported him as saying.

In 2016, Hunter Biden was supposed to go to a wellness center in Arizona but instead stayed in Los Angeles for about a week. In L.A. he purportedly asked a homeless man in Pershing Square where he could buy crack. Hunter told The New Yorker that the man took him to a nearby homeless encampment where someone put a gun to his head before realizing Hunter Biden was a prospective customer. After that incident, Hunter Biden said, he returned to buy more crack a few more times that week.

While in L.A., Hunter Biden also lost control of his rental car, damaged it and ended up calling the rental agency.

Hertz employee Zachary Romfo claimed he found a crack pipe in the car as well as a line of white powder residue on one of the consoles. Hertz notified the police and a narcotics offense report was filed. The report listed the items seized from Hunter's car, which included a plastic baggie containing a white powdery substance, a Secret Service business card, credit cards and Hunter Biden's driver's license.

His messy personal life complimented his complicated professional life.

On Aug. 23, 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama publicly introduced Joe Biden as his running mate. Hunter Biden claimed that during the primaries some of Obama's advisers had been criticizing him to reporters. He told The New Yorker that he wasn't told to end his lobbying activities but that he knew ""the writing was on the wall.""

Hunter Biden dropped his lobbying clients and stepped down from an unpaid seat on the board of Amtrak.

""I wanted my father to have a clean slate,"" Hunter Biden said. ""I didn't want to limit him in any way.""

Since then, the younger Biden has been in the spotlight and his past actions have come back to haunt him and his father.

He told The New Yorker that recently he had seen reports on Twitter that Trump was calling for him to be investigated by the Justice Department. Hunter Biden said he noticed a helicopter flying above and purportedly told his wife Melissa, whom he married in 2019, ""I hope they're taking pictures of us right now. I hope it's a live feed to the president so he can see just how much I care about his tweets.""

He added, ""I told Melissa, 'I don't care. F--k you, Mr. President. Here I am, living my life'."""

The candidates don't seem to be competing to see who can run the country most efficiently. That's the old style of politics.

Instead, these candidates are pledging to remake America entirely. Rip out the old, which is. they're telling us, irredeemably tainted by racism, sexism and free enterprise, and replace it with something completely new and different.

At the heart of this effort is the promise of ""Medicare-for-all."" Now, you may have heard the phrase. Two of the most popular Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both have endorsed it. But what exactly does it mean? What exactly is ""Medicare-for-all""?

SANDERS ACCUSES BIDEN OF PUSHING INSURANCE INDUSTRY 'TALKING POINTS' BY SLAMMING 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

It's worth finding out. It's not a tweak to some regulation. It's not even ObamaCare, which once upon a time Democrats defended and Republicans denounced as socialism.

""Medicare-for-all"" is actual socialism, for-real socialism. Health care spending amounts to about a fifth of the entire American economy. Elizabeth Warren demands total control of all of it -- immediately. That's ""Medicare-for-all."" If it becomes law, it would amount to the largest expansion of the federal government since the second World War -- by far.

So it's worth asking how exactly all of this would work and critically, who would pay for it. Elizabeth Warren has been asked that question many times, and every time, she has refused to answer.

Marc Lacey, national editor for The New York Times: Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: The costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. Hard-working, middle-class families are going to see their costs go down.

Stephen Colbert, host of ""The Late Show"": But will their taxes go up?

Warren: Well -- but here's the thing ...

Colbert: But here's the thing, I've listened to these answers a few times before --

George Stephanopoulos, ABC News host: Will middle-class taxes go up? Will private insurance be eliminated?

Warren: Look, what families have to deal with is cost -- total cost. That's what they have to deal with.

Warren: It's how much are your costs going to go down ...

Chris Matthews, host of ""Hardball"": No, no. Different question. How much of your taxes go up?

Warren: No, it's how much your cost --

Matthews: How is it a different question?

Warren: It is how much families end up spending.

Matthews: I know that argument, but will you pay more in taxes? Why don't you want to answer that question because as Jake said tonight, that's a Republican talking point. It's not a Republican talking point. It's a question.

Warren: It's a question about where people are going to come out economically.

Matthews: That's not my question.

Warren: I spent --

She will not answer. She won't explain, no matter how hard she has been pressed. And as you just saw, even some fairly strident Democratic partisans have pressed her.

Warren refuses. She will not explain what it would cost or who would pay for it.

Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional, or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren anymore.

Well, now we have a credible estimate. According to a study by the Urban Institute, in just the first 10 years, Elizabeth Warren's ""Medicare-for-all"" plan would cost an additional $34 trillion.

That sounds like a lot. How much is it? Here's some perspective.

The Congressional Budget Office anticipates that the United States -- the whole United States -- will collect just $46 trillion in taxes over the same period. In other words, Elizabeth Warren's health care plan alone will consume the overwhelming majority of all tax dollars in the United States.

That's before we spend a single dollar on -- I don't know -- Social Security, education, national defense and everything else.

It's demented.

Now, you should know that the Urban Institute has no motive to attack Elizabeth Warren. It's not a right-wing think tank. It's a left-wing think tank. They likely didn't even account for the cost of one's pledge to give free health care to every illegal alien who sneaks into the country.

So who is going to pay for all of this? Well, think of it this way: $3.4 trillion a year -- that's the estimated cost. Divide that by 320 million Americans, and you get more than $10,000 per person -- not per taxpayer, per person. That means every child, every retiree, every prison inmate, everybody.

That would be the largest tax assessed in American history by far. Nothing even comes close. That would change everything. An awful lot of people would just leave the country and not come back.

So how do you pay for ""Medicare-for-all""? It's not a minor detail we can settle later. It's the single most important question about the program. Why do you think we don't have it already? Because we can't afford it.

Elizabeth Warren pretends that's irrelevant -- and to her, maybe it is irrelevant.

At some point in the last couple of years, Warren stopped functioning as a conventional senator and became a kind of Messianic figure. Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren any more.

Warren has seen the future, and in that future, she has complete and unquestioned control of America. She is the most powerful person in the world.

You can almost hear her repeating the phrase to herself... ""The most powerful person in the world.""

It's intoxicating, clearly.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the U.S. government, responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. It was created by Congress in 2010 to be an autonomous entity, structured so each director serves a five-year term and can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

MICHAEL MOORE ENDORSES BERNIE SANDERS: 'HE ISN'T AFRAID TO SAY CAPITALISM IS THE PROBLEM'

Warren, D-Mass., touted on the campaign trail that the bureau returned $12 billion to consumers during the Obama administration, The Washington Post reported. She uses the figure to push a presidential platform based on attacking corporate greed and increasing taxes on wealthy Americans.

“Big banks and their Republican allies have been trying to kill the CFPB for years, and the Trump administration is hoping the right-wing, pro-corporate Supreme Court will help. I’ve got news for them: Like it or not, the CFPB is constitutional,” Warren said on Twitter.

An attorney for the Trump administration told the Supreme Court in a brief last month that even the bureau’s current director, Kathleen Kraninger, who was sworn in in 2018, believes the structure of the CFPB violates the separation of powers clause of the Constitution given its director cannot be fired by the president without sufficient cause.

Critics of the bureau say the Constitution gives the president the power to remove top-ranking executive branch officials for any reason or none at all. They say the founders were wary of power being entrusted to any one individual who had not been elected into office, the Washington Times reported.

The Supreme Court “has consistently recognized that the Constitution empowers the president to keep federal officers accountable by removing them from office,” Washington lawyer Kannon K. Shanmugam wrote in the brief, according to The Washington Post.

“While in limited circumstances the court has upheld the constitutionality of certain multi-member ‘independent’ agencies ... the court has never upheld the constitutionality of an independent agency that exercises significant executive authority and is headed by a single person.”

Republicans and banking executives have opposed the bureau since its inception, arguing it often pushing legal margins to slap unnecessary penalties on financial intuitions. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney once described the bureau as “a joke” and supported legislation to disband it, the Post reported.

Lower court ruling on the constitutionality of the bureau have been conflicting. A three-judge panel on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, which included then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh before he became a Supreme Court Justice, ruled the CFPB was unconstitutional. The entire court later overturned the decision, the Times reported."

In a Washington Post op-ed on Friday, Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen also took on the 2020 front-runner, writing that most voters believe the economy is working for them.

""To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump's policies but don't like Trump,"" Thiessen wrote.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may soon eclipse former Vice President Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That's great news for Republicans, because Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.

A Marist poll asked voters whether ""the economy is working well for you personally."" Nearly two-thirds of Americans said yes. This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group.

Sixty-seven percent of college graduates and 64 percent of those without a college education say the economy is working for them. So do 68 percent of whites and 61 percent of nonwhite people.

WARREN APPARENTLY GETS THE FACTS WRONG IN ANECDOTE DURING CNN INTERVIEW

So do Americans of every generation: 63 percent of Generation Z and millennials; 69 percent of Generation X; 63 percent of baby boomers; and 69 percent of Greatest Generation and Silent Generation voters.

So do supermajorities in every region in the country: 60 percent in the West, 65 percent in the Northeast, 67 percent in the Midwest, and 68 percent in the South.

So do most voters in every type of American community: 63 percent of both big and small city voters; 64 percent of small-town voters; 66 percent of rural voters and 72 percent of suburban voters.

Most everyone, it seems, says the economy is working for them.

The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59 percent), Democratic women (55 percent) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55 percent.

So, when Warren declares that President Trump is ""part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else,"" it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.

There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them.

Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And The New York Times reported in May that ""over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases.""

Americans don't just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday's debate.

This progress is bad news for Warren. Why would Americans rally to her call for ""big structural change"" to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and – whether she admits it or not – would require them to pay more in taxes?

Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren's proposals, and the numbers are staggering: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for Medicare-for-all; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing.

""Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion,"" Riedl says. And that's before calculating the cost of offering free government health care to illegal immigrants, which Warren supports.

There's no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren's wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.

No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Warren so hard at Tuesday's debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination.

To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump's policies but don't like Trump. They can't do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them, and that they need to make peace with socialism. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity.

If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy.

And since Warren said Tuesday that, if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will ""repeal the filibuster,"" she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump's message – ""whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me"" – will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg slammed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., at this week's Democratic debate over her not being clear about whether middle-class tax hikes would fund Medicare-for-all. But remarks Buttigieg made at a previous debate contradicted his hardened stance.

Buttigieg, who has campaigned on ""Medicare-for-all-who-want it,"" called out Warren for being ""evasive"" on whether her health care plan would lead to tax hikes, saying a ""yes or no question"" didn't get a ""yes or no answer.""

""Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,"" Buttigieg told Warren. ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything -- except this.""

""No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in,"" he said.

BUTTIGIEG TWEETED SUPPORT FOR MEDICARE-FOR-ALL IN RESURFACED TWEET DESPITE ATTACKING WARREN AT DEBATE

However, Buttigieg struck a different tone at the previous Democratic debate in July when he was asked ""yes or no"" by CNN moderator Jake Tapper if he was ""willing"" to raise taxes on the middle class to fund universal health care coverage.

""I think you can buy into it, that's the idea of Medicare-for-all-who-want-it,"" Buttigieg responded. “Look, this is a distinction without a difference, whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums.“

He added, ""In this country, if you don't have health care coverage, you're paying too much for care. And if you do have health coverage, you're paying too much for care.""

The Buttigieg campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News for comment.

The 37-year-old candidate also raised eyebrows this week over a resurfaced tweet from February 2018 where he professed his support for Medicare-for-all.

""I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered,"" Buttigieg wrote, responding to whether or not he supported it.

A Buttigieg aide Wednesday said that he had not changed his position on Medicare-for-all, explaining that the candidate supports it as an end goal but he wants to take a ""glide path"" to get there, The Hill reported.

Amy Klobuchar – giddy after a lack of sleep and rave reviews for her debate performance – touted to the jam-packed crowd inside a café in New Hampshire’s capital city that she raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours after Tuesday’s Democratic presidential nomination showdown.

The haul was nearly a quarter of what she brought in during the entire July-September third quarter of fundraising.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR MEDICARE-FOR-ALL

Highlighting that most of the money was from small-dollar contributions, the Minnesota Democrat told reporters “that shows something happened, that people were watching and they responded. And that is a very big deal for us.”

As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate.

His campaign touted that Wednesday was “one of our biggest fundraising days yet.” And Buttigieg communications director Lis Smith showcased that the campaign “saw more traffic to their website in the past 24 hours than any other day.”

At the debate, both Buttigieg and Klobuchar took aim at co-front runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts over how she’d pay for her proposed government-run Medicare-for-all plan.

The aggressive moves throughout the debate by both Buttigieg and Klobuchar literally paid off. And the potential surge for the two candidates trying to appeal to more centrist voters in the party could spell trouble for another more establishment contender: former Vice President Joe Biden.

AMID BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN CASH WOES, TOP ADVISERS VOW THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

Biden was the unrivaled front-runner in the race from even before he declared his candidacy in late April. But Warren caught up with him this autumn in many of the most recent national and early voting state polls. And Biden’s been eclipsed by Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Buttigieg when it comes to the crucial fundraising race.

According to his Federal Election Commission filing, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised the past three months. That’s far less than Sanders, Warren, and even Buttigieg.

“This week's debate was the best yet for Mayor Pete and Sen. Klobuchar and came at a moment of prime opportunity for them,” noted Ben LaBolt, a Democratic strategist who served as a spokesman on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign and national press secretary on the president’s 2012 re-election campaign.

LaBolt spotlighted that “Biden's vote share is more gettable for pragmatic candidates like Buttigieg and Klobuchar than it is for Warren.

Third-quarter filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show Biden has just $9 million in cash on hand, less than half of what both of his top competitors for the 2020 Democratic nomination -- Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- reported, according to The Hill.

DONNA BRAZILE: BIDEN CAMPAIGN 'NEEDS TO BE CONCERNED' ABOUT CASH WOES

“I hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,” a campaign fundraising email for Biden said. “If we don’t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.”

Less cash on hand means the campaign will struggle to respond to “twists and turns of this race — and with Donald Trump constantly pushing his false smear campaign against Joe, that’s a HUGE problem,” the letter says.

The letter closes with an appeal, according to The Hill.

“We can’t afford to fall behind, so I’m asking you to step up now and make a donation to fuel our campaign.""

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso said Biden's cash flow could dry up ""as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.""

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

The 76-year-old former vice president started off as a solid frontrunner in the polls, but more recent surveys have shown Warren either catching up or surpassing him.

However, they have a big problem: the excellent ideas are stolen from President Trump, the man they love to hate.

The Democrats would never admit they’re advocating for some parts of Trump’s successful Make America Great Again agenda. But since they’re doing it, voters have to ask: why settle for a cheap knockoff of the Trump presidency when they can reelect Trump in November 2020 and get the genuine article for four more years?

The Democratic plagiarism of Trump's ideas was on full display when 12 presidential wannabees competed for attention Tuesday night on a very crowded debate stage in Ohio.

CHARLES PAYNE: ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS TO BREAK APART AN ECONOMY THAT'S WORKING

Buried amid their grandiose claims, impeachment frenzy, and grandstanding on far-left policies were some good ideas that helped Donald Trump become President Trump.

Much of the first hour of the debate was spent on Democratic demonization of Trump and their endorsement of his impeachment to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election.

hen the Democratic candidates circled the wagons to defend one of those on stage – former Vice President Joe Biden – whose son Hunter was paid about $50,000 a month to serve on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company. Hunter had no special knowledge of Ukraine or the energy industry and had only one qualification for the high-paid position – his dad was serving as vice president and played a key role in the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy.

Later, each of the candidates spent time on his or her individual far-left radical fantasies. All endorsed various pie-in-the-sky hugely expensive health plans to increase the government’s role in health insurance and health care.

Former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke of Texas outlined his vision of nationwide gun confiscation – ignoring the Second Amendment of the Constitution that gives Americans the right to keep and bear arms.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang touted his plan to give $1,000 a month to every adult in the country – vote-buying on a grand scale that would have to be funded by raising our taxes to come up with the “free” money to give back to us.

Some of the biggest applause, however, came when the Democratic candidates delivered the exact same lines presidential candidate Donald Trump used in 2016. For instance, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts correctly pointed out that the “principal reason” for American job losses in recent decades “has been bad trade policy.”

“The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who’ve been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty … to American workers,” the Massachusetts extreme leftist declared.

Warren presented the argument as though she were the first one to think of it, adopting the posture of someone who was bravely breaking a taboo and challenging established orthodoxy. But Warren’s “eureka” moment came about four years late.

Soulless free-trade fundamentalism, international agreements that favored multinational corporations over American workers, and subservience to China’s economic bullying were the orthodoxy – under Warren’s own Democratic Party.

President Bill Clinton gave us the disastrous North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It was President Barack Obama who nearly got us locked into the even worse Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It was twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who promised Wall Street bankers that they could count on her to deliver “open trade and open borders.”

Where was Warren when Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign in 2015? He stated repeatedly in his announcement speech that American job losses were the result of our feckless negotiators letting China and other countries “kill us” on trade.

Was Warren not listening during the 2016 campaign, when Trump said that “we’re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pursued by powerful corporations” in order to achieve a trade policy that benefits American workers?

Has Warren – now a top-tier presidential candidate – not paid attention as President Trump has delivered on his campaign promises throughout his presidency?

For the record, Trump pulled us out of TPP, replaced NAFTA with an agreement that gives American workers a fair shake, imposed strategic counter-tariffs to pressure China into ending its rampant trade abuses, and created millions of new American jobs in the process.

Warren is an intelligent and politically astute woman. She knows her trade rhetoric is a carbon-copy of what Trump has been saying for over four years. But she’s just betting that her Democratic base isn’t paying attention to the world beyond its far-left bubble. After all, much of her career has been based on hoping people weren’t paying attention to the details about her background, her work history and other aspects of her life.

Even the liberal Vox website could see what was happening, observing that “Warren’s rhetoric here would hardly be out of place in a Trump speech.”

O’Rourke was even more shameless than Warren. He told the debate audience that in order to secure a level playing field for American workers we need to make sure “that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions.” The lack of Mexican labor protections, he lectured, “puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage.”

Yes, Beto, we know. That’s why President Trump criticized NAFTA vociferously throughout the 2016 campaign. It’s also why his negotiators successfully crafted the new U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement (USMCA) that will, for the first time, require that Mexican goods sold in America to be made by workers who enjoy many of the same labor protections we have in America. This will make sure that cheap and exploited foreign labor don’t undercut American workers.

O’Rourke should tell his former Democratic colleagues in the U.S. House to approve USMCA so it can take effect. Unfortunately, they’re stalling on approval because they don’t want to give Trump an accomplishment that will help him win reelection – despite the many benefits the agreement would bring to the American people.

Like O’Rourke, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is more interested in trying to damage President Trump politically with an absurd and baseless impeachment inquiry than working to help American workers.

Desperate Democrats are engaged in a hopeless task – convincing voters that the Trump presidency has been a disaster. But they are all-too eager to claim they will do some of the things Trump said he would do to improve the lives of the American people.

And while the Democrats can only make campaign promises, Trump can show he has kept his promises and has fulfilled his pledge to Make America Great Again.

“I think the Biden campaign needs to be concerned,” the former interim DNC chairwoman told “America’s Newsroom.”

Biden was overshadowed by fellow co-front-runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the fourth-round Democratic presidential nomination debate, but the former vice president has a potentially larger headache – a lack of campaign cash.

AMID BIDEN’S CASH WOES, CAMPAIGN VOWS IT HAS THE MONEY ‘TO RUN OUR RACE’

As Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.

According to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.

BIDEN'S THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING HAUL A WARNING SIGN

Ceraso, who worked on Sanders’ 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or “his cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.”

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised left him, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

“Get the burn rate down,” Brazile said, calling on Democratic voters to ""step up"" to counter the RNC, which raised a record $27.3 million last month.

“Get rid of any of those top-level consultants and put the money where it needs to be - that’s in the first four early states. There’s still time but they need to be concerned about the burn rate.""

On the roster: Buttigieg, Klobuchar get big post-debate boost - Mulvaney increases White House misery index - Dems build cash castellation around House majority - Poll shows Gardner trailing Hickenlooper - Oh, Floyd



BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR GET BIG POST-DEBATE BOOST

Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar – giddy after a lack of sleep and rave reviews for her debate performance – touted to the jam-packed crowd inside a café in New Hampshire’s capital city that she raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours after Tuesday’s Democratic presidential nomination showdown. The haul was nearly a quarter of what she brought in during the entire July-September third quarter of fundraising. Highlighting that most of the money was from small-dollar contributions, the Minnesota Democrat told reporters ‘that shows something happened, that people were watching and they responded. And that is a very big deal for us.’ As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate. His campaign touted that Wednesday was ‘one of our biggest fundraising days yet.’”



Buttigieg draws heat from black activists over fundraiser - AP: “Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to attend a Chicago fundraiser that will be co-hosted by a former city attorney who vigorously tried to block the release of a video depicting the shooting of Laquan McDonald , a black teenager whose death at the hands of police stirred months of protest and resulted in an officer’s conviction. Steve Patton, who led Chicago’s law department under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, is listed as a sponsor of the Friday event, according to an invitation obtained by The Associated Press. For months, Buttigieg has faced criticism over his own handling of race as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a racially divided city where decades of simmering racial tension erupted this summer when a white police officer shot and killed an African American man. … ‘He should adjust his schedule,’ said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, when asked about the fundraiser.”



Analysis finds Warren $30 trillion short on single-payer plan - Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren took a lot of flak at this week’s Democratic presidential debate for being evasive about the taxes needed to pay for the $30 trillion Medicare for All plan she champions. There’s a reason for being vague: Her team hasn’t yet figured out how to pay for it. ‘Her taxes as they currently exist are not enough yet to cover fully replacing health insurance,’ University of California, Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who advised the Warren campaign… Warren -- who campaigns on the theme that she has a plan for everything -- is relying on the wealthy and big corporations to pay for her vision of restructuring American society, including funding student debt, free college, universal childcare, green energy and affordable housing plans. … But she has made the strategic decision to adopt Bernie Sanders’ government-run health care plan rather than develop one of her own. … The Warren campaign said they are continuing to review revenue options to fund Medicare for All…”



Tim Alberta: Watching the Dem debate with Michael Bennet - Politico: “The instincts that guide [Michael] Bennet—being pragmatic, deliberative, restrained—are what many Americans say are precisely what’s needed to run the White House. But now, perhaps more than ever, those instincts are the opposite of what’s needed to win the White House. Once upon a time, there was a limited return on investing in outrage and demagoguery; statesmen were in high demand no matter the supply. That’s no longer the case, and not simply because a celebrity showman named Donald Trump is president of the United States. The painful reality of this political moment slides over Bennet like a barbed-wire blanket as he flops onto the couch and kicks off his faded brown dress shoes, preparing for a three-hour reality-television show that will help determine who leads the free world. All the more irksome to Bennet is the fact that five of his fellow senators are staring back at him from beneath the bright lights; he is the only member of the ‘world’s greatest deliberative body’ seeking a promotion who is excluded from the festivities.”



David Brooks: If it’s Trump vs. Warren, then what? - WaPo: “This is a memo for the politically homeless. It’s a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It’s a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do? The first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B’s or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar. These candidates are pluralists, not purists. … And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. … Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed.”



THE RULEBOOK: BUT STILL PROBLEMATIC

“It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of this body do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits prescribed for the legislative and executive departments, instead of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 50



TIME OUT: LE EWW, LE GROSS

AFP: “The Paris zoo's latest attraction is a brainless, eyeless, single-celled organism with no limbs or stomach but more than 700 genders. Meet the ‘blob’, also known by its scientific name Physarum polycephalum or ‘many-headed slime.’ Preceding humans on Earth by some 500 million years, the creature resembles a kind of slippery sponge. It appears stationary, but does cover ground – at a leisurely pace of up to [0.4 inches] per hour – in search of prey, such as mushroom spores, bacteria, and other microbes. From Saturday, members of the public can become better acquainted with ‘le blob’, which has taken up residence in a large tank at the zoo in Paris' Bois de Vincennes park. Named after the 1958 sci-fi horror movie ‘The Blob’ about an alien creature that crashes to Earth and devours residents of Pennsylvania, the real-life blob consists of a single cell, sometimes with many nuclei that can replicate their DNA and divide.”

MULVANEY INCREASES WHITE HOUSE MISERY INDEX

WaPo: “For 39 minutes Thursday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney turned the press briefing room into a sort of confession chamber, openly admitting to several acts that could deepen the legal predicament for the president. [Donald] Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he has abused his office for personal and political gain. … In admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet — and potentially illegal — part out loud. But that strategy with regard to Ukraine came in for withering criticism after Mulvaney’s appearance, and he later tried to walk back his comments. In a statement late Thursday, Mulvaney denied the quid pro quo he had previously defended as appropriate and normal.”



State Department official: Obama administration ignored Biden warnings - Fox News: “A State Department official focused on Ukraine policy told Congress this week he raised concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm in 2015, but was rebuffed by former Vice President Joe Biden’s staff, Fox News has confirmed. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who testified behind closed doors before committees spearheading the formal House impeachment inquiry, told congressional investigators that he had qualms about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. … A congressional source confirmed to Fox News on Friday that Kent testified that when he brought his concerns to the office of the vice president in 2016, his staff ‘blew him off’ and ignored the issue involving the younger Biden's role at the firm.”



Support steady for impeachment probe - Pew Research Center: “The new survey by Pew Research Center … finds that 54% currently approve of the House’s decision to conduct an impeachment inquiry, while 44% disapprove. Neither party engenders a great deal of confidence that they will be ‘fair and reasonable’ during the impeachment inquiry, the survey finds. About four-in-ten (43%) expect that the Republicans in Congress will be fair in handling the inquiry, while slightly more (47%) say the same about the Democrats in Congress. The survey, conducted on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, enables us to examine opinions about impeachment among the same group of respondents over the past month.”



Rick Perry announces year-end departure amid increasing scrutiny - NPR: “Secretary of Energy Rick Perry plans to leave his position at the end of the year, President Trump confirmed to reporters Thursday in Fort Worth, Texas. Trump praised Perry and said he already has a replacement in mind. ‘Rick has done a fantastic job,’ Trump said. ‘But it was time.’ Trump said that Perry's resignation didn't come as a surprise and that he has considered leaving for six months because ‘he's got some very big plans.’ Perry, 69, is one of Trump's original Cabinet members and recently has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry of Trump. Perry was part of what was dubbed ‘the three amigos’ — in addition to Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, former envoy to Ukraine — charged with managing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship after the White House removed the core of its Ukraine policy team last spring.”



DEMS BUILD CASH CASTELLATION AROUND HOUSE MAJORITY

Politico: “Democrats are building a financial bulwark around their House majority that’s going to be tough for Republicans to breach in 2020. Thirty-three of the 44 most vulnerable House Democrats have stashed an impressive $1 million or more in the bank well before the election year even begins. And their fundraising pace is not slowing down as they gear up to defend the chamber. Federal Election Commission reports filed this week illustrate Democrats’ formidable advantage: The 44 Democrats in the most competitive seats banked a collective $59 million so far. Nearly 30 raised $500,000 or more in the third quarter, according to a POLITICO analysis of the fundraising filings. And all but six of the so-called ‘frontliners’ have at least half a million more banked than their challengers, if they have any challenger at all. … The GOP is struggling to adapt to a changing landscape; They can no longer dismiss the strong fundraising as an anomaly when it has remained steady throughout the first three quarters of 2019.”



Can anyone beat AOC? - NYT: “It is hard to imagine a scenario where Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loses her seat next year. She has raised more than $3.4 million, is better known than some presidential candidates and handily won a district that is among the bluest in the nation. But that hasn’t stopped people — lots of them — from trying to unseat her. So far, eight Republicans and three Democrats have filed to run for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s seat in the Bronx and Queens. Two of the Republicans have each raised more than $420,000, even though no Republican has represented the Bronx in Congress in at least 50 years. … The campaigns also highlight a broader strategy by the Republican Party: turning voters’ resentment toward Ms. Ocasio-Cortez into a conduit for the party’s other electoral goals.”



POLL SHOWS GARDNER TRAILING HICKENLOOPER

KMGH: “New Colorado polling released Thursday shows that John Hickenlooper leads Sen. Cory Gardner in a theoretical Senate matchup next year by 11 percentage points and that a majority of Coloradans support the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The Keating Research-OnSight Public Affairs-Martin Campaigns (KOM) survey released Thursday afternoon was conducted by the Democratic pollsters Oct. 10-14 and polled 500 active statewide voters who cast ballots in 2016, 2017 or 2018 or signed up to vote since last November. The poll was weighted to be in line with voter turnout demographics and the margin of error was ±4.4% and was paid for by KOM.”



Former Republican launches Kansas Senate bid as a Democrat - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas lawmaker who left the Republican Party last year now hopes to become the first Kansas Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in decades. State Sen. Barbara Bollier launched her campaign for U.S. Senate on Wednesday by promising an independent approach. She condemned dysfunction in Washington as she seeks to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. … Bollier, of Mission Hills in Johnson County, is the fourth Democrat in the race and the ninth candidate overall – joining a sprawling field that includes Republicans Rep. Roger Marshall and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. In the Democratic contest, she will have to overcome serious campaigns by former federal prosecutor Barry Grissom and Manhattan Mayor Pro Tem Usha Reddi.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A small, but important correction. It is not the American Air Force at work in Syria. It is either the American air force or it is the United States Air Force/U.S. Air Force, from which I am retired with 21 years of service. The same goes for the American army or the American navy. I agree with capitalizing proper names, but prefer that it be done properly. I'm a faithful reader, an independent politically, and I appreciate your non-partisan approach. Sometimes it feels as though we who prefer listening, thinking and discussing rationally are but drowning voices in a maelstrom of partisan fury. The Halftime Report is one of the very few media outlets that I feel I can trust to report accurately and to make projections which are supported reasonably. Thank you for the time and effort you and your team put into keeping us informed.” – Dave Riley, Kasilof, Alaska



[Ed. note: Good point, Mr. Riley! Certainly no disrespect intended. I was swerving from overuse of U.S. and ran off the other side of the road. Thank you so much for your kind words, readership and, most of all, your service.]



“Chris, I hope the new Syrian ceasefire lasts longer than your pledge to remain neutral about Trump in your Halftime Report.” – Scott Lyddon, Savannah, Ga.



[Ed. note: I’ve got to give it to you, Mr. Lyddon. That was pretty good! And since the cease fire seems to have ended before it really began, you may be now doubly right from your own perspective. I would remind you though that the goal here isn’t to be “neutral,” but rather to be useful. Fair analysis will necessarily include criticism. If there were no criticism – true neutrality – we would lose the capacity to render necessary judgments. My promise to you, however, is that I do not and will not make judgement about ideological rights and wrongs. As we wrote Thursday, we hold harmless those who either support or oppose the president’s policies in Syria. The same goes for the competing opinions about whether the president should be removed from office for leaning on the Ukrainians to investigate his political foes. Both positions are defensible and substantially irrelevant to my work. Our point Thursday was that however you feel about the policies, Trump’s chaotic governance and indiscipline is creating political liabilities. This week has been a brutal one for the administration, most of it needlessly so. I hope, whatever resentments you may hold for my rejection of neutrality, you still find the analysis useful.]



“As much as I admire moderation in the body politic, it seems that we are rapidly approaching a choice for those of us with (R) on our voting status. I find much of the President's language and combative behavior appalling, however he is generally consistent with my views on policy. But I am APPALLED by the full throated embrace of Socialism that is occurring on the other ‘side of the aisle.’ If we ‘moderate conservatives’ sit this one out (as probably occurred with the evangelical Christians in 2012), I believe the result could be an upheaval of our American way of life, facilitated by the most massive transfer of wealth in history.” – Patsy Fields, Aliso Viejo, Calif.



[Ed. note: Well, I’ve got good news and bad news for you, Ms. Fields. The bad news is that we are indeed already in the midst of an upheaval of American life. The changes we’re seeing in how we live, work, play, worship, mate, learn and communicate are massive in scope. You would have to go back a century or more to find a moment that even comes close to the enormous societal and, consequently, political change that has wracked American society over the past 20 years. No matter how you vote, that toothpaste isn’t going back in the tube. Neither party nor any politician has the answer for dealing with all of these changes. The far left believes economic collectivism based on an ambition for social justice is the answer, while the far right champions a sort of cultural collectivism supported by economic nationalism in which the government works to engineer a new American culture to its supporters liking. Both will probably fail to achieve their highest aims. And that’s the good news. As we have done many times before, the rest of us will just have to figure it out, making it up as we go. It’s going to be bumpy, but I remain confident that it’s going to be great.]

OH, FLOYD

NY Daily News: “A leisurely Sunday afternoon hike on a mountain trail outside of Salt Lake City turned into an animal rescue after Floyd, a 3-year-old, 190-pound Mastiff, decided he was too tired to descend and wouldn’t budge. Around 6:30 p.m. as temperatures were dropping, rescuers were called after other hikers stumbled upon Floyd and his owner. Luckily, the all-volunteer Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office search and rescue team was able strap Floyd into a stretcher and carry the big fella down to the trailhead without further incident. ‘They had no hesitation whatsoever, even when they heard it was a dog,’ Sgt. Melody Gray of the Unified Police Department, which works with the sheriff’s search and rescue team, told CNN. She added the whole operation lasted about four hours.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“What’s so remarkable is that constitutions are highly reactionary documents. The very essence of a constitution is to constrain the enthusiasms of a future that one cannot even see.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) in a column from Krauthammer’s posthumous book, “The Point of It All,” published in the Washington Post on Nov. 29, 2018.

Beto O'Rourke, one of the Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020, urged Republicans in Congress to envoke a clause of the Constitution that potentially would block President Trump from hosting the G-7 summit at a Trump resort in Doral, Fla.

The White House announced the venue of the summit, scheduled to take place between June 10 and 12, at a news conference on Thursday, which incited controversy immediately, raising questions about the optics and ethics of the president personally profiting off an official government event.

Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney attempted to quell outcry by telling the media that Trump will not make any money off the event, adding that the Trump National Doral Golf Club will be providing the location and services at a cost.

""The Constitution clearly bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign powers,"" O'Rourke tweeted. ""Congress must use its authority to enforce the Emoluments Clause now to stop President Trump from profiting off of the G-7 Summit by hosting it at his own property.""

""The question isn't whether President Trump has violated the emoluments clause-- or committed other high crimes. The question is whether Republicans in Congress believe our president is above the law,"" he also wrote.

The emoluments clause was intended to prevent foreign states from influencing the U.S. government and generally prohibits presidents from taking any forms of payment from other nations.

Trump has argued that the clause referred to a ban on outright bribes, not business transactions, and that he will continue to do business with foreign governments at his hotels.

Trump repeatedly has faced allegations of enriching himself by utilizing his business entities around the globe to house or host foreign dignitaries and domestic politicians.

Another presidential candidate, Julián Castro, a former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama, also slammed Trump over his decision to hold the summit at one of his properties, which was one of 12 potential sites being considered for the event, according to Mulvaney.

""It's a terrible decision by President Trump to put the G-7 on a gulf course at his own hotel,"" Castro said at a campaign event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday. ""He's putting the G-7 at his own resort to try and make money. It's unethical. It's one more example of why he is so unfit for office and he's going to have the American taxpayers pay for security costs and everything else that goes into hosting the G-7 straight into his pocket and it's completely inexcusable and the American people should hold him accountable for that.""

In September, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also looking to take the White House in 2020, accused Trump of urging Vice President Pence to stay at the Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg, Ireland, on an official trip in hopes of cashing in from the stay."

Ocasio-Cortez, who has quickly become one of the most prominent left-wing House lawmakers since taking office in January, backed Sanders formally at the rally in Long Island City. She credited Sanders with having inspired her to embark on her own long-shot political bid, in which she ousted longtime Rep. Joe Crowley last year.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

""It wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,” she said.

In her remarks, she talked about her own personal story of growing up in New York and painted a grim picture of America, telling the crowd: “We are all always, it feels like, one accident from everything falling apart and we have to change the fundamental logic of a system and a politics that puts corp profit ahead of all human and planetary costs.”

But she said Sanders had spent decades for fighting for those things to make life for her better, such as the Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP), universal health care, and student debt forgiveness.

“Bernie Sanders did not do these things because they were popular and that’s what we need to remember,” she said. “No one wanted to question this system and in 2016 he fundamentally changed politics in America.”

MICHAEL MOORE ENDORSES BERNIE SANDERS: 'HE ISN'T AFRAID TO SAY CAPITALISM IS THE PROBLEM'

“We right now have one of the best Democratic presidential primary fields in a generation and much of that is thanks to the work that Bernie Sanders has done throughout his entire life,” she said.

The endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, along with other members of The Squad, -- the progressive group of freshman lawmakers -- marks a needed win for Sanders during a difficult few weeks for his campaign.

He has found himself trailing behind both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in a number of polls, and has been recovering from surgery after a heart attack. The latter has raised questions about his stamina for not only the grueling presidential race, but also at least a term in the White House.

In his remarks on Saturday, Sanders sought to quash doubts about whether he could continue, stressing his commitment to continuing his “political revolution”

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends"" with host Steve Doocy, Phillips said that Democrats seemingly don't even know what Biden's accomplishments are. He showed a short video put together in August, when he took to the streets to ask liberal supporters what they thought of Biden's track record.

""I'll be honest with you, I'm drawing a blank on what he accomplished,"" a man said in the video.

One woman just told Phillips: ""No.""

""To these people's credit, I don't know if there's exactly a long laundry list of accomplishments people can point to for Joe Biden beyond saying: 'Well, he's been in D.C. for 30, 40 years. He was vice president,'"" he noted.

Phillips told Doocy Biden's platform so far based on his long career in politics is not attractive to this electorate.

""I've talked to thousands of voters in the last two years with leadership institutes...so many of them continually say, 'I want someone [who is] going to shake it up,'"" he said.

On Tuesday's fourth Democratic presidential debate, Biden claimed he was the only candidate who had gotten anything really big done.

""I think this is what happens when you're never asked the 'why.' I think so many Democrat voters, they're never asked the why of having to explain: ""Why do you support who you do? What are the accomplishments you could point to?"" Phillips told Doocy.

He added: ""If you're a Donald Trump supporter, every single time you tell someone that, it's, ""Why? Why do you?""

""So, you're always having to arm yourself in knowing the accomplishments of who you like and I think when you're not asked that why question, you see these kinds of responses,"" said Phillips.

""I think the Democrat electorate in 2020 is similar to what Republicans had in '16. They don't want an establishment candidate,"" Phillips predicted.

""So, every time Joe Biden goes up and says, 'I've been in D.C. Here's what I've done.' I think that almost drives them further from him because they don't want an establishment candidate this go-around."""

And he’s losing one of them.

Trump may have taken a step toward salvaging the situation in Syria when Vice President Pence announced in Ankara that Turkey has agreed to a temporary cease-fire. But politically, Trump suffered a rare repudiation by his party when two-thirds of House Republicans backed a resolution disapproving of his decision to withdraw American troops.

That included such leaders as Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise and Dick Cheney. Mitch McConnell has been critical in the Senate, and Lindsey Graham said he’s prepared to be “President Trump’s worst nightmare” on the issue.

ELIZABETH WARREN, DEBATE TARGET: HERE’S WHY IT MAY NOT MATTER

At the same time, the president has watched a series of diplomats march up to the House and deliver damaging testimony about him and Ukraine—including, Thursday, his appointee Gordon Sondland.

His own acting chief of staff delivered a setback Thursday by essentially admitting to a quid pro quo. Mick Mulvaney told reporters that Trump held up military aid to Ukraine: ""Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it, and that’s why we hung up the money.” In walking it back later, Mulvaney complained that ""the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump."" Except no journalistic interpretation was needed for the on-camera remarks.

And the media were practically gleeful when a White House meeting—on Syria, as it happens--ended with House Democratic leaders walking about and complaining of a Trump diatribe.

“He was insulting, particularly to the speaker,” Chuck Schumer told reporters, adding: “He called her a third-rate politician.” (Other accounts said Trump used “third-grade.”)

“What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,” Nancy Pelosi agreed.

The president’s tweeted rebuttal: “Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her ‘upstairs,’ or she just plain doesn’t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!”

Ladies and gentlemen, your United States government. And it’s worth noting that it was Trump who walked out of a meeting with Chuck and Nancy last January after a similar spat.

Commentators and even some news anchors were quick to adopt the Pelosi pushback that Trump had suffered a “meltdown.” The Democratic narrative is that he’s losing it.

This argument was bolstered, according to the media, when Trump released a shockingly blunt letter he had sent to Tayyip Erdogan:

“Let's work out a good deal! You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy — and I will…

“History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later.”

And Trump, who ran against endless wars, has defended his stance by saying the Kurds are “no angels” and “what does that have to do with the United States of America if they’re fighting over Syria’s land?”

None of this means impeachment is a step closer. Indeed, while a new Gallup poll says 52 percent of those surveyed believe Trump should be impeached and removed, only 6 percent of those are Republicans. (This is quite similar to a much-criticized Fox poll that put the top figure at 51 percent.)

But my sense is that while many Republicans welcome the chance to demonstrate their independence on foreign policy, they are still dead set against impeachment.

Still, the latest news on that front has hardly been favorable to the White House.

Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said in the little-used briefing room yesterday that federal aid to Ukraine was held up in part because of Trump’s demands that the country investigate possible corruption by Democrats.

“The look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,” Mulvaney said.

He also said of Trump: “Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the D.N.C. server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it, and that’s why we held up the money.”

Sondland, meanwhile, gave the press his opening statement before testifying that Trump told him to work with Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine. He was “disappointed” by that because “the men and women of the State Department, not the president’s personal lawyer, should take responsibility.” Sondland said he didn’t realize until later that Giuliani’s goal may have been “to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president’s 2020 re-election campaign.”

The impeachment probe and the Syria situation aren’t strictly related. In fact, Pelosi made a point of saying a foreign policy disagreement would never be grounds for impeachment. But the combined force is adding to a sense of things spinning out of control—making an alleged meltdown less important than political paralysis."

""I instantly fell in love with her. And then I've fallen in love with her more every day,"" he told ABC News.

Their wedding at Melissa's apartment six days later was so hastily thrown together that neither had their families in attendance and their wedding photos were taken by a friend on his cellphone.

BIG POST-DEBATE CASH HAULS FOR BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR COULD SPELL TROUBLE FOR BIDEN

Biden, who said he's still in the ""honeymoon phase"" of his marriage, said he's come clean with Melissa about his rocky past that includes his yearslong struggle with sobriety, getting kicked out of the Navy Reserve and dating his dead brother's wife.

The 49-year-old has been the target of Republican attacks for weeks over his business dealings in Ukraine and China. He pushed back on the narrative President Trump has falsely floated that he is in hiding.

""I live my life in the open. I get in my car in the morning and I go down the road and I get coffee and I go to the same place for lunch with Melissa and I go about doing my business and my work,"" he said, adding that he seeks solace in his art studio in California - a place that ""literally keeps me sane.""

Melissa, who recently became an American citizen, said she's not worried about the intense public pressure on her husband or how it might affect his sobriety.

""He's incredibly strong,"" she said. ""We don't worry that much. I think we laugh a lot more than we worry and we try and stay in a very positive light.""

Biden, who has been thought of as a liability to his father's presidential bid in some Democratic circles, maintained his relationship with his father is strong and that they talk every day.

""I know where I stand with my dad,"" he said. ""I know where I stand with my family.""

But it's fair to say that Biden's complicated professional life, coupled with his messy personal one, has had a negative impact on his father's third bid for the presidency.

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

A deeper look into the middle child of Joe Biden and Neilia Hunter shows a man who has spent his life in the shadow of his famous father and late brother Beau, and has often made impulsive and sometimes reckless decisions both personally and professionally.

His ex-wife Kathleen Biden, whom he married in 1993, filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court on Feb. 23, 2017 seeking to freeze Biden's assets. She claimed in court documents that were leaked to the New York Post that Biden had put the family on the brink of financial ruin by spending massive amounts of money in strip clubs and on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes. It was in that motion that Kathleen dropped the bombshell that Hunter Biden was dating Hallie, his late brother's widow.

Professionally, things haven't been going Biden's way lately.

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL TOLD CONGRESS HE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS IN 2015 BUT WAS IGNORED

He's been called out and taunted by President Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry over a quid pro quo with Ukraine, as well as his son Donald Jr., who complained on Fox News that Biden has gotten through life profiting off his famous father — an accusation Trump's own adult children have faced numerous times.

For Biden, the consequences stemming from his business dealings with a Ukrainian gas company were on full display this week.

George Kent, a State Department official focused on Ukraine policy, told Congressional investigators that he had raised concerns in 2015 about Biden's role in Burisma Holdings, a gas company in Ukraine, but was turned away by a Joe Biden staffer and told that the then-vice president didn't have the ""bandwidth"" to deal with Hunter Biden's issues because his eldest son, Beau, was battling brain cancer.

Kent testified in a closed-door hearing that he worried that Ukrainian officials would view Biden as a conduit for currying favor with his father but that the concerns had been brushed off.

Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have also claimed that Biden used his father's position as vice president to secure $1.5 billion in loans for a Chinese private equity company, where he was a board member. There is currently o credible evidence to support this theory.

Still, earlier this week, Joe Biden pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were elected to be president."

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

We begin with breaking news. President Trump announced by tweet last night he's backing off his controversial decision to hold the G7 Summit next year at his own resort. He says the search will now begin for a new site.

But the president is still under fire even from a growing number of Republicans. GOP congressmen voted by more than 2-1 against his policy in Syria. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the president at a political quid pro quo from USA to Ukraine. Mulvaney later denied he said it, and more damaging testimony in the House impeachment investigation.

In a moment we will talk with the president chief of staff who just flinched when I said that.

But, first, let's bring in Kevin Corke with the latest from the White House -- Kevin.

KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, a precarious pause perhaps describes the tenuous nature of the circumstance on the ground in Syria as sporadic skirmishes continue to speckle the region, even as we learn much more about the U.S. strategy for American forces there.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARK ESPER, DEFENSE SECRETARY: The current game plan is for those forces to reposition into western Iraq, the ones coming out, right? That original 1,000. And then two missions -- one is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission.

Back in Washington, the impeachment drumbeat reached a fevered pitch as House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff interviewed a cascade of Trump administration officials but Ukraine and a possible quid pro quo tying USA aid to cooperation with a probe into the Biden's business dealings.

Incredibly, the gulf between House Democrats and the White House seem to grow, when Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stormed out of a White House meeting, accusing the president of having a meltdown over a bipartisan House vote rebuking his pullout in Syria. All as the president late Saturday rescinded his decision to host next year's G7 Summit at his resort in Miami, tweeting: Based on both media and Democrat crazed and irrational hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral Miami -- a reversal that came after withering criticism and accusations of self- dealing.

Can you at least understand and acknowledge that the -- just the appearance of impropriety makes us wince inducing and maybe this is something you maybe want to reconsider?

MULVANEY: He got over that a long time ago. We absolutely believe this is the best place to have it and we are going to have it there.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE: That was then, this is now. By the way, in that tweet, Chris, the president mentioned Camp David as a possible location for next year's G7 summit. It last hosted the G8 back in 2012 -- Chris.

WALLACE: Kevin Corke, reporting from the White House, Kevin, thanks from that.

Joining us now for an exclusive interview, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.

Mick, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"".

MULVANEY: Good morning.

Yes, I flinched a little bit because that's what people are saying that I said, but I didn't say that. But I'm looking forward to the conversation.

WALLACE: All right. Let's have a conversation.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Why -- here's my first question. Why did you say that in that briefing that President Trump had ordered a quid po qro (ph) -- quid pro quo, that investigating the Democrats, that aid to Ukraine depended on investigating the Democrats? Why did you say that?

MULVANEY: Again, that's not what I said. That's what people said I said.

Here's what I said, I'll say it again and hopefully people will listen this time.

There were two reasons that we held up the aid. We talked about this at some length. The first one was the rampant corruption in Ukraine. Ukraine -- by the way, Chris, it's so bad in Ukraine that in 2014, Congress passed a law making it -- making us -- requiring us to make sure that corruption was moving in the right direction. So, corruption is a big deal, everyone knows it.

The president was also concerned about whether or not other nations, specifically European nations, were helping with foreign aid to the Ukraine as well. We talked about that for quite a while now.

I did then mention that in the past, the president had mentioned for me to time to time about the DNC server. He had mentioned the DNC server to other people publicly. He even mentioned it to President Zelensky in the phone call, but it wasn't connected to the aid. And that's where I think people got sidetracked this weekend at that press conference.

WALLACE: But --

MULVANEY: Two reasons for holding back the aid --

WALLACE: Let me pursue that, though --

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: -- because I believe that anyone listening to what you said in that briefing could come to only one conclusion. Let's play what you said.

MULVANEY: Sure.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Did he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it, and that's what we held up the money.

REPORTER: What you just described is a quid pro quo. It is, funding will not flow unless the investigation into the -- into the Democrats' server happened as well.

MULVANEY: We do -- we do that all the time with foreign policy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl, was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aide?

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, it happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Yes. But go back and watch what I said before that. I don't know if you guys can cue it or not. There was a long answer about corruption and a long answer about foreign aid.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: No, you totally said that.

MULVANEY: Just like I told you then, and then I said the exact same thing I just said now, which is that he mentioned in passing yes, but the reason that we held back the aid with the two reasons I mentioned. And I can prove it to you. The aid flowed.

Once we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually -- they were doing better with it, we got that information from our folks from the conversation with Minister (ph) Zelensky and once we were able to establish we had the Office of Management and Budget do research on other countries' aid to Ukraine, it turns out they don't get any lethal aid, but they do give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid.

Once those two things were cleared, the money flowed. There was never any connection between the flow of money and the server.

WALLACE: But, Mick, you know, I hate to go through this, but you said what you said.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: And the fact is, after that exchange with Jonathan Karl, you were asked another time why the aide was held up. What was the condition for the aid? And you didn't mention two conditions, you mentioned three conditions.

And I want to -- and let's listen to all three of them because this -- you stated it very clearly. Let's listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Three issues for that. The corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That's completely legitimate.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Not only did you say that investigating the Democrats was one of the three conditions, not two, that you would just said that you would talk about, investigating the Democrats was part of the quid pro quo. You also said, if I may, it was part of the Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.

But the fact is that not only did the press think you said it, here's what a statement that was put out by a senior Justice Department official: If the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.

Everybody thinks that that's what you said and you didn't. You said right there --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- three points, not two.

MULVANEY: Well, and a couple different things. You again said just a few seconds ago that I said there was a quid pro quo. I never used that language, because there is not a quid pro quo, but --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: You were asked by Jonathan Karl, is -- you described a quid pro quo, and you said, that happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Well -- and reporters will use their language all the time. So, my language never said quid pro quo.

But let's get to the heart of the matter. Go back and look at that list of three things. What was I talking about? Things that was legitimate for the president to do.

Number one, it is legitimate for the president to want to know what's going on with the ongoing investigation into the server. Everybody acknowledges that -- at least I think most normal people do. It's completely legitimate to ask about that.

Number two, it's legitimate to tie the aid to corruption. It's legitimate to tie the aid to foreign aid from other countries. That's what I was talking about with the three.

Can I see how people took at the wrong way? Absolutely. But I never said there were was quid pro quo, because there isn't.

Again, Chris, you've been in these -- in these briefings. You know how back-and-forth is. You know how rapid-fire it is. Look to the facts on the ground, things that you can actually sort of certify.

And what should put this issue to bed is that the money flowed without any connection whatsoever to the DNC server.

WALLACE: But you -- in your first answer which I gave, you said that's why we held up the money. First, you just said here, that it was for two reasons. Now, you're acknowledging it was for three reasons.

If you held up the money for three reasons, that was -- that's a quid pro quo.

MULVANEY: I am not --

WALLACE: You got to satisfy us on those. Now, maybe the president backed off that, but that was the proposition here.

MULVANEY: I'm not acknowledging there's three reasons. Again, let's go back --

WALLACE: You said three reasons.

MULVANEY: Go back -- I recognize that. Go back to what actually happened in the real world.

And, by the way, go to the phone call, go to the phone call, which we've released. I hope you get a chance to talk about that before the --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I am going to right now.

MULVANEY: You go to the phone call, the president never mentions the aid at all in the phone call. Doesn't say, oh, by the way, I need you to do this, this, this and this or else the money won't flow.

We all know enough about this president that if he feels very strongly about something, he's going to put that out there directly and that didn't happen.

I recognize that folks -- that I didn't speak clearly maybe on Thursday, folks misinterpreted what I said, but the facts are absolutely clear and they are there for everyone to see.

WALLACE: In the briefing you flatly denied any connection between holding up the aide and investigating Joe Biden and his son, right?

MULVANEY: Correct.

WALLACE: OK. In his phone call with President Zelensky, however, President Trump specifically mentions the Bidens. Do me a favor. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani pushed all summer for Ukraine to announce it was investigating Burisma, the company that paid Hunter Biden.

And a former NSC official testified this week before Congress, John Bolton was so disturbed by the way you are directing people to work with Rudy Giuliani, he said, quote, I am not part of whatever drug deal -- he was speaking metaphorically --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- of whatever drug deal Sondland, the U.S. diplomat, and Mulvaney are cooking up.

No question you are following the president's orders, but your fingerprints are all over linking aid to Ukraine with investigating the Bidens.

MULVANEY: OK. No, that's not true. Let's go -- I'll take one of those of the time which is the Bolton thing, because I read that and I was surprised, because John Bolton never complained to me about it. No one at NSC ever complained to me about anything that was going on.

I didn't see Sondland's testimony this week because none of us have seen Sondland's testimony, which is another story entirely. I did get a chance to read his opening statement when he said that Bolton never complained to him. Fiona Hill never got a chance to complain to him.

I think you need to put sort of --

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Fiona Hill is the one who testified. That's the quote came from her.

MULVANEY: Who never complained to Sondland about what was happening, when it was happening.

WALLACE: No, she complained to her boss, John Bolton.

MULVANEY: Who did what?

WALLACE: Who said -- who told her to go immediately to a lawyer --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- at NSC and to complain about it.

MULVANEY: Who works for John Bolton. Yet John Bolton didn't go say anything to anybody. Doesn't that raise a red flag?

But let's go back to the first thing you talk about, which is the president's phone call, because at the end of the day, that's what this is really about, right? That's why we are here was the president phone call with Ukraine.

And you've done the same thing, and I don't blame you personally. Done the same thing with many news outlets have done. You said, do me a favor and then immediately to the Bidens.

Go look at the transcript of the phone conversation.

WALLACE: I have.

MULVANEY: It's, do me a favor, take a look at the DNC server. Then he talks about corruption in the Ukraine. He talks about Rudy Giuliani.

The president of the Ukraine gets on and he talks about a close cooperation between the countries. He talks about corruption. He talks about getting a new ambassador to the U.S.

And the president gets on and talks about Bill Barr. The president talks about a new ambassador between our countries, and then the very end of that passage mentions the Bidens.

Everybody else puts it on TV and says, do me a favor, look at the Bidens. And that's simply not factually accurate.

Go look at the transcript yourself.

WALLACE: Let's turn to Syria. Defense Secretary Esper overnight has said that those thousand troops who are being moved out of Syria are moving to Iraq. They are not as the president claimed coming home.

MULVANEY: Well, they will eventually. I think --

WALLACE: Eventually?

MULVANEY: The quickest way to get them out of danger was to get them into Iraq. Keep in mind what you are facing here. And I think literally the number was 28. You had 28 U.S. Special Forces between tens of thousands of soldiers on one side and tens of thousands of soldiers on the other side.

And I hope that when we release the letter this week, it put -- it put to the bed this nonsense about how the president supposedly green-lighted this invasion. Nothing would be further from the truth and I think the letter made that painfully clear.

WALLACE: No, no, the letter has been released.

MULVANEY: It has been, but I hope now people realize and -- it was -- listen, this is what we deal with this administration all the time. Whether it's on the impeachment or it's on the Ukraine or -- excuse me, on Syria, is people (ph) say, oh, there's a green light. The president green- lighted this and that's what the press reports.

And then we put out facts that absolutely put that to bed and no one comes back and says, well, we were wrong about that.

Go back to the beginning of the impeachment, how did that start, oh, there were supposedly a transcript with eight references to the Bidens and a quid pro quo on foreign aid -- absolutely false. No one ever went back and said, we were wrong about that either.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: So --

WALLACE: I do -- I'm running out of time and I do have several more questions.

MULVANEY: Lots of things to talk about.

WALLACE: Yes, we do.

I just want to go back to the briefing for one minute. After the briefing and all the blowback and the criticism, did you ever offer or think to offer the president your resignation?

MULVANEY: No, absolutely not.

WALLACE: Was that ever discussed?

MULVANEY: Absolutely, positively not.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: No, I'm -- listen, I'm very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference? No. But again, the facts were on our side.

I didn't get a chance to talk about some of the stuff I wanted to talk about at that press conference, which was, for example, Senator Menendez sending a letter to the Ukraine saying, if you don't cooperate with Mueller, there will be repercussions for you. I haven't had a chance to talk about -- talk about a quid pro quo, Joe Biden admitting that he said he was going to cut off funding unless the prosecutor got fired. If that's not a quid pro quo, I don't know what it is.

So, I haven't a chance at the presser to do everything I wanted to, but I still think I'm doing a pretty good job as the chief of staff and I think the president agrees.

WALLACE: There seems to be a growing number of Republicans in Congress who are -- if not breaking with the president, distancing themselves from the president.

You had Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who wrote a scathing article about Syria this week. I'm going to put up one of these quotes.

Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake and a strategic nightmare for our country.

House Republicans voted against the Trump policy in Syria 129-60, more than 2-1.

And I talked to a very well-connected Republican in Washington this week, somebody whose name you would know well, who says that if the House votes to impeach and it gets to a trial in the Senate, there is now a 20 percent chance he believes -- obviously, it's just an estimate -- now a 20 percent chance enough Republicans will vote with the Democrats to remove the president.

MULVANEY: Oh, that's just absurd. But let's deal with the issue of Syria.

WALLACE: No, let's deal with the issue of whether Republicans -- you're losing your support.

MULVANEY: Same thing. This comment about a 20 percent chance, the person clearly doesn't know what they're talking about.

But talk about the reaction of the Republicans and Democrats up on the Hill to the decision in Syria, president knew that was going to happen. He recognizes the fact that it's not a politically popular in this town to make the decision that he made to move the troops out of Syria. He ran on it. He told people he would do this if he won and he's doing it now because he won.

WALLACE: Forgive me for interrupting, we are running out of time, I just want to ask you, though -- is there any concern that the president is losing those support of Republicans in Congress?

MULVANEY: No, the president is extraordinary popular back home, more popular in the swing districts now that impeachment has started.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I'm talking about here in Washington.

MULVANEY: Yes, but they -- they have to go home eventually as well. So, no.

Do I have to understand that there are certain folks, especially the neoconservative wing of the party who are upset about the Syria decision? I absolutely do. The president knew that was going to happen.

Again, elections have consequences on foreign policy. That's where we started this conversation and that thankfully they do.

WALLACE: Two final questions. One, a -- one of the people who was testifying in Congress this week in the House impeachment investigation also said that he was so concerned about Hunter Biden getting that job in Ukraine in 2015 that he went to the vice president staff, Biden was then vice president, and said, this looks really bad. And that he was turned away.

Your reaction?

MULVANEY: Good. I'm surprised I haven't heard about it since. My guess is if it happened (ph) during the Trump administration, the news media would have reported on it at very next day.

WALLACE: I'm asking you about it, sir.

MULVANEY: I know you are. And I appreciate that. I'm hearing about it for the first time, I look forward to finding out more about it. It's the first I've heard of that piece of information.

WALLACE: You had not heard -- it's been reported widely in the last 48 hours.

MULVANEY: No, I've been busy in the last 48 hours, Chris.

WALLACE: OK. Well, let me ask you of something else, maybe you don't know this.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: But President Trump has decided after he put you out there in that briefing --

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: -- to announce Doral -- he is back -- he's decided that he's not going to hold it at Doral. He blames it on, quote, the hostile media and their Democratic partners.

But again, he was getting hammered by Republicans. So, why did he cave?

MULVANEY: I -- we talked about it at great length last night, and it's not lost on me that if we made the decision on Thursday, we wouldn't have had the press conference on Thursday regarding -- regarding everything else, but that's fine.

But we did talk about it last night and I honestly think what he is out in the tweet was real. The president isn't one for holding back his feelings and his emotions about something. He was honestly surprised at the level of pushback.

At the end of the day, you know, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world, and he wanted to put the absolute best show, the best visit that he possibly could. And he was very comfortable doing it at Doral, and I think we're all surprised at the level of pushback.

I think it's the right decision to change. We'll have to find someplace else. And my guess is we'll find someplace else that the media won't like either for another reason.

WALLACE: I just have to pick up -- you say he considers himself in the hospitality business.

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: He's the president of the United States.

MULVANEY: Yes, but he's -- that's his background. It's like, I used to be in the real estate business. I don't know what you used to do before you were in the media.

WALLACE: Nothing. That's all I've ever done.

MULVANEY: Yes.

But he wanted to put on a show. He wanted to take care of folks. That's the business -- he's in the hotel business or at least he was before he was the president.

WALLACE: Does he understand -- forget the media -- does he understand that it looked lousy?

MULVANEY: Well, I think he knows. He thinks people think it looks lousy.

Could we have put on an excellent G7 at Doral? Absolutely. Will we end up putting on an excellent G7 someplace else? Yes, we will.

WALLACE: Mick, thank you. Thanks for coming in. Always good to talk with you, sir.

MULVANEY: It's always good to be here. Thank you, sir.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss where the House impeachment investigation stands now. And new evidence U.S. officials were concerned as far back as 2015 about Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: For three straight years, radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great, great election -- maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump rallying supporters in Dallas against the House impeachment investigation.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz; FOX News political analyst Juan Williams; former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman; and from ""The Wall Street Journal"", Kimberley Strassel, author of the new book, ""Resistance (At All Cost"".

Well, Congressman Chaffetz, let me start with you. How damaging do you think the last week has been to President Trump? Testimony from a number of current and former national security officials that the president had Rudy Giuliani's personal lawyer running off-the-books operations when it came to Ukraine. And whatever you make of them, Mick Mulvaney's comments about a quid pro quo?

JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN, R-UT: Well, I wish there was video to show of what was going on in these so-called impeachment hearings because they haven't been open and transparent. I think what Adam Schiff did when he lied, he physically lied in front of the committee when he had a chance to go and talk about that, I don't think they're laying a glove on Donald Trump.

Inside the beltway, there's a frenzy. Out in the heartland, in the Dallas, Texases of the world, it's not moving the meter at all.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Harman, how strong is the case that's being built against the president?

JANE HARMAN, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-CALIF.: Well, I'm not in the room either, but to be clear, these are depositions, they're not hearings. There are various people were talking under oath. Republicans and Democrats are in the room. The questions are primarily being asked by counsel. But Republicans and Democrats had equal time to ask questions.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: OK. But enough about the process, what do you think of the substance?

HARMAN: So, you know, the substance leaks out, and it's in the press, but I think it hasn't been a good week for the president.

Two good things happened. One is, I think sort of kind of good week, he backed off on the China tariffs. That's a big deal because the economy was about to -- it seems to me soft into a point that it really hurt him. But the other sort of kind of big deal is our troops are moving to Iraq, they are not leaving the area. So, there will be some counter-ISIS movement.

That does not mean I think his Syria decision made any sense. I don't think so. I agree with Mitch McConnell.

WALLACE: Maybe the biggest surprise in my interview with Mick Mulvaney is he doesn't seem to have known about the revelations this week about Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden finally answered questions about his business dealings in Ukraine. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

INTERVIEWER: If your last name wasn't Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?

HUNTER BIDEN, SON OF JOE BIDEN: I don't know, I don't know. Probably not. I don't think that there's a lot of things that wouldn't have happened in my life that if my last name wasn't Biden.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But, Kim, we also learned that one of those State Department officials who testified before the House impeachment investigation this week was so disturbed in 2015 when Hunter Biden started working for this Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, and that -- at least the appearance if nothing else, at least the appearance that it seemed to be self-dealing, that he went to the vice president himself, because Biden, of course, was then Vice President, and said this really looks bad and he was turned away.

How big a deal?

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Yes, I mean, I think it is a big deal. It surprised no one though because prior to the press deciding that this was a whole issue that we're not allowed to talk about, Joe Biden did nothing wrong, they were writing all the stories about this, and quoting former officials who worked for Joe Biden saying they were uneasy with the situation. And they didn't like that it was happening.

And so -- I mean, the issue here to me has always been -- people like to use the word ""corrupt"", the issue was always been the appearance question, right? It's the question of whether or not Hunter Biden was profiting off of his father's position. You don't really need to go much further than that.

And it is hurting Joe Biden out there with primary voters.

WALLACE: Let's pick up on that one because the president who doesn't like the back down did back down overnight and say, well, OK, I'm not going to hold the summit next June, the G7 summit in Doral, his own resort -- there was really a lot of squealing about it from Republicans and Democrats who said it appeared to be this kind of self-dealing, do you think one of the reasons that he may have done it is because it would certainly -- it seemed to blunt his case against Joe Biden?

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it did. I think the cancellation is a tiny step in the right direction. But again, this is so blatant and over-the-top self-dealing on the part of the president, putting his self interest, or as Mick Mulvaney said to you, his history as a man in the hospitality business, about the national interest. I think that then speaks to behold Ukrainian deal.

But on a larger point, I think it's one of the campaign promises that he broke. He said he was going to divest himself of all business interests. So this cancellation is a step in the right direction, but think for a second about the idea that he has no problem appointing Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, as some kind of emissary to the Middle East and he's dealing with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, a man who's killed journalists and making excuses. I think this is -- again, this is this is not normal.

WALLACE: That's just a decision, and as Mick Mulvaney said about Rudy Giuliani, the president gets to decide who he wants to do his business. That's just the policy issue.

WILLIAMS: I think that -- again, you're putting your family in positions of critical policy. So, it's apart from the normal operation of foreign policy in the country. It's like the shadow foreign policy that was run by Giuliani.

But again, to my mind, you look at Doral -- the reason I say it's part of a pattern, Chris, is Doral was a struggling property, here is the president saying, here, I'm going to help my own business and forever branded as the prestigious pot because of the G7 was held there.

WALLACE: Kim?

STRASSEL: Well, look, this is a very complicated subject. I'm glad that he decided not to do it because I do think it blunts his message about the appearance of conflict with Hunter Biden. There is a very complicated discussion to be had about whether or not Donald Trump's business empire has actually profited from his business (ph) or more likely, as much of the reporting has shown, he's probably taken a hit. I mean, there's good evidence that his bookings are down out a lot of his places and some --

WALLACE: Nobody made him run for president.

STRASSEL: No, no, I'm not saying -- I mean, I'm just saying I'm not like arguing, oh, poor president. I'm just saying, look at the numbers. You can't just run around and say, oh, you know, the president is profiting off of his presidency, like I think you just have to look at the facts. Yes.

WALLACE: But, Kim, it's about profit.

STRASSEL: Look at the facts.

WALLACE: The emoluments clause says you can't take any compensation from a foreign government.

STRASSEL: Well, we have never had a discussion in the court system about what the emoluments clause actually (INAUDIBLE).

WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying, that's what it says.

WALLACE: Well, there are actually a few court cases right now.

HARMAN: We're having it now.

WALLACE: So, we'll see.

All right, we've got to --

STRASSEL: We're going to find out.

WALLACE: Folks, I've got to save time for you for the next panel.

We have to take a break here. Up next, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins us here in Washington after a debate that has some Democrats saying he can compete with Joe Biden as the centrist voice of the party.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Mayor Pete Buttigieg hot off the debate stage, where he went toe to toe with his Democratic rivals.

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-IND., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask him, what's his path to the nomination.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Pete Buttigieg is trying to get back into the top tier of 2020 Democratic candidates. And a strong performance in this week's debate paid off with more than $1 million in campaign contributions in the first 24 hours after the debate.

Joining us now is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

And, Mayor, welcome back.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: Let's start with your latest poll numbers. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys, you're in fourth place nationally at 5.8 percent, fourth in Iowa with 13 percent, and fourth in New Hampshire at 8.7 percent. As a candidate from the Midwest, and also looking at those numbers, don't you have to finish in the top at least two or three in Iowa or you're done?

BUTTIGIEG: I think it's certainly the case that a strong performance in Iowa is going to be critical to us winning the nomination. And that's what we're building toward. We've got a terrific ground game there, over 22, I believe, field offices now and 100 organizers, and I think a message that's really connecting with Iowans. You know, Democrats there, first and foremost, of course, want to know that we can defeat and replace President Trump. Also want to know how the policies we're putting forward are going to affect their lives. And whether it's Medicare for all who want it or the vision we're putting forward on any of a number of issues, we find that it's resonating.

But even now there are so many Iowans who maybe have it narrowed down to a top three or so but are taking their time, evaluating their choices. And we've got our work cut out for us to close the deal between now and the caucus.

WALLACE: You have stalled to some degree in the polls, as we just pointed out, at least nationally, ever since that terrible police shooting in South Bend, Indiana, this summer. And folks noticed a more aggressive performance by you in this last debate, taking on Elizabeth Warren on Medicare for all, Tulsi Gabbard on troops in Syria, and Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks.

Take a look at you.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BUTTIGIEG: Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. Respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong.

I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Was that a conscious effort to jumpstart your campaign?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, these are also topics I'm very passionate about. When it comes to what is being done to not just the Middle East, for example, but to American credibility. The fact that right now people who put their lives on the line, trusting that the United States would have their back, and are now betrayed, the fact that U.S. troops in the field feel that their honor has been stolen from them by their commander in chief, how can you not be fired up about something like that? And this is the season for us to lay out what we care about, what we're passionate about, and what's different among each of the candidates. And I want to make sure there's no question in any voter's mind how their life would be different under my presidency than if any of the others were to be elected.

WALLACE: Well, one of the distinctions you drew sharply is you said that 2021, if a Democrat is elected president, the -- the country can make historic gains on health care and immigration and guns, but not, you said, if they push too far and promise too much.

Do you think that some of the solutions that are being offered, whether it's on climate change, Medicare for all, by Senators Warren and Sanders, are too drastic?

BUTTIGIEG: I think that we have a chance to build an American majority around bold action. But it is the case that we could wreck that majority through purity tests. Look, take the example of this Medicare question. I'm proposing Medicare for all who want it. It means we create a version of Medicare, everybody can get access to it, and if you get -- if you want to keep your private plan, we're OK with that. I think that's a better policy than kicking people off of their plan.

But I also think that it's something that more Americans can get behind. And when you think about the condition our country's going to be in when this presidency comes to an end, one way or the other, when you think about how torn apart by politics we're going to be, how polarized and divided this country is, this, to me, is not a political question, it's a question of governing. The good news is, we can govern in a very bold and forward-leading direction, but we've got to make sure we do it in a way that moves toward unifying rather than further polarizing the American people.

WALLACE: Not surprisingly, the left is firing back at you when Elizabeth Warren said that she will not participate in big fundraisers, even if she is the Democratic nominee against Donald Trump in -- next fall. You said this, let's put it on the screen, we are not going to beat him -- Trump -- with pocket change. Here's how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded. Small dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttigieg insults here as pocket change, out fundraised him by millions. Our nation's leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it.

So, what do you have to say to AOC?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, you don't go from mayor of South Bend to a competitive presidential candidate without knowing a thing or two about grassroots campaigning. My campaign is fueled by the contributions of almost 600,000 individual donors. And most of those are small contributions. What I'm saying is that we can't go into this fight against Donald Trump with one hand tied behind our back.

Look, the president of the United States and his allies just raised $125 million. They will pull out all of the stops to stay in power. And I think we have a responsibility to the country to make sure that we go into this fight, as Democrats, with everything that we've got, and not unilaterally disarming.

We indeed need to end the era of big money politics. That's why campaign finance reform is so important. And it will never happen as long as the folks currently in charge stay there.

WALLACE: The last time you and I talked was in August and I pointed out to you -- perhaps not too charitably -- that you were at zero percent in the polls among African-Americans. There's a new poll out in the last few days. You're now at two percent support among African-Americans.

When we last talked, you -- you -- you described a big outreach to minority communities, the African-American community. Why isn't it working?

BUTTIGIEG: Look, for me this isn't about the polls, this is about making sure that –

WALLACE: Well, in the end, it is about the polls.

BUTTIGIEG: But in order to do well, you need to deserve to do well. And we're focusing on the substance of what I have to offer. Voters want to know how their lives will be different. And in the case of African-American voters, they want to know what my agenda is for black Americans.

We're putting forward the most comprehensive plan of any candidate to tackle systemic racism in this country. It's everything from empowering black entrepreneurs and fueling business development, to making sure we deal with discrimination in housing and in health, to cutting incarceration in this country by 50 percent because we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately harms African-Americans. We need to continue making that case. It's extremely well-received whenever I have a chance to offer it up, but there are a lot of voters who are still sizing up their options, who need to feel like they know you. And our job is to do that in a short amount of time.

WALLACE: I want to press down on this just a little bit because you talk about needing to deserve it and voters trying to understand who you are.

You were supposed to attend a big fundraiser in Chicago on Friday. And one of the hosts was the same city attorney who worked very hard to block release of this video of police shooting Laquan McDonald. The lawyer backed out of -- of the fundraiser. He also donated $5,600 to your campaign. Particularly at a time when African-Americans are trying to get to know you, isn't that the kind of mistake, Mayor, that you can't afford to make?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, this came to my attention in the morning and within an hour it had been taken care of. Look, the situation there and justice and transparency for Laquan McDonald is much more important to me than a campaign contribution. And we did the right thing as soon as it came to my attention.

WALLACE: Can you understand where people would say, well, this is a guy who wants our vote but he was going to take -- was taking money, and was attending a fundraiser being held by this city attorney?

BUTTIGIEG: And then we took care of it.

Look, I think the biggest question on voter's minds is, how is my life going to be different, especially when that sun comes up, that first day after Donald Trump is president. And the agenda that I'm putting forward, the -- the issues that I want to tackle, I think will speak to black voters and to all voters who are seeking a better life in this country and seeking to turn the page from the chaos and the corruption that we're living under right now.

WALLACE: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you. Safe travels on the campaign trail, sir.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: When we come back, Turkey agrees to a temporary ceasefire in Syria. We'll ask our Sunday group what it means for U.S. interests in the Middle East.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The Kurds are very happy./ Turkey is very happy. The United States is very happy. And, you know what, civilization is very happy. It's a great thing for civilization.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump with an optimistic assessment of the cease-fire brokered by Vice President Pence this week in Turkey.

And we're back now with the panel.

Congresswoman Harman, what you think of the deal that the U.S. made with Turkey?

HARMAN: I think, sadly, Pence and his advisors were scrambling on the plane to come up with some kind of announcement that would make sense. And I salute Pence for trying. However, I don't think he succeeded. I think a deal under these circumstances was impossible. And where we are now is the ceasefire is not holding, the Kurds, our allies, who lost 11,000 people on the battlefield, we lost six, are being massacred. There is now a vacuum being filled by ISIS, by Syria, the Syrian government, and by Russia.

And, guess what, Israel, our -- our deepest ally in the region, is now surrounded by Iran on the Syrian border, by Iran making the missiles from Libya -- from Lebanon smarter on the Lebanese border and by Iran and Tehran. And this is creating an existential threat and leading to really dangerous circumstances.

And, finally, ISIS is regrouping and the ISIS fighters that are regrouping are from Europe and they will get through the Turkish border and attack in Europe.

WALLACE: Congressman Chaffetz, even a lot of staunch Trump supporter's inside the Republican Party have real problems with the agreement and -- and the actions by the president in northern Syria.

Your thoughts?

JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: I think the agreement was good, although temporary. We'll see how it stands above and beyond the last few days.

But the president did the right thing. He did exactly what he was campaigning on doing. I believe if you -- if you can't go and fight and win the war, then you bring them home. And, you know what, if the Senate and the House feel so strongly, then pass a piece of legislation. Don't just do some little slap on the hand and right an op-ed and say, oh, tisk, tisk, Mr. President.

WALLACE: You -- you're talking about Mitch McConnell?

CHAFFETZ: Yes. I'm saying that they should actually pass a war powers authorization and do that. Put on your big boy pants and do that.

But the president's doing the right thing.

WALLACE: And then there was the meeting on Syria that was held at the White House this week. Here's the indelible picture of it. It ended with President Trump calling Speaker Pelosi, depending on the account you heard, either a third rate or a third grade politician, not a complement in either case, and Pelosi getting up, as you see here, and walking out.

Here's what they said afterwards.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: That crazy Nancy. She is crazy.

PELOSI: I pray for the president all the time, and I tell them that. I pray for his safety and that of his family. The -- now we have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Juan, not only can't they legislate in Congress anymore, they've apparently can't even stand to be in each other's presence.

WILLIAMS: No, I mean, it's -- to me what's key here is that I think you see from the House vote that even Republicans were shocked out of their silence in -- in responding to President Trump by his decision.

WALLACE: You think you'd vote against the president's Syria policy?

WILLIAMS: I think you said it earlier, 129 Republicans voted with the Democratic majority. So it clearly showed there is bipartisan outrage at allowing our allies, the Kurds, to be slaughtered by the Turks in this way.

With response -- in response to your question about the meeting, I think that Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, speaker of the House, the minority leader in the Senate, were strong enough to confront the president in the meeting, to get in his face and say, this is the wrong policy. And the president responded with elementary school, you know, schoolyard bullying, third rate politician. Nancy Pelosi is no third rate politician by anybody's measure.

But I think the key here is the policy, Chris, the policy is the problem. And to be clear, and I think this is in response that Congressman Chaffetz point, this is not about bringing troops home. There are only about 150 troops involved. The president just sent 2,000 to Saudi Arabia. So, I mean, to me, this is about the president pulling our influence out of there, allowing our allies to be slaughtered, and compromising America's integrity and promise to our allies. It's a foreign policy quagmire.

WALLACE: Kim, I wanted you to address a different aspect of that, which is that both sides talk about being able to walk and chew gum at the same time, trying to get some things done. The one thing they particularly talk about is passing the USMCA, the U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Can they get anything done between the impeachment investigation, the bitterness from that, and the fact that we're -- you could say we're all already in a full-fledged campaign. Certainly by the end of the year we're in a full-fledged campaign.

STRASSEL: Right. I mean whatever happened in that meeting and the dueling narratives, it almost doesn't matter because what it exposes is what you just said, is that when Democrats decided they were going to go forward with this impeachment inquiry, it created a new dynamic in Washington. And this is one of the consequences of it.

I do not see how anyone gets anything done while they're in the middle of - - I mean, think of it from the Trump White House perspective. They're trying to remove him from office. And that just does make it a very difficult circumstance in which he -- then sit down, shake hands, play nice.

I agree, everyone would want there to be progress and I think that the best thing the Trump White House could do would be, to fact, to kind of rise above it and talk about governing and talk about what they've accomplished and what they want to accomplish. But I'm not quite sure that is going to be the dynamic going forward.

HARMAN: Government funding --

WALLACE: Congresswoman, I've got less than a minute left.

Does impeachment and politics poison everything? Does anything get done in Washington between now and November 2020?

HARMAN: Well, that was the history of the Clinton impeachment, everything stopped. But government funding runs out on November 21st, in the middle of whatever it is that we're going to see. And I think it would be tragic if, once again, we put federal workers and -- and the economy through that nightmare. So the Congress has to pass the budget bills. There has to be progress. And I think the leadership of Congress somehow will find a way forward.

WALLACE: So the most they can do is keep the government running?

HARMAN: Keep the government running. Right.

WALLACE: All right.

Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" trying to solve the 82-year-old mystery, what happened to Amelia Earhart?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: It is one of the enduring mysteries of the 20th and now the 21st century, but a renowned explorer is determined to solve it.

Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERT BALLARD, DEEP-SEA EXPLORER: She said, I can do anything, and then went out and did it.

WALLACE (voice over): Robert Ballard is talking about America Earhart, the world-famous aviator, who's this mysterious disappearance 82 years ago has only added to her legend.

In August, Ballard led an expedition to find some trace of Earhart or her plane. It's the subject of a new ""National Geographic"" documentary.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's shedding new light on one of the world's most captivating people.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In ship number six, it's the world-famous Amelia Earhart.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) is good to go.

BALLARD: It exists. It's not the Loch Ness Monster. It's not Bigfoot. That plane exists, which means you can find it.

WALLACE: Earhart was on an around the world trip in 1937 when her plane vanished in the Pacific.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For years she pushed the boundaries of what was humanly possible, shattering a dozen records in the air, while breaking barriers for women on the ground.

WALLACE: The leading theory is Earhart ran out of gas near a tiny atoll called Nikumaroro. And that's where Ballard took his ship, the Nautilus, spending two weeks searching the coral reef with surface vessels, drones, and remote underwater vehicles.

BALLARD: It's just hours and hours and hours and hours searching at night with a flashlight. You never know.

WALLACE: Thirty-four years ago, Ballard led another expedition and shocked the world by discovering Titanic.

WALLACE (on camera): How does this search compare to searching for and finding Titanic?

BALLARD: This one's tougher. A lot tougher.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard feels a kinship with Earhart. They're both Kansans. But there's more.

BALLARD: I always have people say, you're nuts. You can't do it. And then I go do it.

WALLACE (on camera): And is there some Amelia Earhart in that too?

BALLARD: You bet there's a lot of Amelia Earhart in the sky.

WALLACE (voice over): For two weeks Ballard and his team searched the area, on land in case Earhart survived a crash, and underwater.

BALLARD: Whoa. Whoa, that looks like coral, but it's got a hole.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's got a perfect hole. Want to simple it.

BALLARD: Yes, just flip it over.

We pounded the area. This was a full court press with everything we had.

WALLACE (on camera): And, in the end, what did you find?

BALLARD: We didn't find the plane.

WALLACE: How big a disappointment?

BALLARD: Well, you know, I know where it isn't.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard says that's science. You go down dark alleys, then don't go down them again. Now he plans another expedition in two years using new technology to another site nearby.

BALLARD: I love the toys as much as I -- I love the hunt.

WALLACE (on camera): And you get to do both here.

BALLARD: Absolutely. I love developing the technology, going out and using it, and then coming home and sharing the story.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: The special exhibition, ""Amelia,"" premieres tonight on the National Geographic Channel.

Time now for one final note.

We have declared ourselves the unofficial Sunday show of the Washington Nationals. This week they clinched the National League championship in a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, setting up the National's first trip to the World Series. They'll play the Houston Astros in game one of the series Tuesday night right here on Fox.

And someone is so excited that he showed up here today, Teddy Roosevelt, one of the raising (ph) presidents from Nats park has dropped by and Teddy has delegated me to say, go Nats!

WILLIAMS: Go Nats!

CHAFFETZ: Go Nationals!

WALLACE: Teddy, here you go. Don't hold me hanging.

Oh, my God.

WILLIAMS: Go Teddy!

WALLACE: And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" plan.

The Massachusetts Democrat and White House candidate said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ""What I see … is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of 'Medicare-for-all,' and specifically how we pay for it.""

Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ""Medicare-for-all"" plans at $32-34 trillion.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

She added about the universal health insurance plan: ""This is something I’ve been working on for months and months, and it’s got just a little more work until it’s finished.""

Warren, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary frontrunner, came under attack from her 2020 White House rivals at Tuesday night’s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to pay for her proposal.

POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE

On Sunday at the town hall, she reiterated her promise that the financial burden of ""Medicare-for-all"" wouldn’t be on everyday Americans: ""I will not sign a bill into law that does not reduce the cost of health care for middle-class families.""

After the town hall, she added: ""The whole plan will be out; you’ll be able to look at it.""

""It's mystifying that for someone who has put having a plan for everything at the center of her pitch to voters, Senator Warren has decided to release a health care plan only after enduring immense public pressure for refusing to do so,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said later. ""We hope her plan will be straight with the American people about how much middle-class taxes will go up to pay for the $30+ trillion it will take to fund"" the plan, he added.

The intraparty battle over implementing ""Medicare-for-all"" versus strengthening the nation’s health-care law – known as the Affordable Care Act – has been a leading and divisive issue in the race for the presidential nomination.

""Every single person who is running for president of the United States on the Democratic side right now knows that families are getting crushed by the cost of health care,"" Warren said during the town hall. ""They also know that the cheapest possible way to make sure that everyone gets the health care they need is 'Medicare-for-all,' and that's why I support 'Medicare-for-all.'""

The Cons… [+2883 chars]",The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider whether an Obama-era financial watchdog --- created in part by Democratic 2020 frontrunner Elizabeth Warren in 2010 to police Wall Street in the aftermath of the Great Recession — is constitutional.,2019-10-19,Fox News,Supreme Court to decide if Obama-era Wall Street watchdog agency is constitutional,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-constitution-obama-watchdog-elizabeth-warren-consumer-financial-protection-bureau,"The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider whether an Obama-era financial watchdog --- created in part by Democratic 2020 frontrunner Elizabeth Warren in 2010 to police Wall Street in the aftermath of the Great Recession — is constitutional.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the U.S. government, responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. It was created by Congress in 2010 to be an autonomous entity, structured so each director serves a five-year term and can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

MICHAEL MOORE ENDORSES BERNIE SANDERS: 'HE ISN'T AFRAID TO SAY CAPITALISM IS THE PROBLEM'

Warren, D-Mass., touted on the campaign trail that the bureau returned $12 billion to consumers during the Obama administration, The Washington Post reported. She uses the figure to push a presidential platform based on attacking corporate greed and increasing taxes on wealthy Americans.

“Big banks and their Republican allies have been trying to kill the CFPB for years, and the Trump administration is hoping the right-wing, pro-corporate Supreme Court will help. I’ve got news for them: Like it or not, the CFPB is constitutional,” Warren said on Twitter.

An attorney for the Trump administration told the Supreme Court in a brief last month that even the bureau’s current director, Kathleen Kraninger, who was sworn in in 2018, believes the structure of the CFPB violates the separation of powers clause of the Constitution given its director cannot be fired by the president without sufficient cause.

Critics of the bureau say the Constitution gives the president the power to remove top-ranking executive branch officials for any reason or none at all. They say the founders were wary of power being entrusted to any one individual who had not been elected into office, the Washington Times reported.

The Supreme Court “has consistently recognized that the Constitution empowers the president to keep federal officers accountable by removing them from office,” Washington lawyer Kannon K. Shanmugam wrote in the brief, according to The Washington Post.

“While in limited circumstances the court has upheld the constitutionality of certain multi-member ‘independent’ agencies ... the court has never upheld the constitutionality of an independent agency that exercises significant executive authority and is headed by a single person.”

Republicans and banking executives have opposed the bureau since its inception, arguing it often pushing legal margins to slap unnecessary penalties on financial intuitions. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney once described the bureau as “a joke” and supported legislation to disband it, the Post reported.

Lower court ruling on the constitutionality of the bureau have been conflicting. A three-judge panel on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, which included then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh before he became a Supreme Court Justice, ruled the CFPB was unconstitutional. The entire court later overturned the decision, the Times reported."

Bernie Sanders of Vermont proudly calls himself a democratic socialist. But fellow Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – who holds many similar extreme-leftist positions – claims she’s really a capitalist.

That’s a claim that would add a few feet to Pinocchio’s nose.

Warren can call herself anything she wants. She falsely called herself a Native American for years and finally had to apologize for that instance of mislabeling. But if truth in packaging laws applied to politicians, Warren would have to admit she’s no more a capitalist than she is a Native American.

CHARLES PAYNE: ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS TO BREAK APART AN ECONOMY THAT'S WORKING

With her long record of promoting socialist causes and her calls for massive new job-killing government regulations and huge tax increases – on income, wealth, and whatever she can think of to take money from hard-working individuals and businesses – Warren is as much of a socialist as Sanders.

While their views aren’t are identical, the true ideological colors of Comrade Bernie and Comrade Elizabeth are both shades of red.

In the wake of Sanders’ recent heart attack, Warren appears better positioned than ever to become the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nominee.

Real Clear Politics’ average of recent presidential surveys shows Warren is now polling eight percentage points higher than Sanders. And in two national surveys – one by The Economist and another by Quinnipiac – Warren is polling higher than the longstanding front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.

Although Biden has been considered a lock to win the nomination by some analysts for months, it seems unlikely he will be able to compete with a far-left challenger like Warren or Sanders once the race inevitably narrows.

Although Biden is unquestionably a progressive whose policies would cause substantial damage to the U.S., he’s not a radical who wants to dynamite the capitalist system that has made America the most prosperous and powerful nation on the planet. But that’s exactly what Warren and Sanders want to do.

It doesn’t help that Biden’s TV debate performances have made the former vice president look more than a little confused. At times, it appears Biden isn’t sure where he is or what year it is – never mind what the candidates are debating.

Warren is a different story entirely. Her debate performances have been sharp and, at times, impressive – though she sometimes sounds like a nagging schoolteacher berating her young students.

Why, exactly, hasn’t Warren been labeled a “socialist”? The biggest – and perhaps the only – reason is that she and others in her party and the left-leaning media continue to insist she isn’t one, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary.

For example, in an Oct. 13 interview with ABC News’s “This Week,” Sanders said: “There are differences between Elizabeth and myself. Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Like many of the things oozing from Comrade Bernie’s mouth, this, too, is false. Warren is a socialist through and through and her dangerous, destructive policy plans would – like all socialist proposals – cause substantial harm to America’s economy and society, hurting everyone, including the most impoverished.

Warren understands that if she says she’s a socialist, she’ll lose support from moderate voters whose support she would need in the general election to defeat President Trump. So she pretends she’s not what she really is.

Here are just some of Warren’s many frightening socialist plans for the United States:

Warren has endorsed the “Just Society” proposal of socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. This radical idea would – among other things – redefine poverty in the United States so that potentially tens of millions of additional Americans will be pushed onto social welfare programs like Medicaid. A “Just Society” would also make it illegal to deny illegal immigrants and those who have been convicted of crimes access to welfare programs.

Warren has proposed what she calls The Accountable Capitalism Act. This would force every corporation in America with $1 billion or more in annual revenue to obtain a federal charter from a new regulatory agency. The legislation would require that at least 40 percent of corporate board member be elected by workers, and impose costly new bureaucratic regulations on companies. This would likely cause a mass exodus of the most important businesses from the U.S. – stunting economic growth, sending unemployment skyrocketing, and increasing the national debt

Warren has also proposed imposing a single-payer health care system. This would outlaw most forms of private health insurance and force the more than 140 million Americans now enrolled in private insurance plans onto government-managed health plans – all at a cost of $32 trillion over 10 years. Single-payer models elsewhere in the world require very high taxes and have led to rationing of health care and long wait times. This rationing increases unnecessary pain and suffering for millions of people and in the most extreme cases can lead to some patient deaths.

Warren also wants to spend $500 billion over 10 years to build millions of new housing units, and trillions of dollars to cancel college student loan debt for 42 million Americans. She would also “give every American the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year public college without paying a dime in tuition or fees.”

Warren, like Sanders, was one of the original cosponsors of Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. This is the most radical, dangerous, environmentally destructive proposal in modern American history. The Green New Deal would destroy millions of jobs by eliminating most forms of fossil fuel generation and use, including that gasoline-powered vehicle you drive to work every day. It would also create a new system of publicly-owned banks, basic income programs, a federal jobs guarantee, massive new green housing mandates, a universal health food program, and countless new “social justice” programs.

These proposals – and the incredibly high tax increases needed to fund them – would push the U.S. closer than ever to full-blown Marxism, and they are without any doubt in line with socialist principles. This is why self-described socialists like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have embraced or even proposed the vast majority of them.

With Halloween just around the corner, millions of children will be dressing up for one night pretending to be all sorts of characters. Warren has stopped pretending to be a Native American, but pretends every day to be a capitalist – while she knows very well that she’s a socialist through and through.

For the sake of our country and the American people, let’s hope voters see through Warren’s masquerade.

Third-quarter filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show Biden has just $9 million in cash on hand, less than half of what both of his top competitors for the 2020 Democratic nomination -- Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- reported, according to The Hill.

DONNA BRAZILE: BIDEN CAMPAIGN 'NEEDS TO BE CONCERNED' ABOUT CASH WOES

“I hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,” a campaign fundraising email for Biden said. “If we don’t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.”

Less cash on hand means the campaign will struggle to respond to “twists and turns of this race — and with Donald Trump constantly pushing his false smear campaign against Joe, that’s a HUGE problem,” the letter says.

The letter closes with an appeal, according to The Hill.

“We can’t afford to fall behind, so I’m asking you to step up now and make a donation to fuel our campaign.""

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso said Biden's cash flow could dry up ""as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.""

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

The 76-year-old former vice president started off as a solid frontrunner in the polls, but more recent surveys have shown Warren either catching up or surpassing him.

All told, the Ukraine company paid $3.4 million to Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, a company headed by Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer, The National Review reported.

Between April 2014 and November 2015, Biden and Archer each received monthly payments of $83,333 for “consulting services.""

HUNTER BIDEN'S QUESTIONABLE PAST AND BUSINESS DEALINGS COULD UNDO DAD'S BID FOR WHITE HOUSE

Burisma Holdings founder Mykola Zlochevsky hired the son of former Vice President Joe Biden to ""protect"" the company in the face of prosecution, the Review reported.

Zlochevsky faced investigation in Ukraine and was initially cleared of wrongdoing for tax violations, money laundering and corruption. But earlier this month Ukrainian Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka said 15 cases involving Zlochevsky would be reviewed, according to The National Review.

Biden’s work with the company has come under scrutiny after President Trump alleged that Joe Biden inappropriately used his diplomatic influence in Ukraine to help his son.

No evidence of wrongdoing has been found and both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden deny the allegations. Hunter Biden has since pledged to avoid business deals with foreign entities if his father becomes president.

A July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which Trump asked his counterpart to investigate the Bidens -- led the Democrat-controlled House to start the Trump impeachment inquiry earlier this month.

Moore also endorsed Sanders for president in 2016, saying at the time that he first backed Sanders when he was running for Congress in 1990.

“I’ve been a supporter of his ever since, and he’s never given me reason to not continue that support,” Moore wrote at the time.

Sanders addressed his recent health problems during Tuesday night’s debate in Ohio.

“I’m healthy. I’m feeling great,"" he told the audience. ""We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.”

The rally will be held near the country’s largest public housing development and a power plant, the Huffington Post reported, and Sanders plans to speak about affordable housing and Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal.

The rally is meant as a reset after his heart attack and his lagging poll numbers behind surging progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass."

""It is not about only coverage, it's about cost,"" he told ABC News' ""This Week."" ""The fact is, when President Obama did the [Affordable Care Act], it was to be built upon -- not to be pulled out and start all over again. This was a 100-year effort. That’s what’s insane about this process.

""Your next step should be, early buy-in to Medicare for early retirees and then take on the fact that President Trump’s budget has the largest cut in Medicare ever,"" Emanuel continued.

Emanuel's comments came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., came out against a ""Medicare-for-all"" system last month and cautioned 2020 presidential candidates against embracing the idea.

“We think the right path is the Affordable Care Act,"" Pelosi said on CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" ""and that is a path to health care for all Americans.""

Pelosi said when Democrats seize control of the presidency again, they can deliver on their more ambitious health-care promises.

""I always say to people, when we win, we can put everything on the table and see what it means in terms of benefits for the consumer, cost to them, and costs to business, to corporate America, which is paying a lot of their price, as well as cost to the federal government and local government,"" she said.

Thus far, Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have favored a public system seeking to abolish private insurance, while other candidates such as Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg have expressed a desire to keep private options available.

Last month, support for ""Medicare-for-all"" increased in Congress to include a majority of House Democrats.

Ocasio-Cortez, who has quickly become one of the most prominent left-wing House lawmakers since taking office in January, backed Sanders formally at the rally in Long Island City. She credited Sanders with having inspired her to embark on her own long-shot political bid, in which she ousted longtime Rep. Joe Crowley last year.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

""It wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,” she said.

In her remarks, she talked about her own personal story of growing up in New York and painted a grim picture of America, telling the crowd: “We are all always, it feels like, one accident from everything falling apart and we have to change the fundamental logic of a system and a politics that puts corp profit ahead of all human and planetary costs.”

But she said Sanders had spent decades for fighting for those things to make life for her better, such as the Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP), universal health care, and student debt forgiveness.

“Bernie Sanders did not do these things because they were popular and that’s what we need to remember,” she said. “No one wanted to question this system and in 2016 he fundamentally changed politics in America.”

MICHAEL MOORE ENDORSES BERNIE SANDERS: 'HE ISN'T AFRAID TO SAY CAPITALISM IS THE PROBLEM'

“We right now have one of the best Democratic presidential primary fields in a generation and much of that is thanks to the work that Bernie Sanders has done throughout his entire life,” she said.

The endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, along with other members of The Squad, -- the progressive group of freshman lawmakers -- marks a needed win for Sanders during a difficult few weeks for his campaign.

He has found himself trailing behind both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in a number of polls, and has been recovering from surgery after a heart attack. The latter has raised questions about his stamina for not only the grueling presidential race, but also at least a term in the White House.

In his remarks on Saturday, Sanders sought to quash doubts about whether he could continue, stressing his commitment to continuing his “political revolution”

“I am more than ready to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and their apologists. I am more ready than ever to help create a gov based on the principles of justice, economic justice, racial justice, social justice and environmental justice,” he said.

Kennedy to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to mock President Trump's recent, casually worded missive to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but the Twitter mockery quickly blew back in Clinton's face, with commentators across the political spectrum suggesting the former secretary of state shouldn't relish so openly in Twitter trolling.

What's more, users quickly noted that Clinton's team had lifted the letter, without attribution, from a segment on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" that aired this past Wednesday night.

The kerfuffle came as Clinton's feud with Tulsi Gabbard has prompted speculation that she might enter the presidential race — and a dare from Gabbard to do just that.

""Dear Premier Kruschev,"" the mock letter ""from the archives"" during the Cuban Missile Crisis began, ""Don't be a d--k, ok? Get your missiles out of Cuba. ... Give you a jingle later. Hugs.""

In his Oct. 9 letter to Erdoğan, first obtained by the Fox Business Network's Trish Regan, Trump adopted a similarly familiar tone.

""Let's work out a good deal!"" Trump began. ""You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy - and I will. I've already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson."" Brunson was held as a prisoner in Turkey for two years before the Trump administration secured his release.

GABBARD REVEALS WHY CLINTON'S COMING AFTER HER

Trump continued: ""Don't let the world down. ... History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool. I will call you later.""

Sources close to Erdoğan told the BBC Thursday that the Turkish strongman ""thoroughly rejected"" the letter. Erdoğan reportedly took the letter warning against being a ""fool"" and tossed it ""in the bin,"" the sources said.

But Clinton's jab itself inspired a slew of mockery — including a post that highlighted Clinton's October 2016 tweet, featuring a photo of herself as a little girl with the caption: ""Happy birthday to this future president.""

The Washington Examiner's Jerry Dunleavy flagged that the letter had appeared on Jimmy Kimmel's show. The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler remarked dryly, ""Sometimes silence is golden.""

Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser Lara Trump earlier this month welcomed a possible Clinton presidential run in 2020, saying she was confident the president would defeat Clinton again.

""First of all, I just want to double down on the president and say if Hillary Clinton would like round two with Donald Trump, please let's do that,"" the wife of the president's son Eric Trump said on ""Hannity.""

""I would love to see a 'round two' between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton because I think we all remember, Sean, not too long ago, all the media said that she was going to be the next president. We see Donald Trump in the White House now.""

Clinton herself had sparked a wave of speculation about a possible run with a pointed Oct. 8 tweet.

* A new Suffolk/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats shows a competitive presidential nominating contest, with Joe Biden narrowly leading Elizabeth Warren, 18% to 17%, with Pete Buttigieg not far behind with 13%. Bernie Sanders slipped to fourth in this poll, with 9% support.

* Also of interest, Amy Klobuchar was at 3% in the poll – she’s tied for fifth place – which I think will help move the Minnesota Democrat closer to qualifying for next month’s presidential primary debate.

* Speaking of Minnesota, a new Star Tribune poll found Donald Trump trailing each of the top Democratic contenders in 2020 match-ups.

* The day after acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said, “Get over it” after acknowledging the White House’s quid-pro-quo scheme with Ukraine, Trump’s re-election campaign began selling t-shirts with the same phrase.

* Julian Castro’s presidential campaign announced this morning that the former House secretary will end his presidential bid without an additional $800,000 in donations over the next 10 days. Of course, even if the Texas Democrat gets the money, he’s still not yet close to meeting the polling threshold for next month’s primary debate.

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

We begin with breaking news. President Trump announced by tweet last night he's backing off his controversial decision to hold the G7 Summit next year at his own resort. He says the search will now begin for a new site.

But the president is still under fire even from a growing number of Republicans. GOP congressmen voted by more than 2-1 against his policy in Syria. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the president at a political quid pro quo from USA to Ukraine. Mulvaney later denied he said it, and more damaging testimony in the House impeachment investigation.

In a moment we will talk with the president chief of staff who just flinched when I said that.

But, first, let's bring in Kevin Corke with the latest from the White House -- Kevin.

KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, a precarious pause perhaps describes the tenuous nature of the circumstance on the ground in Syria as sporadic skirmishes continue to speckle the region, even as we learn much more about the U.S. strategy for American forces there.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARK ESPER, DEFENSE SECRETARY: The current game plan is for those forces to reposition into western Iraq, the ones coming out, right? That original 1,000. And then two missions -- one is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission.

Back in Washington, the impeachment drumbeat reached a fevered pitch as House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff interviewed a cascade of Trump administration officials but Ukraine and a possible quid pro quo tying USA aid to cooperation with a probe into the Biden's business dealings.

Incredibly, the gulf between House Democrats and the White House seem to grow, when Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stormed out of a White House meeting, accusing the president of having a meltdown over a bipartisan House vote rebuking his pullout in Syria. All as the president late Saturday rescinded his decision to host next year's G7 Summit at his resort in Miami, tweeting: Based on both media and Democrat crazed and irrational hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral Miami -- a reversal that came after withering criticism and accusations of self- dealing.

Can you at least understand and acknowledge that the -- just the appearance of impropriety makes us wince inducing and maybe this is something you maybe want to reconsider?

MULVANEY: He got over that a long time ago. We absolutely believe this is the best place to have it and we are going to have it there.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE: That was then, this is now. By the way, in that tweet, Chris, the president mentioned Camp David as a possible location for next year's G7 summit. It last hosted the G8 back in 2012 -- Chris.

WALLACE: Kevin Corke, reporting from the White House, Kevin, thanks from that.

Joining us now for an exclusive interview, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.

Mick, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"".

MULVANEY: Good morning.

Yes, I flinched a little bit because that's what people are saying that I said, but I didn't say that. But I'm looking forward to the conversation.

WALLACE: All right. Let's have a conversation.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Why -- here's my first question. Why did you say that in that briefing that President Trump had ordered a quid po qro (ph) -- quid pro quo, that investigating the Democrats, that aid to Ukraine depended on investigating the Democrats? Why did you say that?

MULVANEY: Again, that's not what I said. That's what people said I said.

Here's what I said, I'll say it again and hopefully people will listen this time.

There were two reasons that we held up the aid. We talked about this at some length. The first one was the rampant corruption in Ukraine. Ukraine -- by the way, Chris, it's so bad in Ukraine that in 2014, Congress passed a law making it -- making us -- requiring us to make sure that corruption was moving in the right direction. So, corruption is a big deal, everyone knows it.

The president was also concerned about whether or not other nations, specifically European nations, were helping with foreign aid to the Ukraine as well. We talked about that for quite a while now.

I did then mention that in the past, the president had mentioned for me to time to time about the DNC server. He had mentioned the DNC server to other people publicly. He even mentioned it to President Zelensky in the phone call, but it wasn't connected to the aid. And that's where I think people got sidetracked this weekend at that press conference.

WALLACE: But --

MULVANEY: Two reasons for holding back the aid --

WALLACE: Let me pursue that, though --

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: -- because I believe that anyone listening to what you said in that briefing could come to only one conclusion. Let's play what you said.

MULVANEY: Sure.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Did he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it, and that's what we held up the money.

REPORTER: What you just described is a quid pro quo. It is, funding will not flow unless the investigation into the -- into the Democrats' server happened as well.

MULVANEY: We do -- we do that all the time with foreign policy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl, was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aide?

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, it happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Yes. But go back and watch what I said before that. I don't know if you guys can cue it or not. There was a long answer about corruption and a long answer about foreign aid.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: No, you totally said that.

MULVANEY: Just like I told you then, and then I said the exact same thing I just said now, which is that he mentioned in passing yes, but the reason that we held back the aid with the two reasons I mentioned. And I can prove it to you. The aid flowed.

Once we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually -- they were doing better with it, we got that information from our folks from the conversation with Minister (ph) Zelensky and once we were able to establish we had the Office of Management and Budget do research on other countries' aid to Ukraine, it turns out they don't get any lethal aid, but they do give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid.

Once those two things were cleared, the money flowed. There was never any connection between the flow of money and the server.

WALLACE: But, Mick, you know, I hate to go through this, but you said what you said.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: And the fact is, after that exchange with Jonathan Karl, you were asked another time why the aide was held up. What was the condition for the aid? And you didn't mention two conditions, you mentioned three conditions.

And I want to -- and let's listen to all three of them because this -- you stated it very clearly. Let's listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Three issues for that. The corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That's completely legitimate.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Not only did you say that investigating the Democrats was one of the three conditions, not two, that you would just said that you would talk about, investigating the Democrats was part of the quid pro quo. You also said, if I may, it was part of the Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.

But the fact is that not only did the press think you said it, here's what a statement that was put out by a senior Justice Department official: If the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.

Everybody thinks that that's what you said and you didn't. You said right there --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- three points, not two.

MULVANEY: Well, and a couple different things. You again said just a few seconds ago that I said there was a quid pro quo. I never used that language, because there is not a quid pro quo, but --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: You were asked by Jonathan Karl, is -- you described a quid pro quo, and you said, that happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Well -- and reporters will use their language all the time. So, my language never said quid pro quo.

But let's get to the heart of the matter. Go back and look at that list of three things. What was I talking about? Things that was legitimate for the president to do.

Number one, it is legitimate for the president to want to know what's going on with the ongoing investigation into the server. Everybody acknowledges that -- at least I think most normal people do. It's completely legitimate to ask about that.

Number two, it's legitimate to tie the aid to corruption. It's legitimate to tie the aid to foreign aid from other countries. That's what I was talking about with the three.

Can I see how people took at the wrong way? Absolutely. But I never said there were was quid pro quo, because there isn't.

Again, Chris, you've been in these -- in these briefings. You know how back-and-forth is. You know how rapid-fire it is. Look to the facts on the ground, things that you can actually sort of certify.

And what should put this issue to bed is that the money flowed without any connection whatsoever to the DNC server.

WALLACE: But you -- in your first answer which I gave, you said that's why we held up the money. First, you just said here, that it was for two reasons. Now, you're acknowledging it was for three reasons.

If you held up the money for three reasons, that was -- that's a quid pro quo.

MULVANEY: I am not --

WALLACE: You got to satisfy us on those. Now, maybe the president backed off that, but that was the proposition here.

MULVANEY: I'm not acknowledging there's three reasons. Again, let's go back --

WALLACE: You said three reasons.

MULVANEY: Go back -- I recognize that. Go back to what actually happened in the real world.

And, by the way, go to the phone call, go to the phone call, which we've released. I hope you get a chance to talk about that before the --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I am going to right now.

MULVANEY: You go to the phone call, the president never mentions the aid at all in the phone call. Doesn't say, oh, by the way, I need you to do this, this, this and this or else the money won't flow.

We all know enough about this president that if he feels very strongly about something, he's going to put that out there directly and that didn't happen.

I recognize that folks -- that I didn't speak clearly maybe on Thursday, folks misinterpreted what I said, but the facts are absolutely clear and they are there for everyone to see.

WALLACE: In the briefing you flatly denied any connection between holding up the aide and investigating Joe Biden and his son, right?

MULVANEY: Correct.

WALLACE: OK. In his phone call with President Zelensky, however, President Trump specifically mentions the Bidens. Do me a favor. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani pushed all summer for Ukraine to announce it was investigating Burisma, the company that paid Hunter Biden.

And a former NSC official testified this week before Congress, John Bolton was so disturbed by the way you are directing people to work with Rudy Giuliani, he said, quote, I am not part of whatever drug deal -- he was speaking metaphorically --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- of whatever drug deal Sondland, the U.S. diplomat, and Mulvaney are cooking up.

No question you are following the president's orders, but your fingerprints are all over linking aid to Ukraine with investigating the Bidens.

MULVANEY: OK. No, that's not true. Let's go -- I'll take one of those of the time which is the Bolton thing, because I read that and I was surprised, because John Bolton never complained to me about it. No one at NSC ever complained to me about anything that was going on.

I didn't see Sondland's testimony this week because none of us have seen Sondland's testimony, which is another story entirely. I did get a chance to read his opening statement when he said that Bolton never complained to him. Fiona Hill never got a chance to complain to him.

I think you need to put sort of --

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Fiona Hill is the one who testified. That's the quote came from her.

MULVANEY: Who never complained to Sondland about what was happening, when it was happening.

WALLACE: No, she complained to her boss, John Bolton.

MULVANEY: Who did what?

WALLACE: Who said -- who told her to go immediately to a lawyer --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- at NSC and to complain about it.

MULVANEY: Who works for John Bolton. Yet John Bolton didn't go say anything to anybody. Doesn't that raise a red flag?

But let's go back to the first thing you talk about, which is the president's phone call, because at the end of the day, that's what this is really about, right? That's why we are here was the president phone call with Ukraine.

And you've done the same thing, and I don't blame you personally. Done the same thing with many news outlets have done. You said, do me a favor and then immediately to the Bidens.

Go look at the transcript of the phone conversation.

WALLACE: I have.

MULVANEY: It's, do me a favor, take a look at the DNC server. Then he talks about corruption in the Ukraine. He talks about Rudy Giuliani.

The president of the Ukraine gets on and he talks about a close cooperation between the countries. He talks about corruption. He talks about getting a new ambassador to the U.S.

And the president gets on and talks about Bill Barr. The president talks about a new ambassador between our countries, and then the very end of that passage mentions the Bidens.

Everybody else puts it on TV and says, do me a favor, look at the Bidens. And that's simply not factually accurate.

Go look at the transcript yourself.

WALLACE: Let's turn to Syria. Defense Secretary Esper overnight has said that those thousand troops who are being moved out of Syria are moving to Iraq. They are not as the president claimed coming home.

MULVANEY: Well, they will eventually. I think --

WALLACE: Eventually?

MULVANEY: The quickest way to get them out of danger was to get them into Iraq. Keep in mind what you are facing here. And I think literally the number was 28. You had 28 U.S. Special Forces between tens of thousands of soldiers on one side and tens of thousands of soldiers on the other side.

And I hope that when we release the letter this week, it put -- it put to the bed this nonsense about how the president supposedly green-lighted this invasion. Nothing would be further from the truth and I think the letter made that painfully clear.

WALLACE: No, no, the letter has been released.

MULVANEY: It has been, but I hope now people realize and -- it was -- listen, this is what we deal with this administration all the time. Whether it's on the impeachment or it's on the Ukraine or -- excuse me, on Syria, is people (ph) say, oh, there's a green light. The president green- lighted this and that's what the press reports.

And then we put out facts that absolutely put that to bed and no one comes back and says, well, we were wrong about that.

Go back to the beginning of the impeachment, how did that start, oh, there were supposedly a transcript with eight references to the Bidens and a quid pro quo on foreign aid -- absolutely false. No one ever went back and said, we were wrong about that either.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: So --

WALLACE: I do -- I'm running out of time and I do have several more questions.

MULVANEY: Lots of things to talk about.

WALLACE: Yes, we do.

I just want to go back to the briefing for one minute. After the briefing and all the blowback and the criticism, did you ever offer or think to offer the president your resignation?

MULVANEY: No, absolutely not.

WALLACE: Was that ever discussed?

MULVANEY: Absolutely, positively not.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: No, I'm -- listen, I'm very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference? No. But again, the facts were on our side.

I didn't get a chance to talk about some of the stuff I wanted to talk about at that press conference, which was, for example, Senator Menendez sending a letter to the Ukraine saying, if you don't cooperate with Mueller, there will be repercussions for you. I haven't had a chance to talk about -- talk about a quid pro quo, Joe Biden admitting that he said he was going to cut off funding unless the prosecutor got fired. If that's not a quid pro quo, I don't know what it is.

So, I haven't a chance at the presser to do everything I wanted to, but I still think I'm doing a pretty good job as the chief of staff and I think the president agrees.

WALLACE: There seems to be a growing number of Republicans in Congress who are -- if not breaking with the president, distancing themselves from the president.

You had Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who wrote a scathing article about Syria this week. I'm going to put up one of these quotes.

Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake and a strategic nightmare for our country.

House Republicans voted against the Trump policy in Syria 129-60, more than 2-1.

And I talked to a very well-connected Republican in Washington this week, somebody whose name you would know well, who says that if the House votes to impeach and it gets to a trial in the Senate, there is now a 20 percent chance he believes -- obviously, it's just an estimate -- now a 20 percent chance enough Republicans will vote with the Democrats to remove the president.

MULVANEY: Oh, that's just absurd. But let's deal with the issue of Syria.

WALLACE: No, let's deal with the issue of whether Republicans -- you're losing your support.

MULVANEY: Same thing. This comment about a 20 percent chance, the person clearly doesn't know what they're talking about.

But talk about the reaction of the Republicans and Democrats up on the Hill to the decision in Syria, president knew that was going to happen. He recognizes the fact that it's not a politically popular in this town to make the decision that he made to move the troops out of Syria. He ran on it. He told people he would do this if he won and he's doing it now because he won.

WALLACE: Forgive me for interrupting, we are running out of time, I just want to ask you, though -- is there any concern that the president is losing those support of Republicans in Congress?

MULVANEY: No, the president is extraordinary popular back home, more popular in the swing districts now that impeachment has started.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I'm talking about here in Washington.

MULVANEY: Yes, but they -- they have to go home eventually as well. So, no.

Do I have to understand that there are certain folks, especially the neoconservative wing of the party who are upset about the Syria decision? I absolutely do. The president knew that was going to happen.

Again, elections have consequences on foreign policy. That's where we started this conversation and that thankfully they do.

WALLACE: Two final questions. One, a -- one of the people who was testifying in Congress this week in the House impeachment investigation also said that he was so concerned about Hunter Biden getting that job in Ukraine in 2015 that he went to the vice president staff, Biden was then vice president, and said, this looks really bad. And that he was turned away.

Your reaction?

MULVANEY: Good. I'm surprised I haven't heard about it since. My guess is if it happened (ph) during the Trump administration, the news media would have reported on it at very next day.

WALLACE: I'm asking you about it, sir.

MULVANEY: I know you are. And I appreciate that. I'm hearing about it for the first time, I look forward to finding out more about it. It's the first I've heard of that piece of information.

WALLACE: You had not heard -- it's been reported widely in the last 48 hours.

MULVANEY: No, I've been busy in the last 48 hours, Chris.

WALLACE: OK. Well, let me ask you of something else, maybe you don't know this.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: But President Trump has decided after he put you out there in that briefing --

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: -- to announce Doral -- he is back -- he's decided that he's not going to hold it at Doral. He blames it on, quote, the hostile media and their Democratic partners.

But again, he was getting hammered by Republicans. So, why did he cave?

MULVANEY: I -- we talked about it at great length last night, and it's not lost on me that if we made the decision on Thursday, we wouldn't have had the press conference on Thursday regarding -- regarding everything else, but that's fine.

But we did talk about it last night and I honestly think what he is out in the tweet was real. The president isn't one for holding back his feelings and his emotions about something. He was honestly surprised at the level of pushback.

At the end of the day, you know, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world, and he wanted to put the absolute best show, the best visit that he possibly could. And he was very comfortable doing it at Doral, and I think we're all surprised at the level of pushback.

I think it's the right decision to change. We'll have to find someplace else. And my guess is we'll find someplace else that the media won't like either for another reason.

WALLACE: I just have to pick up -- you say he considers himself in the hospitality business.

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: He's the president of the United States.

MULVANEY: Yes, but he's -- that's his background. It's like, I used to be in the real estate business. I don't know what you used to do before you were in the media.

WALLACE: Nothing. That's all I've ever done.

MULVANEY: Yes.

But he wanted to put on a show. He wanted to take care of folks. That's the business -- he's in the hotel business or at least he was before he was the president.

WALLACE: Does he understand -- forget the media -- does he understand that it looked lousy?

MULVANEY: Well, I think he knows. He thinks people think it looks lousy.

Could we have put on an excellent G7 at Doral? Absolutely. Will we end up putting on an excellent G7 someplace else? Yes, we will.

WALLACE: Mick, thank you. Thanks for coming in. Always good to talk with you, sir.

MULVANEY: It's always good to be here. Thank you, sir.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss where the House impeachment investigation stands now. And new evidence U.S. officials were concerned as far back as 2015 about Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: For three straight years, radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great, great election -- maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump rallying supporters in Dallas against the House impeachment investigation.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz; FOX News political analyst Juan Williams; former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman; and from ""The Wall Street Journal"", Kimberley Strassel, author of the new book, ""Resistance (At All Cost"".

Well, Congressman Chaffetz, let me start with you. How damaging do you think the last week has been to President Trump? Testimony from a number of current and former national security officials that the president had Rudy Giuliani's personal lawyer running off-the-books operations when it came to Ukraine. And whatever you make of them, Mick Mulvaney's comments about a quid pro quo?

JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN, R-UT: Well, I wish there was video to show of what was going on in these so-called impeachment hearings because they haven't been open and transparent. I think what Adam Schiff did when he lied, he physically lied in front of the committee when he had a chance to go and talk about that, I don't think they're laying a glove on Donald Trump.

Inside the beltway, there's a frenzy. Out in the heartland, in the Dallas, Texases of the world, it's not moving the meter at all.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Harman, how strong is the case that's being built against the president?

JANE HARMAN, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-CALIF.: Well, I'm not in the room either, but to be clear, these are depositions, they're not hearings. There are various people were talking under oath. Republicans and Democrats are in the room. The questions are primarily being asked by counsel. But Republicans and Democrats had equal time to ask questions.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: OK. But enough about the process, what do you think of the substance?

HARMAN: So, you know, the substance leaks out, and it's in the press, but I think it hasn't been a good week for the president.

Two good things happened. One is, I think sort of kind of good week, he backed off on the China tariffs. That's a big deal because the economy was about to -- it seems to me soft into a point that it really hurt him. But the other sort of kind of big deal is our troops are moving to Iraq, they are not leaving the area. So, there will be some counter-ISIS movement.

That does not mean I think his Syria decision made any sense. I don't think so. I agree with Mitch McConnell.

WALLACE: Maybe the biggest surprise in my interview with Mick Mulvaney is he doesn't seem to have known about the revelations this week about Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden finally answered questions about his business dealings in Ukraine. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

INTERVIEWER: If your last name wasn't Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?

HUNTER BIDEN, SON OF JOE BIDEN: I don't know, I don't know. Probably not. I don't think that there's a lot of things that wouldn't have happened in my life that if my last name wasn't Biden.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But, Kim, we also learned that one of those State Department officials who testified before the House impeachment investigation this week was so disturbed in 2015 when Hunter Biden started working for this Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, and that -- at least the appearance if nothing else, at least the appearance that it seemed to be self-dealing, that he went to the vice president himself, because Biden, of course, was then Vice President, and said this really looks bad and he was turned away.

How big a deal?

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Yes, I mean, I think it is a big deal. It surprised no one though because prior to the press deciding that this was a whole issue that we're not allowed to talk about, Joe Biden did nothing wrong, they were writing all the stories about this, and quoting former officials who worked for Joe Biden saying they were uneasy with the situation. And they didn't like that it was happening.

And so -- I mean, the issue here to me has always been -- people like to use the word ""corrupt"", the issue was always been the appearance question, right? It's the question of whether or not Hunter Biden was profiting off of his father's position. You don't really need to go much further than that.

And it is hurting Joe Biden out there with primary voters.

WALLACE: Let's pick up on that one because the president who doesn't like the back down did back down overnight and say, well, OK, I'm not going to hold the summit next June, the G7 summit in Doral, his own resort -- there was really a lot of squealing about it from Republicans and Democrats who said it appeared to be this kind of self-dealing, do you think one of the reasons that he may have done it is because it would certainly -- it seemed to blunt his case against Joe Biden?

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it did. I think the cancellation is a tiny step in the right direction. But again, this is so blatant and over-the-top self-dealing on the part of the president, putting his self interest, or as Mick Mulvaney said to you, his history as a man in the hospitality business, about the national interest. I think that then speaks to behold Ukrainian deal.

But on a larger point, I think it's one of the campaign promises that he broke. He said he was going to divest himself of all business interests. So this cancellation is a step in the right direction, but think for a second about the idea that he has no problem appointing Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, as some kind of emissary to the Middle East and he's dealing with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, a man who's killed journalists and making excuses. I think this is -- again, this is this is not normal.

WALLACE: That's just a decision, and as Mick Mulvaney said about Rudy Giuliani, the president gets to decide who he wants to do his business. That's just the policy issue.

WILLIAMS: I think that -- again, you're putting your family in positions of critical policy. So, it's apart from the normal operation of foreign policy in the country. It's like the shadow foreign policy that was run by Giuliani.

But again, to my mind, you look at Doral -- the reason I say it's part of a pattern, Chris, is Doral was a struggling property, here is the president saying, here, I'm going to help my own business and forever branded as the prestigious pot because of the G7 was held there.

WALLACE: Kim?

STRASSEL: Well, look, this is a very complicated subject. I'm glad that he decided not to do it because I do think it blunts his message about the appearance of conflict with Hunter Biden. There is a very complicated discussion to be had about whether or not Donald Trump's business empire has actually profited from his business (ph) or more likely, as much of the reporting has shown, he's probably taken a hit. I mean, there's good evidence that his bookings are down out a lot of his places and some --

WALLACE: Nobody made him run for president.

STRASSEL: No, no, I'm not saying -- I mean, I'm just saying I'm not like arguing, oh, poor president. I'm just saying, look at the numbers. You can't just run around and say, oh, you know, the president is profiting off of his presidency, like I think you just have to look at the facts. Yes.

WALLACE: But, Kim, it's about profit.

STRASSEL: Look at the facts.

WALLACE: The emoluments clause says you can't take any compensation from a foreign government.

STRASSEL: Well, we have never had a discussion in the court system about what the emoluments clause actually (INAUDIBLE).

WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying, that's what it says.

WALLACE: Well, there are actually a few court cases right now.

HARMAN: We're having it now.

WALLACE: So, we'll see.

All right, we've got to --

STRASSEL: We're going to find out.

WALLACE: Folks, I've got to save time for you for the next panel.

We have to take a break here. Up next, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins us here in Washington after a debate that has some Democrats saying he can compete with Joe Biden as the centrist voice of the party.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Mayor Pete Buttigieg hot off the debate stage, where he went toe to toe with his Democratic rivals.

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-IND., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask him, what's his path to the nomination.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Pete Buttigieg is trying to get back into the top tier of 2020 Democratic candidates. And a strong performance in this week's debate paid off with more than $1 million in campaign contributions in the first 24 hours after the debate.

Joining us now is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

And, Mayor, welcome back.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: Let's start with your latest poll numbers. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys, you're in fourth place nationally at 5.8 percent, fourth in Iowa with 13 percent, and fourth in New Hampshire at 8.7 percent. As a candidate from the Midwest, and also looking at those numbers, don't you have to finish in the top at least two or three in Iowa or you're done?

BUTTIGIEG: I think it's certainly the case that a strong performance in Iowa is going to be critical to us winning the nomination. And that's what we're building toward. We've got a terrific ground game there, over 22, I believe, field offices now and 100 organizers, and I think a message that's really connecting with Iowans. You know, Democrats there, first and foremost, of course, want to know that we can defeat and replace President Trump. Also want to know how the policies we're putting forward are going to affect their lives. And whether it's Medicare for all who want it or the vision we're putting forward on any of a number of issues, we find that it's resonating.

But even now there are so many Iowans who maybe have it narrowed down to a top three or so but are taking their time, evaluating their choices. And we've got our work cut out for us to close the deal between now and the caucus.

WALLACE: You have stalled to some degree in the polls, as we just pointed out, at least nationally, ever since that terrible police shooting in South Bend, Indiana, this summer. And folks noticed a more aggressive performance by you in this last debate, taking on Elizabeth Warren on Medicare for all, Tulsi Gabbard on troops in Syria, and Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks.

Take a look at you.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BUTTIGIEG: Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. Respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong.

I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Was that a conscious effort to jumpstart your campaign?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, these are also topics I'm very passionate about. When it comes to what is being done to not just the Middle East, for example, but to American credibility. The fact that right now people who put their lives on the line, trusting that the United States would have their back, and are now betrayed, the fact that U.S. troops in the field feel that their honor has been stolen from them by their commander in chief, how can you not be fired up about something like that? And this is the season for us to lay out what we care about, what we're passionate about, and what's different among each of the candidates. And I want to make sure there's no question in any voter's mind how their life would be different under my presidency than if any of the others were to be elected.

WALLACE: Well, one of the distinctions you drew sharply is you said that 2021, if a Democrat is elected president, the -- the country can make historic gains on health care and immigration and guns, but not, you said, if they push too far and promise too much.

Do you think that some of the solutions that are being offered, whether it's on climate change, Medicare for all, by Senators Warren and Sanders, are too drastic?

BUTTIGIEG: I think that we have a chance to build an American majority around bold action. But it is the case that we could wreck that majority through purity tests. Look, take the example of this Medicare question. I'm proposing Medicare for all who want it. It means we create a version of Medicare, everybody can get access to it, and if you get -- if you want to keep your private plan, we're OK with that. I think that's a better policy than kicking people off of their plan.

But I also think that it's something that more Americans can get behind. And when you think about the condition our country's going to be in when this presidency comes to an end, one way or the other, when you think about how torn apart by politics we're going to be, how polarized and divided this country is, this, to me, is not a political question, it's a question of governing. The good news is, we can govern in a very bold and forward-leading direction, but we've got to make sure we do it in a way that moves toward unifying rather than further polarizing the American people.

WALLACE: Not surprisingly, the left is firing back at you when Elizabeth Warren said that she will not participate in big fundraisers, even if she is the Democratic nominee against Donald Trump in -- next fall. You said this, let's put it on the screen, we are not going to beat him -- Trump -- with pocket change. Here's how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded. Small dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttigieg insults here as pocket change, out fundraised him by millions. Our nation's leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it.

So, what do you have to say to AOC?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, you don't go from mayor of South Bend to a competitive presidential candidate without knowing a thing or two about grassroots campaigning. My campaign is fueled by the contributions of almost 600,000 individual donors. And most of those are small contributions. What I'm saying is that we can't go into this fight against Donald Trump with one hand tied behind our back.

Look, the president of the United States and his allies just raised $125 million. They will pull out all of the stops to stay in power. And I think we have a responsibility to the country to make sure that we go into this fight, as Democrats, with everything that we've got, and not unilaterally disarming.

We indeed need to end the era of big money politics. That's why campaign finance reform is so important. And it will never happen as long as the folks currently in charge stay there.

WALLACE: The last time you and I talked was in August and I pointed out to you -- perhaps not too charitably -- that you were at zero percent in the polls among African-Americans. There's a new poll out in the last few days. You're now at two percent support among African-Americans.

When we last talked, you -- you -- you described a big outreach to minority communities, the African-American community. Why isn't it working?

BUTTIGIEG: Look, for me this isn't about the polls, this is about making sure that –

WALLACE: Well, in the end, it is about the polls.

BUTTIGIEG: But in order to do well, you need to deserve to do well. And we're focusing on the substance of what I have to offer. Voters want to know how their lives will be different. And in the case of African-American voters, they want to know what my agenda is for black Americans.

We're putting forward the most comprehensive plan of any candidate to tackle systemic racism in this country. It's everything from empowering black entrepreneurs and fueling business development, to making sure we deal with discrimination in housing and in health, to cutting incarceration in this country by 50 percent because we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately harms African-Americans. We need to continue making that case. It's extremely well-received whenever I have a chance to offer it up, but there are a lot of voters who are still sizing up their options, who need to feel like they know you. And our job is to do that in a short amount of time.

WALLACE: I want to press down on this just a little bit because you talk about needing to deserve it and voters trying to understand who you are.

You were supposed to attend a big fundraiser in Chicago on Friday. And one of the hosts was the same city attorney who worked very hard to block release of this video of police shooting Laquan McDonald. The lawyer backed out of -- of the fundraiser. He also donated $5,600 to your campaign. Particularly at a time when African-Americans are trying to get to know you, isn't that the kind of mistake, Mayor, that you can't afford to make?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, this came to my attention in the morning and within an hour it had been taken care of. Look, the situation there and justice and transparency for Laquan McDonald is much more important to me than a campaign contribution. And we did the right thing as soon as it came to my attention.

WALLACE: Can you understand where people would say, well, this is a guy who wants our vote but he was going to take -- was taking money, and was attending a fundraiser being held by this city attorney?

BUTTIGIEG: And then we took care of it.

Look, I think the biggest question on voter's minds is, how is my life going to be different, especially when that sun comes up, that first day after Donald Trump is president. And the agenda that I'm putting forward, the -- the issues that I want to tackle, I think will speak to black voters and to all voters who are seeking a better life in this country and seeking to turn the page from the chaos and the corruption that we're living under right now.

WALLACE: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you. Safe travels on the campaign trail, sir.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: When we come back, Turkey agrees to a temporary ceasefire in Syria. We'll ask our Sunday group what it means for U.S. interests in the Middle East.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The Kurds are very happy./ Turkey is very happy. The United States is very happy. And, you know what, civilization is very happy. It's a great thing for civilization.

WALLACE: President Trump with an optimistic assessment of the cease-fire brokered by Vice President Pence this week in Turkey.

And we're back now with the panel.

Congresswoman Harman, what you think of the deal that the U.S. made with Turkey?

HARMAN: I think, sadly, Pence and his advisors were scrambling on the plane to come up with some kind of announcement that would make sense. And I salute Pence for trying. However, I don't think he succeeded. I think a deal under these circumstances was impossible. And where we are now is the ceasefire is not holding, the Kurds, our allies, who lost 11,000 people on the battlefield, we lost six, are being massacred. There is now a vacuum being filled by ISIS, by Syria, the Syrian government, and by Russia.

And, guess what, Israel, our -- our deepest ally in the region, is now surrounded by Iran on the Syrian border, by Iran making the missiles from Libya -- from Lebanon smarter on the Lebanese border and by Iran and Tehran. And this is creating an existential threat and leading to really dangerous circumstances.

And, finally, ISIS is regrouping and the ISIS fighters that are regrouping are from Europe and they will get through the Turkish border and attack in Europe.

WALLACE: Congressman Chaffetz, even a lot of staunch Trump supporter's inside the Republican Party have real problems with the agreement and -- and the actions by the president in northern Syria.

Your thoughts?

JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: I think the agreement was good, although temporary. We'll see how it stands above and beyond the last few days.

But the president did the right thing. He did exactly what he was campaigning on doing. I believe if you -- if you can't go and fight and win the war, then you bring them home. And, you know what, if the Senate and the House feel so strongly, then pass a piece of legislation. Don't just do some little slap on the hand and right an op-ed and say, oh, tisk, tisk, Mr. President.

WALLACE: You -- you're talking about Mitch McConnell?

CHAFFETZ: Yes. I'm saying that they should actually pass a war powers authorization and do that. Put on your big boy pants and do that.

But the president's doing the right thing.

WALLACE: And then there was the meeting on Syria that was held at the White House this week. Here's the indelible picture of it. It ended with President Trump calling Speaker Pelosi, depending on the account you heard, either a third rate or a third grade politician, not a complement in either case, and Pelosi getting up, as you see here, and walking out.

Here's what they said afterwards.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: That crazy Nancy. She is crazy.

PELOSI: I pray for the president all the time, and I tell them that. I pray for his safety and that of his family. The -- now we have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Juan, not only can't they legislate in Congress anymore, they've apparently can't even stand to be in each other's presence.

WILLIAMS: No, I mean, it's -- to me what's key here is that I think you see from the House vote that even Republicans were shocked out of their silence in -- in responding to President Trump by his decision.

WALLACE: You think you'd vote against the president's Syria policy?

WILLIAMS: I think you said it earlier, 129 Republicans voted with the Democratic majority. So it clearly showed there is bipartisan outrage at allowing our allies, the Kurds, to be slaughtered by the Turks in this way.

With response -- in response to your question about the meeting, I think that Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, speaker of the House, the minority leader in the Senate, were strong enough to confront the president in the meeting, to get in his face and say, this is the wrong policy. And the president responded with elementary school, you know, schoolyard bullying, third rate politician. Nancy Pelosi is no third rate politician by anybody's measure.

But I think the key here is the policy, Chris, the policy is the problem. And to be clear, and I think this is in response that Congressman Chaffetz point, this is not about bringing troops home. There are only about 150 troops involved. The president just sent 2,000 to Saudi Arabia. So, I mean, to me, this is about the president pulling our influence out of there, allowing our allies to be slaughtered, and compromising America's integrity and promise to our allies. It's a foreign policy quagmire.

WALLACE: Kim, I wanted you to address a different aspect of that, which is that both sides talk about being able to walk and chew gum at the same time, trying to get some things done. The one thing they particularly talk about is passing the USMCA, the U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Can they get anything done between the impeachment investigation, the bitterness from that, and the fact that we're -- you could say we're all already in a full-fledged campaign. Certainly by the end of the year we're in a full-fledged campaign.

STRASSEL: Right. I mean whatever happened in that meeting and the dueling narratives, it almost doesn't matter because what it exposes is what you just said, is that when Democrats decided they were going to go forward with this impeachment inquiry, it created a new dynamic in Washington. And this is one of the consequences of it.

I do not see how anyone gets anything done while they're in the middle of - - I mean, think of it from the Trump White House perspective. They're trying to remove him from office. And that just does make it a very difficult circumstance in which he -- then sit down, shake hands, play nice.

I agree, everyone would want there to be progress and I think that the best thing the Trump White House could do would be, to fact, to kind of rise above it and talk about governing and talk about what they've accomplished and what they want to accomplish. But I'm not quite sure that is going to be the dynamic going forward.

HARMAN: Government funding --

WALLACE: Congresswoman, I've got less than a minute left.

Does impeachment and politics poison everything? Does anything get done in Washington between now and November 2020?

HARMAN: Well, that was the history of the Clinton impeachment, everything stopped. But government funding runs out on November 21st, in the middle of whatever it is that we're going to see. And I think it would be tragic if, once again, we put federal workers and -- and the economy through that nightmare. So the Congress has to pass the budget bills. There has to be progress. And I think the leadership of Congress somehow will find a way forward.

WALLACE: So the most they can do is keep the government running?

HARMAN: Keep the government running. Right.

WALLACE: All right.

Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" trying to solve the 82-year-old mystery, what happened to Amelia Earhart?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: It is one of the enduring mysteries of the 20th and now the 21st century, but a renowned explorer is determined to solve it.

Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERT BALLARD, DEEP-SEA EXPLORER: She said, I can do anything, and then went out and did it.

WALLACE (voice over): Robert Ballard is talking about America Earhart, the world-famous aviator, who's this mysterious disappearance 82 years ago has only added to her legend.

In August, Ballard led an expedition to find some trace of Earhart or her plane. It's the subject of a new ""National Geographic"" documentary.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's shedding new light on one of the world's most captivating people.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In ship number six, it's the world-famous Amelia Earhart.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) is good to go.

BALLARD: It exists. It's not the Loch Ness Monster. It's not Bigfoot. That plane exists, which means you can find it.

WALLACE: Earhart was on an around the world trip in 1937 when her plane vanished in the Pacific.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For years she pushed the boundaries of what was humanly possible, shattering a dozen records in the air, while breaking barriers for women on the ground.

WALLACE: The leading theory is Earhart ran out of gas near a tiny atoll called Nikumaroro. And that's where Ballard took his ship, the Nautilus, spending two weeks searching the coral reef with surface vessels, drones, and remote underwater vehicles.

BALLARD: It's just hours and hours and hours and hours searching at night with a flashlight. You never know.

WALLACE: Thirty-four years ago, Ballard led another expedition and shocked the world by discovering Titanic.

WALLACE (on camera): How does this search compare to searching for and finding Titanic?

BALLARD: This one's tougher. A lot tougher.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard feels a kinship with Earhart. They're both Kansans. But there's more.

BALLARD: I always have people say, you're nuts. You can't do it. And then I go do it.

WALLACE (on camera): And is there some Amelia Earhart in that too?

BALLARD: You bet there's a lot of Amelia Earhart in the sky.

WALLACE (voice over): For two weeks Ballard and his team searched the area, on land in case Earhart survived a crash, and underwater.

BALLARD: Whoa. Whoa, that looks like coral, but it's got a hole.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's got a perfect hole. Want to simple it.

BALLARD: Yes, just flip it over.

We pounded the area. This was a full court press with everything we had.

WALLACE (on camera): And, in the end, what did you find?

BALLARD: We didn't find the plane.

WALLACE: How big a disappointment?

BALLARD: Well, you know, I know where it isn't.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard says that's science. You go down dark alleys, then don't go down them again. Now he plans another expedition in two years using new technology to another site nearby.

BALLARD: I love the toys as much as I -- I love the hunt.

WALLACE (on camera): And you get to do both here.

BALLARD: Absolutely. I love developing the technology, going out and using it, and then coming home and sharing the story.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: The special exhibition, ""Amelia,"" premieres tonight on the National Geographic Channel.

Time now for one final note.

We have declared ourselves the unofficial Sunday show of the Washington Nationals. This week they clinched the National League championship in a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, setting up the National's first trip to the World Series. They'll play the Houston Astros in game one of the series Tuesday night right here on Fox.

And someone is so excited that he showed up here today, Teddy Roosevelt, one of the raising (ph) presidents from Nats park has dropped by and Teddy has delegated me to say, go Nats!

WILLIAMS: Go Nats!

CHAFFETZ: Go Nationals!

WALLACE: Teddy, here you go. Don't hold me hanging.

Oh, my God.

WILLIAMS: Go Teddy!

WALLACE: And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

Elizabeth Warren is known as the candidate with the plans, but Senate colleague and presidential nomination rival Sen. Cory Booker begs to differ.

“There’s no bigger policy wonk nerd in this race than me. Anybody who knows me in the Senate, that’s my forte,” Booker, D-N.J., highlighted Monday in an interview with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com.

Booker, who was interviewed aboard his campaign’s New Hampshire RV, emphasized that “there’s been 170-180 plans put out by every candidate. We’re all putting out plans. I love mine. I think in so many cases my plans are better. Heck, we are the only people to put out a plan on child poverty. How can that be?”

WARREN SAYS SHE'LL UNVEIL HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR HER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL PLAN

And, he indirectly took aim at Warren, D-Mass., who’s soared in recent months to a tie with former Vice President Joe Biden for the top spot in the 2020 primary race.

“I stand with Elizabeth Warren. I think ‘Medicare-for-all’ is the best way to do it. But, I also actually believe that it’s going to be a process to get there,” Booker noted. “We can’t be in a situation where we’re just talking away insurance from folks.”

Warren has been a major supporter of the “Medicare-for-all” plan introduced in the Senate by 2020 rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. The government-run plan, if enacted, would eliminate private insurance.

Booker, spotlighting his pragmatism, added, “I will not be one of those folks on the stage that’s so rigid to say, ‘It’s my way or the highway and I’m going to sacrifice progress for purity. I’m going to let perfect be the enemy of the good,’ when every American needs more good.”

Asked if some of his nomination rivals were too rigid, Booker answered, “that’s what voters are going to have to decide.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren came under repeated attack at last week’s fourth-round primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for middle-class Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run “Medicare-for-all” plan. She announced Sunday that she would soon reveal how the country would pay for it if she were president.

Booker has built up a formidable team in New Hampshire and Iowa, the first two states to vote in the caucus and primary calendar. Analysts have called him a skilled retail campaigner and arguably the best orator in the record-setting field of presidential contenders. But, he’s yet to pop in the polls or have many viral moments.

However, with three and a half months to go until the voting begins, that’s fine with Booker.

“The people that usually win are the people who peak in January, February, not people who are winning in the summer or winning in the fall. We’ve just got to continue doing the work,” he noted.

And, pointing to one-time longshots who ended up winning the nomination and eventually the White House, he said, “the more people who hear my message, the more [success] and momentum we’re getting and I’m hoping that continues to rise. And, by the time we’re in next year, I hope we’ll do what Bill Clinton, the comeback kid, or Jimmy Carter – who won New Hampshire – I’ll follow in their footsteps.”"

Warren, one of the leading Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020, spoke to reporters Monday after an event at Roosevelt High school in Des Moines, Iowa, when the topic of “Medicare-for-all” was raised.

During the media gaggle, Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked Warren: “How should caucus-goers be confident it is possible to pay for 'Medicare-for-all’ at all if the leading Democratic candidate still needs a few more weeks to tell them how it is going to get paid for?”

In response, Warren replied: “Well, why don’t you ask me that when the plan is out.”

POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE

She did not give any further details.

Warren has been criticized in recent weeks for not explaining exactly how she would cover the costs for her ambitious plan, with two fellow 2020 contenders taking issue with her during last week’s debate.

After being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate in Ohio last Tuesday whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health0care proposal, the progressive senator didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging, “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Moments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who’s soared in polling in recent months and has been considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden.

ELIZABETH WARREN APPARENTLY SCRUBS DNA-TEST ROLLOUT FROM CAMPAIGN SITE, TWITTER

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this 'Medicare-for-all’ plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Warren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: “Let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,’ understand what that means: It’s 'Medicare for all who can afford it,’ and that’s the problem we’ve got. 'Medicare-for-all’ is the gold standard.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren.

The Minnesota Democrat said, “At least [Bernie Sanders is] being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up, and I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

Suggesting that Warren would never be able to pass her 'Medicare-for-all’ plan through Congress, Klobuchar said: “The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.”

Biden also chimed in, jabbing at Warren without naming her, accusing her of not being straightforward.

“On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it’s awfully important to be straightforward with them,” Biden noted. “The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.”

Bernie Sanders of Vermont proudly calls himself a democratic socialist. But fellow Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – who holds many similar extreme-leftist positions – claims she’s really a capitalist.

That’s a claim that would add a few feet to Pinocchio’s nose.

Warren can call herself anything she wants. She falsely called herself a Native American for years and finally had to apologize for that instance of mislabeling. But if truth in packaging laws applied to politicians, Warren would have to admit she’s no more a capitalist than she is a Native American.

CHARLES PAYNE: ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS TO BREAK APART AN ECONOMY THAT'S WORKING

With her long record of promoting socialist causes and her calls for massive new job-killing government regulations and huge tax increases – on income, wealth, and whatever she can think of to take money from hard-working individuals and businesses – Warren is as much of a socialist as Sanders.

While their views aren’t are identical, the true ideological colors of Comrade Bernie and Comrade Elizabeth are both shades of red.

In the wake of Sanders’ recent heart attack, Warren appears better positioned than ever to become the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nominee.

Real Clear Politics’ average of recent presidential surveys shows Warren is now polling eight percentage points higher than Sanders. And in two national surveys – one by The Economist and another by Quinnipiac – Warren is polling higher than the longstanding front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.

Although Biden has been considered a lock to win the nomination by some analysts for months, it seems unlikely he will be able to compete with a far-left challenger like Warren or Sanders once the race inevitably narrows.

Although Biden is unquestionably a progressive whose policies would cause substantial damage to the U.S., he’s not a radical who wants to dynamite the capitalist system that has made America the most prosperous and powerful nation on the planet. But that’s exactly what Warren and Sanders want to do.

It doesn’t help that Biden’s TV debate performances have made the former vice president look more than a little confused. At times, it appears Biden isn’t sure where he is or what year it is – never mind what the candidates are debating.

Warren is a different story entirely. Her debate performances have been sharp and, at times, impressive – though she sometimes sounds like a nagging schoolteacher berating her young students.

Why, exactly, hasn’t Warren been labeled a “socialist”? The biggest – and perhaps the only – reason is that she and others in her party and the left-leaning media continue to insist she isn’t one, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary.

For example, in an Oct. 13 interview with ABC News’s “This Week,” Sanders said: “There are differences between Elizabeth and myself. Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Like many of the things oozing from Comrade Bernie’s mouth, this, too, is false. Warren is a socialist through and through and her dangerous, destructive policy plans would – like all socialist proposals – cause substantial harm to America’s economy and society, hurting everyone, including the most impoverished.

Warren understands that if she says she’s a socialist, she’ll lose support from moderate voters whose support she would need in the general election to defeat President Trump. So she pretends she’s not what she really is.

Here are just some of Warren’s many frightening socialist plans for the United States:

Warren has endorsed the “Just Society” proposal of socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. This radical idea would – among other things – redefine poverty in the United States so that potentially tens of millions of additional Americans will be pushed onto social welfare programs like Medicaid. A “Just Society” would also make it illegal to deny illegal immigrants and those who have been convicted of crimes access to welfare programs.

Warren has proposed what she calls The Accountable Capitalism Act. This would force every corporation in America with $1 billion or more in annual revenue to obtain a federal charter from a new regulatory agency. The legislation would require that at least 40 percent of corporate board member be elected by workers, and impose costly new bureaucratic regulations on companies. This would likely cause a mass exodus of the most important businesses from the U.S. – stunting economic growth, sending unemployment skyrocketing, and increasing the national debt

Warren has also proposed imposing a single-payer health care system. This would outlaw most forms of private health insurance and force the more than 140 million Americans now enrolled in private insurance plans onto government-managed health plans – all at a cost of $32 trillion over 10 years. Single-payer models elsewhere in the world require very high taxes and have led to rationing of health care and long wait times. This rationing increases unnecessary pain and suffering for millions of people and in the most extreme cases can lead to some patient deaths.

Warren also wants to spend $500 billion over 10 years to build millions of new housing units, and trillions of dollars to cancel college student loan debt for 42 million Americans. She would also “give every American the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year public college without paying a dime in tuition or fees.”

Warren, like Sanders, was one of the original cosponsors of Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. This is the most radical, dangerous, environmentally destructive proposal in modern American history. The Green New Deal would destroy millions of jobs by eliminating most forms of fossil fuel generation and use, including that gasoline-powered vehicle you drive to work every day. It would also create a new system of publicly-owned banks, basic income programs, a federal jobs guarantee, massive new green housing mandates, a universal health food program, and countless new “social justice” programs.

These proposals – and the incredibly high tax increases needed to fund them – would push the U.S. closer than ever to full-blown Marxism, and they are without any doubt in line with socialist principles. This is why self-described socialists like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have embraced or even proposed the vast majority of them.

With Halloween just around the corner, millions of children will be dressing up for one night pretending to be all sorts of characters. Warren has stopped pretending to be a Native American, but pretends every day to be a capitalist – while she knows very well that she’s a socialist through and through.

For the sake of our country and the American people, let’s hope voters see through Warren’s masquerade.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The 37-year old mayor – the youngest candidate in the White House race -- stands at 13 percent in a Suffolk University/USA Today poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers released Monday. Biden, at 18 percent, and Warren, at 17 percent, were tied for the top spot in the survey.

WALLACE CHALLENGES BUTTIGIEG ON 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY'

Buttigieg -- who served in the U.S. Naval Reserve in the Afghanistan War and would be the nation’s first openly gay president if elected -- was up seven percentage points since the previous Suffolk University/USA Today poll in Iowa, in June.

The new poll was conducted Wednesday through Friday, entirely after last Tuesday’s fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate. Political pundits gave a more aggressive Buttigieg high marks for taking on Warren over how she’d pay for her Medicare-for-all health care plan, targeting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over her anti-interventionist stance, and clashing with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke over his mandatory gun buy back proposal.

Buttigieg was followed in the poll by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who stood at 9 percent.

""Iowa is unquestionably up for grabs,"" Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said.

Paleologos added that Buttigieg ""has found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders. All of this is happening while the number of undecided voters continues to grow as Democratic caucusgoers pause to reevaluate the changing field.""

BUTTIGIEG RETURNS FIRE AFTER AOC FUNDRAISING DIG

The survey – which has a has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 points -- also indicates Sen. Kamala Harris of California plunging 13 points from the June poll, which was conducted following Harris’ strong performance in the first round of primary debates.

The poll is the second piece of evidence pointing toward a post-debate bump for Buttigieg. He also raised $1.1 million in fundraising in the first 24-hours following the debate."

Speaking during a conference call with reporters, Zuckerberg said that he and Buttigieg have a number of mutual friends from college and that a number of his colleagues at Facebook had asked him to pass along their resumes to the South Bend, Ind. mayor in the hopes of obtaining a job on his presidential campaign.

“This should not be misconstrued as if I’m deeply involved in trying to support their campaign or something like that,” said Zuckerberg during the call.

WALLACE CHALLENGES BUTTIGIEG ON 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY'

Both Zuckerberg and Buttigieg attended Harvard University, with their time at the Ivy League school overlapping in 2003 and 2004. Buttigieg graduated in 2004. He majored in history and literature, while Zuckerberg famously dropped out of the school in his sophomore year.

Zuckerberg’s comments on advising the Buttigieg campaign came as the social media platform announced a presidential spending tracker, which will allow users on the site to see what regions candidates are targeting and if an ad ran on Facebook, Instagram, or Messenger.

The news also comes on the heels of what many have called Buttigieg’s best debate performance of the 2020 campaign season, with the normally stoic mayor showing rare outward fire by pointedly challenging Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on her health care plan and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, of Texas, on gun control.

""I don't mind being a little professorial at times,"" Buttigieg acknowledged in a conversation with reporters last month. He added, ""Sometimes I think I'm misread because I'm laid-back. I'm misread as being bloodless.""

Buttigieg’s debate performance saw him get a big boost in the polls, with a recent USA Today/Suffolk poll of Iowa caucus-goers showing him surpassing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for third place behind Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden.

Kurdish military leader says his fighters still want to work with US, accuses Turkey of 'violating' cease-fire, 'ethnic cleansing'

The Kurdish military leader who serves as commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces revealed to Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin in a telephone interview Sunday from his base inside Syria that Turkey’s military has “violated” the planned cease-fire and was continuing to commit “ethnic cleansing.” Speaking through a translator, Gen. Mazloum Abdi said he was “deeply disappointed” in President Trump over the withdrawal of U.S. troops in northern Syria, and claimed there’s still time for the U.S. to help the Kurds fighting for their lives.

Trump considering leaving small number of US troops in Syria: report

President Trump is mulling a plan to keep hundreds of U.S. troops in northeast Syria after most of American forces leave, reports say. The goal of this plan would be to prevent Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s troops or Russian forces from taking control of Syria’s oil fields, which are mainly in Kurdish-held territory in the northeast part of the country. It would also enable the military to retain a foothold in the fight against ISIS militants.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has opposed Trump's initial decision to withdraw all 1,000 U.S. troops in northeast Syria, presented the idea to the president last week, the Wall Street Journal reported. Graham said in an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he remains ""optimistic"" that ""historic solutions"" can still be reached on Syria.

""If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone -- and in fact, that's exactly the message they want to get across to you,"" Gabbard, a Democrat, said in the video.

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, took a series of shots at President Trump in an interview that aired Sunday, claiming that under his leadership, the U.S. was abandoning allied Kurdish fighters in Syria and that some of the president's rhetoric appealed to racism. Romney and Trump have feuded off-and-on over the years, with the president regularly saying that former governor of Massachusetts ""choked"" in his bid to unseat President Obama in 2012.

Warren says she'll reveal plan to pay for 'Medicare-for-all' soon, amid middle-class tax hike fears

Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" plan. The new 2020 Democratic frontrunner said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ""What I see … is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of 'Medicare-for-all,' and specifically how we pay for it.""

Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ""Medicare-for-all"" plans at $32-34 trillion. Warren came under attack from her 2020 White House rivals at last week's primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to pay for her proposal.

Last year, we saw actor Geoffrey Owens of ""The Cosby Show"" mocked for working at Trader Joe's. This time, the spotlight is on former NHL player Donald Brashear.

On Wednesday, Le Journal de Quebec detailed Brashear's new job serving customers at a local Tim Hortons. Brashear fell on hard times following his NHL career, both personal and financial, and it appears he is using this job to help get back on his feet and re-establish himself. This decision should be applauded, supported and championed, not fodder for gossip.

Brashear’s story is just one example of a concerning trend of blue-collar jobs being depicted as a low point in someone’s life, rather than an opportunity.

In February, Elizabeth Warren said her father ""ended up"" a janitor while she had more opportunities, insinuating that being a janitor was somehow below value, raising questions from voters across the country.

And in last week’s Democratic debate, Sen. Cory Booker paid lip service to the dignity of work, but his record doesn’t reflect someone who truly values it.

Booker, like Warren and many of their Democratic colleagues, supports liberal policies across the country that are designed to keep able-bodied adults out of work, including waivers and efforts against work requirements for able-bodied adults. With record-low unemployment and millions of job openings, there hasn’t been a better time in recent history to be a worker here in America. But instead of encouraging people to enter the workforce and empower them through work, we’re seeing them promote the alternative — dependency.

There is dignity in all work, and many pathways to success — but everyone has to start somewhere.

Our country’s story is a rich tapestry of men and women working their way up the economic ladder and boosting the next generation even higher than themselves. Many of our current and former leaders worked on farms, flipped burgers at McDonald’s (like former Speaker Paul Ryan), or were once on welfare (like Rep. Ted Yoho). I had my first taste of work babysitting in my early teens and then taught gymnastics and cheerleading through high school and college.

Our backgrounds are like millions of others across the country, and in each of these cases, working-class jobs weren’t what defined us as people. They were one part of our stories. After all, there is dignity in all work, and many pathways to success — but everyone has to start somewhere.

The more I think about it, the more I believe the piece on Brashear’s work at Tim Hortons was mislabeled. It isn’t a poor-me story of a man who fell from grace. It’s a comeback story, and an inspiration to people who feel like giving up when the life they thought they’d have didn’t go according to plan.

If our goal is to see people get through difficult life situations and past bad decisions and come out on the side of success, we cannot then shame them for their efforts to do so.

BUTTI-BOOM REDUX

USA Today: “It's a new three-way race in Iowa. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was initially seen as a long-shot presidential contender, has surged within striking distance of former vice president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll finds. … The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Biden at 18%, Warren at 17% and Buttigieg at 13% among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers. Those standings reflect significant changes since the Suffolk/USA TODAY poll taken in Iowa at the end of June, when Biden led Warren by double digits and Buttigieg trailed at a distant 6%. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who was then in second place after a strong showing in the first Democratic debate, has plummeted 13 percentage points and is now in a three-way tie for sixth. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned 9% support, the same number as in the June poll.”



Buttigieg, Klobuchar try to capitalize - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar shot out of the last Democratic debate with the most precious commodity a presidential candidate can get before the Iowa caucuses: momentum. … The new round of attention for both Midwesterners comes at a key moment: Klobuchar has yet to qualify for the November debate stage, while Buttigieg faced new questions about his campaign’s attention to racial issues. And both of them still have significant ground to make up in the polls. … Based on money and staff footprint, Buttigieg is better positioned: He ended September with $23.4 million in his campaign account — third in the Democratic field — while Klobuchar has $3.7 million to spend. She’s only reached 3 percent in one early-state poll, and she needs three more to qualify for the November debate. On the ground in Iowa, Buttigieg’s staff is about double the size of Klobuchar’s. Both candidates are currently airing TV ads in Iowa.”



Are Dems ready for a Midwest moment? - LAT: “Both long shots are now trying — with swings through early-voting states, new ads and endorsements, and intensified fundraising efforts — to keep their post-debate sizzle hot and find an opening in the contest that has been shaping up as a showdown between Biden and Warren. In the process, they are surfacing a long-simmering debate about the dominance of the party’s liberal wing on the East and West coasts — making a more pointed case than Biden, whose campaign pitch builds on his experience more than ideology. ‘It’s the Midwest versus the rest of the country,’ said Rufus Gifford, who was finance director of President Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012 and is uncommitted in the 2020 race. ‘Both Pete and Amy really focused on the fact that this is the part of the country we need to win, and we are losing.’”



Klobuchar says she’s peaking at the right time - WaPo: “Klobuchar, who struggled for attention in the Democratic primary, says this week's debate helped her catch on at exactly the right time. Her town halls are crowded, with staffers running to get more chairs to pack breweries or event centers. She leads the field in local endorsements, especially state legislators, ‘with more to come,’ she says. She kicked off her bus tour with the support of Andy McKean, a Republican state legislator who bolted his party six months ago and who pronounced Klobuchar the kind of Democrat who could unite America again. ‘If you want to peak in this race,’ she said after a stop in Waterloo, ‘you want to peak now, instead of six months before [the caucuses].’ A few other candidates still draw larger crowds, but Klobuchar is going for a particular kind of caucus-goer: the loyal Democrat who wants to win back those mysterious Trump voters.”



Zuckerberg gave hiring recommendations to Buttigieg campaign - Bloomberg: “Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has privately recommended several potential hires to Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, a rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech’s most powerful executives. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg’s campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring, campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed. Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg’s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.”

She added about the universal health insurance plan: ‘This is something I’ve been working on for months and months, and it’s got just a little more work until it’s finished.’”



Gabbard uses Hillary in bid for relevancy - Fox News: “Speaking directly to the camera in a video message posted on social media on Sunday, 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard suggested that Hillary Clinton recently ‘smeared’ her as a ‘Russian asset’ as payback for Gabbard's defiance of the party establishment in 2016. … [In the video Gabbard said,] ‘If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.’ … Several candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson, have criticized Clinton's unfounded suggestion that Russians have been ‘grooming’ Gabbard to be a third-party spoiler in the race.”

AP: “A crew of deep-sea explorers and historians looking for lost World War II warships have found a second Japanese aircraft carrier that went down in the historic Battle of Midway. Vulcan Inc.’s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high frequency sonar images of the warship Sunday and say that its dimensions and location mean it has to be the carrier Akagi. The Akagi was found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument resting in nearly 18,000 feet (5,490 meters) of water more than 1,300 miles (2,090 kilometers) northwest of Pearl Harbor. The researchers used an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, equipped with sonar to find the ship. The vehicle had been out overnight collecting data, and the image of a warship appeared in the first set of readings Sunday morning.”

MULVANEY AGONISTES

Politico: “Mick Mulvaney’s week went from bad to worse on Sunday, as he again tried to explain why President Donald Trump and the administration had withheld aid to Ukraine for weeks — one of Democrats’ central questions in their impeachment inquiry. Mulvaney fumbled during an interview on ‘Fox News Sunday’ when he cited two reasons for the delay, whereas he had listed three during his Thursday news briefing at the White House. He continued to blame reporters for any misunderstanding, a feat that can be tough to pull off when his answers were all delivered on camera and when the host, Chris Wallace, let the tape keep rolling. And he threw red meat to liberals and Democratic presidential candidates who have long questioned the appropriateness of the Trump family continuing to profit from their business holdings while Trump serves as president. … Mulvaney’s interview did not play well among Trump allies and advisers, with one calling it a ‘self-immolation.’”



Party support for Trump gets tested - WSJ: “President Trump faces increasing public and private scrutiny from his own party over a series of recent White House moves, as the House impeachment inquiry reduces his margin for error with fellow Republicans and makes him more vulnerable to attacks. In the past several days, Mr. Trump has been forced to drop plans to host next year’s Group of Seven summit at his Doral golf resort, and a top aide has tried to walk back comments linking Ukraine military aid to an investigation of the president’s political opponents. The fallout of Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has continued to draw widespread criticism, including from Republicans. Mr. Trump’s support within his party will face fresh tests this week, as key witnesses from the State Department and Pentagon are expected to testify in closed hearings before a trio of House committees on the president’s dealings with Ukraine.”



Continetti: Trump fatigue syndrome - National Review: “I was surprised to read Robert J. Samuelson’s column in the Washington Post arguing for the impeachment and removal of President Trump. Samuelson is, above all, a realist who has looked on economics and politics with a tough and somewhat cynical eye for some 30 years. … Samuelson has reached his breaking point. And he isn’t alone. A large part of the country suffers from Trump Fatigue Syndrome. This is related but not identical to Trump Derangement Syndrome. The sufferers of Trump Fatigue aren’t driven mad by the president. They are just tired of having to wake up every morning to another of his sudden attacks, reversals, exaggerations, and boasts. They want the show to end.”



Dems ready more witnesses for impeachment probe - Reuters: “Democrats on Monday laid out their case for the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump and pressed Republicans to stop supporting Trump by releasing a fact sheet and video they said expose Trump’s efforts to secure victory in the 2020 presidential election with the assistance of Ukraine. The releases ‘encapsulate all the evidence uncovered to date about the president’s months-long pressure campaign to undermine the 2020 election and the extent to which he abused his power by using the levers of government to advance the scheme,’ according to the office of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives. They also showed how Democrats may approach the charges, or articles of impeachment, they are expected to draw up at the conclusion of the probe. The articles of impeachment, if approved by the House, would then be sent to Senate for a trial on whether to remove Trump from office.”



TRUMP OVERWHELMS DEMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

NYT: “That campaigns are now being fought largely online is hardly a revelation, yet only one political party seems to have gotten the message. While the Trump campaign has put its digital operation firmly at the center of the president’s re-election effort, Democrats are struggling to internalize the lessons of the 2016 race and adapt to a political landscape shaped by social media. Mr. Trump’s first campaign took far better advantage of Facebook and other platforms that reward narrowly targeted — and, arguably, nastier — messages. And while the president is now embattled on multiple fronts and disfavored by a majority of Americans in most polls, he has one big advantage: His 2020 campaign, flush with cash, is poised to dominate online again, according to experts on both ends of the political spectrum, independent researchers and tech executives. The difference between the parties’ digital efforts, they said, runs far deeper than the distinction between an incumbent’s general-election operation and challengers’ primary campaigns.”



Dems also worry about Trump’s money machine - Politico: “Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee have raised more than $300 million this year for his reelection — more than any other sitting president in history at this point in the campaign. Trump has nearly twice as much cash on hand — $158 million, between his campaign account and the RNC — as Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this time in his successful re-election run. … Democrats, meanwhile, are still four or five months away — at the earliest — from settling on a nominee. ‘We don’t know if the Democratic candidate is going to be able to even compete with such a shorter timeline, even if they have significant resources after the convention,’ said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive officer of the progressive group ACRONYM. With the Democratic primary in full swing, McGowan said, ‘There’s two separate elections going on, and the really unfortunate part is Trump is the only one involved in the general election today.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I've a sad sense of déjà vu: 2020 is shaping up to be another election which leaves no major candidate for whom I can vote. As a conservative, I had serious concerns about Trump's temperament but was long done with the Clintons’ modus operandi. Now I face a similar situation: Vote for someone who, against all military advice and in one stroke, abruptly abandoned allies in the field to danger and death and diminished (if not killed outright) our chances of creating such alliances in the future, or vote for a socialist. As for David Brooks ‘policies can be argued about and reversed,’ in what world? I can think of quite a few bad policies that have never been reversed, amended or fixed because once created, they spawn dependent bureaucracies and constituencies. Attempt to touch them and you'll meet Paul Ryan's fate. Worse, voting for a Democrat lends legitimacy to the vicious, hateful behavior displayed toward Brett Kavanaugh and the underhanded, partisan impeachment inquiry. (Impeachment is a political process, but as you've pointed out, it wasn't intended to be a partisan one.) Many Republican Senators might prefer to remove him, have Pence and peace and be done with it. (Sounds good to me.) But how many will be able to bring themselves to vote for removal, thereby legitimizing a process that locked out their House counterparts? It's growing very grey days in voter land.” – Triche Osborne, Baton Rouge, La.



[Ed. note: I hear you! Another few weeks like the ones we’ve had and I may seek out an island in the Aleutians to live out my days with the polar bears. But… We are very privileged to be alive in this moment. Life, especially as free people, is always a privilege, but how lucky are we to be alive at a moment when America, the West, and really, our whole species is fundamentally re-evaluating what it’s all about. I choose not to despair because history tells me that we will figure it out. Maybe not in a straight line, but we will get there. I base this not on the fact that there is an arc to history (there isn’t) but rather because we have all of the necessary ingredients to make what comes next freer, fairer and more dedicated the American creed.]



“As you note, there are many indicators supporting your observation that we are in the midst of enormous societal and hence political change. But I would dispute your conclusion that no politician is addressing this change. Andrew Yang had built his campaign explicitly around this change which he believes will accelerate over the next two decades. I am disappointed that you and the rest of the political press have paid so little attention. You may well not agree with his prescriptions, but he has clearly diagnosed the disease and deserves serious consideration. In the last debate, I was struck by his quiet observation about Sweden's wealth tax proposal - it has been tried by several other developed nations and failed - adding - why can't we learn from the experience of others?” – Matt Lincoln, Portola Valley, Calif.



[Ed. note: Yang may be prescient, Mr. Lincoln, but he also is a pessimist. One of the reasons he has connected so well with younger males is that he matches the sense of foreboding common among many millennial dudes. I do grant you that he is one of the few candidates who is even talking about this Gutenberg-level (Johannes not Steve) disruption that’s working its way through our society. I wish politicians in both parties would think about the same stuff.]



“Well I live in the UK and I am 72 years old, but I watch and read Fox News every day without fail… Before Trump decided to run for President I loved this man to death, he is just what I wanted to see in a President of the USA. Today at times I cringe when Trump opens his mouth or goes off on one on Twitter, he is the making of all his problems to date… Now I want Trump to get a 2nd term but he must CONTROL his mouth and have more respect for people who he talks to after all this is the most powerful man on planet Earth…” – Michael O'Connor, West Yorkshire, England

YA BASIC

AP: “A BASE jumper who jumped illegally from a northwestern Wisconsin cellphone tower ended up calling the police on himself after his parachute became caught on a guy wire, leaving him dangling perilously 50 feet (15 meters) from the ground. Police say the 20-year-old man jumped from the 300-foot (90-meter) Charter Communications tower in Menomonie on Thursday morning. After his rescue at around 9:30 a.m., the man was treated at Mayo Clinic Health System and arrested for criminal trespass. BASE jumping stands for building, antenna, span and earth — the four common objects from which BASE jumpers launch their descent.”

Kennedy to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to mock President Trump's recent, casually worded missive to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but the Twitter mockery quickly blew back in Clinton's face, with commentators across the political spectrum suggesting the former secretary of state shouldn't relish so openly in Twitter trolling.

What's more, users quickly noted that Clinton's team had lifted the letter, without attribution, from a segment on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" that aired this past Wednesday night.

The kerfuffle came as Clinton's feud with Tulsi Gabbard has prompted speculation that she might enter the presidential race — and a dare from Gabbard to do just that.

""Dear Premier Kruschev,"" the mock letter ""from the archives"" during the Cuban Missile Crisis began, ""Don't be a d--k, ok? Get your missiles out of Cuba. ... Give you a jingle later. Hugs.""

In his Oct. 9 letter to Erdoğan, first obtained by the Fox Business Network's Trish Regan, Trump adopted a similarly familiar tone.

""Let's work out a good deal!"" Trump began. ""You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy - and I will. I've already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson."" Brunson was held as a prisoner in Turkey for two years before the Trump administration secured his release.

GABBARD REVEALS WHY CLINTON'S COMING AFTER HER

Trump continued: ""Don't let the world down. ... History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool. I will call you later.""

Sources close to Erdoğan told the BBC Thursday that the Turkish strongman ""thoroughly rejected"" the letter. Erdoğan reportedly took the letter warning against being a ""fool"" and tossed it ""in the bin,"" the sources said.

But Clinton's jab itself inspired a slew of mockery — including a post that highlighted Clinton's October 2016 tweet, featuring a photo of herself as a little girl with the caption: ""Happy birthday to this future president.""

The Washington Examiner's Jerry Dunleavy flagged that the letter had appeared on Jimmy Kimmel's show. The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler remarked dryly, ""Sometimes silence is golden.""

Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser Lara Trump earlier this month welcomed a possible Clinton presidential run in 2020, saying she was confident the president would defeat Clinton again.

""First of all, I just want to double down on the president and say if Hillary Clinton would like round two with Donald Trump, please let's do that,"" the wife of the president's son Eric Trump said on ""Hannity.""

""I would love to see a 'round two' between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton because I think we all remember, Sean, not too long ago, all the media said that she was going to be the next president. We see Donald Trump in the White House now.""

Clinton herself had sparked a wave of speculation about a possible run with a pointed Oct. 8 tweet.

Robert ""Beto"" O’Rourke plays it cool with slang: ""It’s Gonna Take All of Us.""

Clearly the polls say Americans want to feel like they are part of the team. Inclusive. A musical montage from a teen movie where everyone chips in and they save the day. But don’t be fooled: These candidates are not like you, and the policies they support are actually bad for regular Americans. In fact, their slogans should all be the same: ""Do as I say, not as I do.""

Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to being green.

TUCKER CARLSON: POLS WHO USE KIDS TO GAIN POWER MAY BE A GREATER 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' THAN CLIMATE CHANGE?

As part of their required Federal Election Commission quarterly filings, the candidates disclosed how their finances and each campaign have been spending a lot of money on private jet travel. After all, how else does one get from Iowa to New Hampshire? In coach? Taking off shoes at TSA? With campaign donations picking up the tab, private jets make the campaign trail much better.

For a collective group of Democrats who decry fossil fuels, who embrace the radical Green New Deal, who demand we change our habits and diets to reflect the “existential crisis” of climate change, they sure don’t put their campaign money with their mouth is.

Every one of the 2020 candidates supports the Green New Deal (GND) as part of their campaign, and as a reminder, this radical, socialist proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seeks to make air travel ""obsolete."" Air travel is such a no-no amongst environmentalists that ""flight shaming"" has become a common tactic the green radicals use.

So, why do these candidates get a pass? If they want us to stop flying commercial, why are they justified in flying private?

The Buttigieg campaign said it needs private jets because South Bend isn't convenient to campaign stops and the mayor has a vigorous schedule. Here’s a question for Mayor Pete: If I live in rural America and am busy, can I get an exemption under the Green New Deal you support?

We all know the answer to that question, plebeian.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., say their flights are actually ""carbon neutral"" because they buy carbon offsets, presumably with campaign contributions. That's like justifying a cheesecake for dinner by purchasing my neighbor a treadmill. For his dog. And the treadmill company donates to my campaign. Yet, in the silly and slimy world of D.C. politics and sympathetic press, somehow that excuse evens out.

All these candidates are too cowardly to admit what we all know: They travel on private jets because they can. Playing us for fools just adds insult to injury.

Their private air travel is possible for one reason, and one reason alone: America is great. Right now, there are millions of Americans in rural places like Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and Artesia, New Mexico, working in the energy industry. These are the men and women who power America doing hard, difficult, even dangerous work, and we all benefit from the fruit of their labor.

We have an incredible amount of oil and gas reserves across this nation, and many are still yet untapped. Our abundant energy means prices are low. A decade ago, oil consistently hovered around $100 a barrel. Today, it is half that. This means cheaper gas and home utility bills. Information technology is reflected in the manufacturing and shipping costs of consumer goods. Abundant energy means we spend less. This is something we should celebrate.

What happens when the Green New Deal does make air travel ""obsolete"" and the 10 million American jobs in the airline industry are lost? What happens when Sanders gets his wish to make fracking illegal by executive order and consequently half our oil and two-thirds our gas comes off the market?

I’ll tell you what happens: You won't fly home for Christmas. You won't buy fruit in winter. Cold weather and athletic clothing with lycra and Core-Tex and nylon won’t be affordable. Food prices will skyrocket. Shipping costs will make European goods unaffordable, and speaking of Europe, forget about going. You can't afford it, because with oil around $200 a barrel, even a cruise is out of the question.

What happens when politicians destroy the fossil fuel industry is, they destroy the economy and our way of life.

Next time you see a candidate in a stump speech decrying climate change, demanding a Green New Deal, even calling energy industry workers ""Criminals,"" just ask a simple question: Will you, candidate, stop using these fossil fuels, the cheap gas, the plastics, the oil, the private jets, in your campaign?

We all know the answer to that, plebeian.

Any candidate who does not live in his private life what he wants government to mandate you live in yours is not worthy of your vote to elected office. And none of these hypocrites is worthy to be your president.

Tulsi Gabbard of being a Russian agent. Or, words to that effect.

More accurately, in a podcast hosted by former Obama apparatchik David Plouffe, Clinton said candidate Gabbard is “the favorite of the Russians” and suggested Moscow was supporting her bid through fake social media postings.

Since Gabbard is only polling at 1.2 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average, Russia doesn’t seem to be helping much. More important, there is zero evidence that any such meddling has occurred.

BRUCE ASHFORD: BETO'S ATTACK ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY NOT JUST WRONG BUT DISASTROUS — HERE ARE FOUR REASONS WHY

What on earth could have prompted such an outlandish charge? We can start with Clinton’s enduring belief that the Russians were behind her 2016 defeat, in addition to James Comey, misogyny, Bernie Sanders, the Electoral College, the media and innumerable other villains. Hillary has never owned up to having been a widely distrusted, politically inept and arrogant candidate who simply lost an election.

It’s unfortunate, because her inability to take responsibility for the unexpected 2016 loss has helped divide the country and has also made her a laughing stock. Unlike most former candidates, Hillary has seen her approval ratings drop since her campaign, and especially among Democrats. In September 2018, two years after the election, Clinton’s approval stood at 36 percent, an all-time low, and seven points below her ratings on the cusp of the 2016 vote. Among Democrats, her approval was down 11 points.

After 17 years of being voted the most admired woman in the country, Hillary has fallen behind Michelle Obama and is tied with Melania Trump. Boy, that must rankle.

Blame her interminable and whiny book, endless embarrassing speaking tours meant to keep her in the public eye and fluff up her already-copious bank account, and renewed scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation, which, not surprisingly, deflated as donors disappeared.

But mainly, blame her inability to move on, which has prompted her peculiar attack on Gabbard. The animus between the two is not new; in 2016, Gabbard committed the unforgivable sin of endorsing Bernie Sanders. At the time, Gabbard was vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, which has been accused of tipping the primary contest to Hillary. Her apostasy, consequently, was profound.

Some have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm.

Gabbard has also challenged Hillary, and the Democratic establishment, on foreign policy. When the Iraq war veteran came out in favor of Bernie, Gabbard described Hillary as someone who “will lead us into more interventionist wars of regime change.”

Gabbard has fired back at Clinton’s Russia comments, calling her the “queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long….”

Gabbard claims her camp has detected a “concerted campaign to destroy my reputation” and now believes that Hillary, “through her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose” is behind that effort.

The assertion seems far-fetched; why would Hillary Clinton bother to take down a fellow Democrat who is so far behind the pack?

Maybe because in her bitterness Hillary cannot endure anyone else – and especially another female – campaigning and possibly winning in 2020.

Gabbard has suggested as much, tweeting “It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me… Join the race directly.”

Some have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm. Like many Democrats, she may consider Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is quickly becoming the favorite, too extreme to win a national election against Donald Trump.

In a recent interview with PBS’ Judy Woodruff, Clinton said, ""So maybe there does need to be a re-match. I mean, obviously I can beat him again."" She later said she was joking.

Recently, baited to jump in by President Trump on Twitter Hillary responded “Don’t tempt me. Do your job.”

Before she enters the race, Hillary should review what voters are saying about another run. A recent Rasmussen poll shows that fully 71 percent of voters say she should not run, including 58 percent of her own party. That’s not a great starting point.

Though Hillary is quite positive she would win, suggesting in a CBS interview that “there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again,” the Rasmussen survey tells a different story.

In that poll, she ties Trump in a head-to-head match-up. But remember that on the eve of the 2016 election the polling was unequivocally in her favor. At that time The Daily Beast posted a jubilant column, “Hillary Clinton Leads All Final Polls,” noting a Monmouth poll had the former Secretary of State up by 6 points, while a tracking poll by ABC News and the Washington Post had her ahead by 4 points. It may be, given the apparent bias in Trump surveys, that running even is not good enough.

Three other findings should give her pause. The first is that in that imaginary contest, Clinton wins only 60 percent of the black vote. In 2016, she walked away with 88 percent of that vote. That possible leakage of black votes, which I’ve noted before, is a real danger sign for Hillary, and for Democrats.

Second, only 42 percent of those surveyed think the country would be better off today if Clinton had been elected. Fully 48 percent disagree. That’s an astonishing conclusion, given the daily battering the president receives from the media and his low job approval ratings.

Finally, only 54 percent of Democrats think Hillary won the nomination in 2016 fairly. Imagine the reaction is she was to jump in today, or if she were to be nominated by a deadlocked convention. The remaining dozen or so candidates, and their supporters, would erupt; most likely, a great many would stay home.

It’s time for Hillary to retire to the sidelines. Stop embarrassing Democrats, and herself.

* The U.S. Supreme Court this morning “threw out a challenge” to Michigan’s gerrymandered legislative map. As Reuters reported, the high court’s action “voided an order in April by a three-judge panel to rework 34 districts in the state legislature and U.S. House of Representatives whose boundaries were crafted purely to advantage Republicans.”

* A new Suffolk/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats shows a competitive presidential nominating contest, with Joe Biden narrowly leading Elizabeth Warren, 18% to 17%, with Pete Buttigieg not far behind with 13%. Bernie Sanders slipped to fourth in this poll, with 9% support.

* Also of interest, Amy Klobuchar was at 3% in the poll – she’s tied for fifth place – which I think will help move the Minnesota Democrat closer to qualifying for next month’s presidential primary debate.

* Speaking of Minnesota, a new Star Tribune poll found Donald Trump trailing each of the top Democratic contenders in 2020 match-ups. Despite the president’s recent insistence that he expects to win Minnesota next year, the poll showed him trailing Warren by nine points, Biden by 12 points, and Klobuchar by 17 points.

* On the heels of Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) suggesting he’d consider supporting Trump’s impeachment, the Florida Republican announced he’ll retire after just two terms in the U.S. House.

* The day after acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said, “Get over it” after acknowledging the White House’s quid-pro-quo scheme with Ukraine, Trump’s re-election campaign began selling t-shirts with the same phrase.

* Julian Castro’s presidential campaign announced this morning that the former House secretary will end his presidential bid without an additional $800,000 in donations over the next 10 days. Of course, even if the Texas Democrat gets the money, he’s still not yet close to meeting the polling threshold for next month’s primary debate.

* Bernie Sanders returned to the campaign trail over the weekend, holding a massive rally in New York alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). It was his first such event since the Vermont senator’s heart attack earlier this month.

* And Hillary Clinton suggested late last week that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a 2020 presidential candidate, would receive Russian support for running as a third-party candidate next year. The congresswoman responded by blasting Clinton as corrupt and “the queen of warmongers.” Gabbard also appeared on Friday night on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program to respond to the Democratic Party’s 2016 nominee."

""Odd lot"" trades — or stock trades involving fewer than 100 shares — are becoming more commonplace, making up nearly half of all trades in early October, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited New York Stock Exchange data.

The shift has been driven by a steady rise in average share prices and surging popularity of algorithmic trading.

Trading programs often cut large exchanges into smaller segments spread out over time, and expensive stocks require more cash for high-volume trades.

The shift from round-lot trades — those made in multiples of 100 shares — could require new market regulation, as odd-lot trades aren't shown on public data feeds and aren't used in exchanges' best price quotes.

""Odd lot"" trades — stock purchases or sales involving fewer than 100 shares — now make up nearly half of all trades after doubling since 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing New York Stock Exchange data.

The small trades were previously a small segment of all stock transfers, making up just over 20% of trades five years ago. Yet an increase in high-price stocks and automated trading programs drove a surge in odd-lot exchanges. The proportion of trades in that size reached a record 48.9% on October 7 and has stayed above 40% since, according to WSJ.

While no S&P 500 companies traded above $1,000 per share in 2012, five now do, including Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet. The record-long bull market has inflated the rest of the market, with the average price of stocks in the S&P 500 more than tripling since 2009, according to Strategas Research data cited by WSJ.

The move to higher prices leads investors to have to hand over more upfront for trades involving multiples of 100 shares, also known as ""round lot"" trades.

The influx of technology and programming into the once trader-dominated stock market has also driven up the popularity of odd-lot exchanges.

Algorithmic trading often divides large sales or purchases into smaller segments to spread out a trade and avoid a large price change that could alert other investors. Though banks used to cut large trades into round-lot exchanges, they're increasingly using odd-lot trades for segmented orders, according to WSJ.

""We now live in a world of algos and slicing and dicing,"" Cornell University finance professor Maureen O'Hara told WSJ.

The shift from round-lot trades presents a few issues in the slow-to-change world of market regulation. For instance, odd-lot quotes aren't shown on public data feeds, allowing the small trades to go hidden from many investors' fields of view.

Brokers also face challenges born from the shift to odd-lots. The firms are obligated to execute trades at the best price posted on an exchange, but the prices are taken only by round-lot quotes. Best price quotes could become less accurate if the trend continues, as odd-lot trades would account for more of a stock's price movement.

Elizabeth Warren is known as the candidate with the plans, but Senate colleague and presidential nomination rival Sen. Cory Booker begs to differ.

“There’s no bigger policy wonk nerd in this race than me. Anybody who knows me in the Senate, that’s my forte,” Booker, D-N.J., highlighted Monday in an interview with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com.

Booker, who was interviewed aboard his campaign’s New Hampshire RV, emphasized that “there’s been 170-180 plans put out by every candidate. We’re all putting out plans. I love mine. I think in so many cases my plans are better. Heck, we are the only people to put out a plan on child poverty. How can that be?”

WARREN SAYS SHE'LL UNVEIL HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR HER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL PLAN

And, he indirectly took aim at Warren, D-Mass., who’s soared in recent months to a tie with former Vice President Joe Biden for the top spot in the 2020 primary race.

“I stand with Elizabeth Warren. I think ‘Medicare-for-all’ is the best way to do it. But, I also actually believe that it’s going to be a process to get there,” Booker noted. “We can’t be in a situation where we’re just talking away insurance from folks.”

Warren has been a major supporter of the “Medicare-for-all” plan introduced in the Senate by 2020 rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. The government-run plan, if enacted, would eliminate private insurance.

Booker, spotlighting his pragmatism, added, “I will not be one of those folks on the stage that’s so rigid to say, ‘It’s my way or the highway and I’m going to sacrifice progress for purity. I’m going to let perfect be the enemy of the good,’ when every American needs more good.”

Asked if some of his nomination rivals were too rigid, Booker answered, “that’s what voters are going to have to decide.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren came under repeated attack at last week’s fourth-round primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for middle-class Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run “Medicare-for-all” plan. She announced Sunday that she would soon reveal how the country would pay for it if she were president.

Booker has built up a formidable team in New Hampshire and Iowa, the first two states to vote in the caucus and primary calendar. Analysts have called him a skilled retail campaigner and arguably the best orator in the record-setting field of presidential contenders. But, he’s yet to pop in the polls or have many viral moments.

However, with three and a half months to go until the voting begins, that’s fine with Booker.

“The people that usually win are the people who peak in January, February, not people who are winning in the summer or winning in the fall. We’ve just got to continue doing the work,” he noted.

And, pointing to one-time longshots who ended up winning the nomination and eventually the White House, he said, “the more people who hear my message, the more [success] and momentum we’re getting and I’m hoping that continues to rise. And, by the time we’re in next year, I hope we’ll do what Bill Clinton, the comeback kid, or Jimmy Carter – who won New Hampshire – I’ll follow in their footsteps.”"

My life experience made me a Republican. Growing up I witnessed firsthand the poverty and destruction government policies had on my people and my peoples’ land -- the Indian reservation.

Overlapping, paternalistic federal and state programs, including fully funded and inefficient healthcare, dominate the reservations’ economies. The restrictions the government places on land use, ownership and business development are microcosms of socialist failure in its purest form.

The government “help” has never encouraged financial self-sufficiency. If anything, the programs have been a disincentive to economic freedom and prosperity.

While I firmly believe all Americans should benefit from a safety net, I also know government handouts are never as powerful as a hand up. The federal government set up the reservations more than 100 years ago and, just like liberal democrats today, created these subsidized economies because they think they know what’s best for us.

The result of more than 100 years of government assistance is Indian Reservations drowning in poverty. These well-intended programs have made our people the poorest Americans. Some reservations have unemployment rates close to 85 percent, and 29 percent of employed Native Americans nationwide live below the poverty level.

To improve peoples’ lives we can’t force them to rely on the government. Tax cuts and the free-market economy foster growth and opportunity, creating jobs and lifting the poor out of poverty.

Is it a perfect system? No, but to see more families prosper and have better opportunities, free-market economic policies, especially tax cuts, are proven to work. Socialist government-controlled economies, with handouts and higher taxes, only lead to poverty and misery.

Today, the U.S. unemployment rate is at its the lowest point in 50 years. The jobless rate for Hispanics hit a record low of 3.9 percent in September. African Americans maintained their lowest rate ever at 5.5 percent and adult women came in at 3.1 percent.

Warren, one of the leading Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020, spoke to reporters Monday after an event at Roosevelt High school in Des Moines, Iowa, when the topic of “Medicare-for-all” was raised.

During the media gaggle, Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked Warren: “How should caucus-goers be confident it is possible to pay for 'Medicare-for-all’ at all if the leading Democratic candidate still needs a few more weeks to tell them how it is going to get paid for?”

In response, Warren replied: “Well, why don’t you ask me that when the plan is out.”

POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE

She did not give any further details.

Warren has been criticized in recent weeks for not explaining exactly how she would cover the costs for her ambitious plan, with two fellow 2020 contenders taking issue with her during last week’s debate.

After being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate in Ohio last Tuesday whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health0care proposal, the progressive senator didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging, “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Moments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who’s soared in polling in recent months and has been considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden.

ELIZABETH WARREN APPARENTLY SCRUBS DNA-TEST ROLLOUT FROM CAMPAIGN SITE, TWITTER

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this 'Medicare-for-all’ plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Warren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: “Let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,’ understand what that means: It’s 'Medicare for all who can afford it,’ and that’s the problem we’ve got. 'Medicare-for-all’ is the gold standard.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren.

The Minnesota Democrat said, “At least [Bernie Sanders is] being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up, and I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

Suggesting that Warren would never be able to pass her 'Medicare-for-all’ plan through Congress, Klobuchar said: “The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.”

Biden also chimed in, jabbing at Warren without naming her, accusing her of not being straightforward.

“On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it’s awfully important to be straightforward with them,” Biden noted. “The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.”

Elizabeth Warren once railed against class warfare and defended the rich in an op-ed she penned way back in 2004 -- a column that underscores her striking transformation over the years into a leading antagonist of the so-called ""1 percent.""

The op-ed, titled “The Vital Middle,” was published on July 16, 2004, as part of a special report from The American Prospect on then-Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.

ELISA MARTINEZ: IF WARREN UNDERSTOOD NATIVE AMERICANS, SHE'D KNOW SOCIALISM DOESN'T WORK

The Massachusetts Democrat, who was a Harvard Law School professor at the time, used the piece to offer advice to Kerry. Some of the viewpoints are familiar—like going after corporate welfare and pushing health insurance for all—but others seem far more moderate than Warren’s current attitude toward the wealthy.

“It is not about class warfare,” Warren wrote. “The rich are not the enemy—in fact, most of us would like to be rich.”

“Corruption and misplaced priorities are the enemy. And the poor are not the only ones who have problems, so don’t talk as if they are the only ones who deserve compassion,” she continued.

“Americans risk fracturing into disparate groups, jealously guarding whatever benefits we have gained, pursuing separate identities instead of the country’s shared identity as part of one great American middle class,” she wrote. “That makes us nervous. Lead from the middle, because a middle-focused agenda helps all Americans, including our poor and our wealthy.”

In the piece, Warren went on to share somewhat of a Republican talking point -- blasting ""welfare cheats,"" while also maintaining her familiar stance of fighting against ""corporate welfare"" that favors ""well-connected mega-businesses and political friends.""

""Stand for fair play--not handouts, not special interests--just plain, old-fashioned, everyone-plays-by-the-same- rules,"" she wrote. ""Reject welfare cheats, corporate cheats, or cheats of any other stripe. Speak to us of fundamental fairness, and we will believe again in what we can be.""

But fast-forward to the present—and Warren, who is now a leader in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, has changed her tune.

One of her core policies is a wealth tax -- a 2 percent annual tax on the wealth of individuals with more than $50 million, and a 3 percent tax on the wealth of those with over $1 billion.

She said during last week's Democratic primary debate that ""taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does,"" and added that ""the rich are not like you and me.""

Warren sharply criticized the wealthy at the debate, saying ""the way we're going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they're making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind.""

Warren critics cited the 2004 op-ed as a sign of inconsistency.

""Yet more evidence of Elizabeth Warren being dishonest and disingenuous about her record? What a shock,"" a Trump campaign official said.

""'Welfare cheats' is a Republican talking point that does violence to people--particularly communities of color--who have been failed by the corporate-dominated policies that Senator Warren apparently had an epiphany about not that long ago,"" a Democratic strategist told Fox News. ""We deserve a nominee who's been committed to systematic change for their entire career.""

When she announced her 2020 candidacy, Warren also said it was time to ""fight back"" against the wealthy.

Her campaign has not responded to a Fox News request for comment on the 2004 piece.

Warren, meanwhile, would qualify as wealthy herself, with a reported net worth of $12 million."

""It’s a soundbite. And more than that... it’s not based on common sense.""

JOE SCARBOROUGH: THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR ELIZABETH WARREN'S PROMISES

Bennet accused Warren and the other 2020 candidates of misrepresenting Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., original ""Medicare-for-All"" plan and said they are relying on lofty ideals and naivete to save America's health care system.

""I’ve been saying that for months that everybody except Bernie is lying about Bernie’s plan,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""Bernie wrote Medicare-for-all. Bernie has said that it will cost $31 trillion. He’s come up with 16 of that 31 trillion dollars. That’s half.""

""And he does that by taxing people that are making less than $30,000 a year,"" Bennett continued. ""But at least he’s being honest about his plan. Others that have signed on have said sort of magically, this will all take care of itself.""

WALLACE CHALLENGES BUTTIGIEG ON 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY'

Buttigieg -- who served in the U.S. Naval Reserve in the Afghanistan War and would be the nation’s first openly gay president if elected -- was up seven percentage points since the previous Suffolk University/USA Today poll in Iowa, in June.

The new poll was conducted Wednesday through Friday, entirely after last Tuesday’s fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate. Political pundits gave a more aggressive Buttigieg high marks for taking on Warren over how she’d pay for her Medicare-for-all health care plan, targeting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over her anti-interventionist stance, and clashing with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke over his mandatory gun buy back proposal.

Buttigieg was followed in the poll by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who stood at 9 percent.

""Iowa is unquestionably up for grabs,"" Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said.

Paleologos added that Buttigieg ""has found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders. All of this is happening while the number of undecided voters continues to grow as Democratic caucusgoers pause to reevaluate the changing field.""

BUTTIGIEG RETURNS FIRE AFTER AOC FUNDRAISING DIG

The survey – which has a has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 points -- also indicates Sen. Kamala Harris of California plunging 13 points from the June poll, which was conducted following Harris’ strong performance in the first round of primary debates.

The poll is the second piece of evidence pointing toward a post-debate bump for Buttigieg. He also raised $1.1 million in fundraising in the first 24-hours following the debate."

Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.

GABBARD REVEALS WHY SHE THINKS CLINTON IS 'SMEARING' HER

""Tulsi Gabbard, much like President Trump, does not take guff from anyone and, unlike many of her Democratic cohorts and competitors, she refuses to kiss the Clinton ring,"" continued Lahren on her show ""Final Thoughts.""

Clinton kicked off a fight with Gabbard by suggesting that the Army National Guard major, who served two tours in the Middle East, is secretly in league with the Russian government.

TRUMP DEFENDS GABBARD, SUGGESTS CLINTON IS 'SICK'

Appearing on the podcast of a former aide to President Barack Obama, Clinton said, in remarks widely interpreted to be in reference to Gabbard, ""I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians.""

""This, coming from Ms. Crooked, email-deleting, Benghazi lying, pay-for-play Clinton Foundation, failed Russia restart, Hillary Clinton?"" remarked Lahren. ""For her to accuse anybody of being crooked, corrupt, or anything of the sort is so unbelievably tone-deaf and painfully ironic.""

""It’s no question Hillary has it out for Tulsi. The question is why,"" she continued.

""First, Hillary is the leader of the war hawk war party,"" offered Lahren. ""She, along with many neocon Republicans, has been a cheerleader for endless conflict, foreign intervention and the very regime change wars that Tulsi Gabbard rallies against.""

""Secondly,"" said Lahren, ""Hillary may still have bad blood with her over the 2016 Bernie Sanders endorsement. Hillary holding a grudge? Shocking, I know.""

However, Lahren said that she believes the most significant factor driving Clinton to attempt to undermine Gabbard is that ""Tulsi will not fall in line.""

TRUMP REIGNITES FEUD WITH HILLARY CLINTON

""Tulsi is the only Democratic contender willing to directly call out Hillary and the Clinton dynasty. The Clinton regime does not tolerate dissent. They do not tolerate Democrats who don’t fall in line.""

In response to Clinton's accusation, Gabbard tweeted at the former first lady, calling her ""the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long...""

""Even Elizabeth Warren falls in line,"" alleged Lahren.

Indeed, Newsweek reported, ""Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, both tier-one candidates, have remained largely silent on the issue."" Additionally, the Biden campaign outright declined to comment on Clinton's remarks on Monday.

In the most pointed response yet, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., tweeted, ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset."" Notably, Sanders did not mention Clinton by name.

STU VARNEY: TRUMP SPEECH IN NATURAL HAS-RICH STATE MAY TURN THE TABLES ON DEMOCRATS

""I don’t know if she’s truly cozy with the Russians or not, but I for damn sure believe it’s her refusal to be cozy with the Clintons that has incurred the wrath of Hillary,"" said Lahren.

""The good news for Tulsi is, outside of the establishment elites, the D.C. beltway brats and the swamp — no one cares what Hillary has to say,"" she concluded.

Speaking during a conference call with reporters, Zuckerberg said that he and Buttigieg have a number of mutual friends from college and that a number of his colleagues at Facebook had asked him to pass along their resumes to the South Bend, Ind. mayor in the hopes of obtaining a job on his presidential campaign.

“This should not be misconstrued as if I’m deeply involved in trying to support their campaign or something like that,” said Zuckerberg during the call.

WALLACE CHALLENGES BUTTIGIEG ON 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY'

Both Zuckerberg and Buttigieg attended Harvard University, with their time at the Ivy League school overlapping in 2003 and 2004. Buttigieg graduated in 2004. He majored in history and literature, while Zuckerberg famously dropped out of the school in his sophomore year.

Zuckerberg’s comments on advising the Buttigieg campaign came as the social media platform announced a presidential spending tracker, which will allow users on the site to see what regions candidates are targeting and if an ad ran on Facebook, Instagram, or Messenger.

The news also comes on the heels of what many have called Buttigieg’s best debate performance of the 2020 campaign season, with the normally stoic mayor showing rare outward fire by pointedly challenging Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on her health care plan and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, of Texas, on gun control.

""I don't mind being a little professorial at times,"" Buttigieg acknowledged in a conversation with reporters last month. He added, ""Sometimes I think I'm misread because I'm laid-back. I'm misread as being bloodless.""

Buttigieg’s debate performance saw him get a big boost in the polls, with a recent USA Today/Suffolk poll of Iowa caucus-goers showing him surpassing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for third place behind Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden.

Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said Monday that some of his GOP colleagues in the Senate privately tell him how ""horrified"" they are by President Trump's behavior.

Appearing on CNN, Bennet was asked if he heard more ""private"" support for Trump from Republican lawmakers than what was known publicly. Bennet insisted it was quite the opposite.

""They’re horrified that he invited Ukraine to interfere in our elections, they are horrified that the chief of staff admitted it was a quid pro quo. They're particularly horrified by what president did in northern Syria by abandoning the Kurds there, something I think there's a consensus in the Senate -- no other president in history would have done,"" Bennet elaborated. ""We have to stand up to tyrants here and abroad... That's why we have to make America America again.""

BETO O'ROURKE INSISTS TRUMP IS A 'RUSSIAN ASSET' AMID CLINTON-GABBARD FEUD

He added, ""We’ve had enough of this guy and I do think their president -- Republicans in the Senate, who are getting awfully tired of having to defend him.""

Trump frequently has denied doing anything improper in his July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart. Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday denied his comments last week about withholding aid money to Ukraine constituted a quid pro quo. On Turkey's Syria incursion, the president said over the weekend: ""We are not a policing agent... It is time for us to go home.""

Bennet has long been struggling to gain traction on the campaign trail, polling at just one percent in the latest Fox News Poll. The Colorado lawmaker failed to meet the requirements to participate in the Democrats' last two debates and likely will not qualify for the next debate in November.

During the interview, he also went after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who he said was ""not being honest"" about how she would fund ""Medicare-for-all."" Warren has pledged to reveal how the U.S. would pay for it soon, amid concerns from critics that it could involve a tax hike for the middle class.

""I think that her plan, which costs $33 trillion, is the equivalent of 70 percent of all the taxes that the federal government will collect over the next ten years,"" Bennet continued. ""It hasn't been explained to the American people. It's a sound bite, and more than that, it's not based on common sense."""

""When you hear firsthand from people from Venezuela or Cuba who have dealt with socialism, who've been driven from their countries, who've dealt with the poverty and the instability it brings to their government, I think it really resonates. So we've launched VictimsOfSocialism.org so we can hear their stories firsthand and it is very powerful,"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on ""Fox & Friends.""

The ""Victims of Socialism"" campaign features a montage, as well as individual videos, of several people warning about socialism after their home nation spun into civil and economic disarray. It's the result of a monthslong effort by the RNC to highlight the dangers that could result from Democratic victories in 2020.

""The American people need to protect the United States from the socialist politics,"" a man identified as Amed G. says in the video.

SANDERS EMBRACES DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, CALLS FOR NEW DEAL REVIVAL IN CAMPAIGN ADDRESS

""It's crazy. It's incredible. With the socialists, [they] take your liberties and offer little candies. It's all free,"" he said before the video jumped to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., calling for ""free tuition.""

""Victims of Socialism"" represents a broader, apparent strategy by the RNC to tag Democrats with the more left-wing positions that gained steam during the Democratic primary. While the ad mostly targets Democratic candidates like Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., it also points to how a slew of 2020 candidates – including former Vice President Joe Biden, a perceived moderate – have committed to free health care for illegal immigrants.

The ad came as Biden looked less like the presumptive nominee and Warren gained ground in polling for key states. Warren maintains that she's capitalist, although she espouses many of the same policies as Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — both self-described ""Democratic socialists."" Sanders, who often polls in the top three among Democrats, also enjoyed a raucous rally last week in which progressive icon, Ocasio-Cortez, threw her weight behind him.

The new campaign aims to reinforce the longstanding criticism that socialism is a dream with plans that are divorced from reality.

""The socialist person, the socialist people. They are very good poets and they are very good in oratory,"" Warner M., a former Venezuelan mayor, explained.

After shifting to a clip of Ocasio-Cortez giving an impassioned speech, a woman appeared to describe how she and others made a terrible mistake in ignoring warnings about socialism.

""Of course, we made a terrible mistake. You know? We didn't listen. Many people warned us and said ... 'you need to stop this' and 'you do not need to go for this.' And unfortunately, we made the error of saying, 'that's not going to happen in Venezuela,"" said Karla N., who also left Venezuela.

Warner M. added that socialism begets leaders who are focused on ""how to maintain power.""

Echoing one of the men in the video, McDaniel said Tuesday that the Democratic candidates are ""promising free things like candy"" in order to regain power and urged voters to listen to warnings from others who have lived through socialist governments."

Kurdish military leader says his fighters still want to work with US, accuses Turkey of 'violating' cease-fire, 'ethnic cleansing'

The Kurdish military leader who serves as commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces revealed to Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin in a telephone interview Sunday from his base inside Syria that Turkey’s military has “violated” the planned cease-fire and was continuing to commit “ethnic cleansing.” Speaking through a translator, Gen. Mazloum Abdi said he was “deeply disappointed” in President Trump over the withdrawal of U.S. troops in northern Syria, and claimed there’s still time for the U.S. to help the Kurds fighting for their lives.

Trump considering leaving small number of US troops in Syria: report

President Trump is mulling a plan to keep hundreds of U.S. troops in northeast Syria after most of American forces leave, reports say. The goal of this plan would be to prevent Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s troops or Russian forces from taking control of Syria’s oil fields, which are mainly in Kurdish-held territory in the northeast part of the country. It would also enable the military to retain a foothold in the fight against ISIS militants.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has opposed Trump's initial decision to withdraw all 1,000 U.S. troops in northeast Syria, presented the idea to the president last week, the Wall Street Journal reported. Graham said in an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he remains ""optimistic"" that ""historic solutions"" can still be reached on Syria.

Gabbard reveals theory on why Hillary Clinton, DNC are pummeling her with 'smears'

Speaking directly to the camera in a video message posted on social media on Sunday, 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard suggested that Hillary Clinton recently ""smeared"" her as a ""Russian asset"" as payback for Gabbard's defiance of the party establishment in 2016.

""If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone -- and in fact, that's exactly the message they want to get across to you,"" Gabbard, a Democrat, said in the video. ""If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.

Romney takes shots at Trump over Syria, race

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, took a series of shots at President Trump in an interview that aired Sunday, claiming that under his leadership, the U.S. was abandoning allied Kurdish fighters in Syria and that some of the president's rhetoric appealed to racism. Romney and Trump have feuded off-and-on over the years, with the president regularly saying that former governor of Massachusetts ""choked"" in his bid to unseat President Obama in 2012.

Warren says she'll reveal plan to pay for 'Medicare-for-all' soon, amid middle-class tax hike fears

Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" plan. The new 2020 Democratic frontrunner said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ""What I see … is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of 'Medicare-for-all,' and specifically how we pay for it.""

Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ""Medicare-for-all"" plans at $32-34 trillion. Warren came under attack from her 2020 White House rivals at last week's primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to pay for her proposal.

Last year, we saw actor Geoffrey Owens of ""The Cosby Show"" mocked for working at Trader Joe's. This time, the spotlight is on former NHL player Donald Brashear.

On Wednesday, Le Journal de Quebec detailed Brashear's new job serving customers at a local Tim Hortons. Brashear fell on hard times following his NHL career, both personal and financial, and it appears he is using this job to help get back on his feet and re-establish himself. This decision should be applauded, supported and championed, not fodder for gossip.

PAUL BATURA: COP WITH 35 YEARS ON THE STREETS OFFERS FIVE POWERFUL LESSONS FOR LIFE

Brashear’s story is just one example of a concerning trend of blue-collar jobs being depicted as a low point in someone’s life, rather than an opportunity.

Former Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin didn’t have a college degree — he dropped out after three years to take a job with the American Red Cross — and fielded criticism for years that his lack of a diploma meant he wasn’t qualified to lead.

In February, Elizabeth Warren said her father ""ended up"" a janitor while she had more opportunities, insinuating that being a janitor was somehow below value, raising questions from voters across the country.

And in last week’s Democratic debate, Sen. Cory Booker paid lip service to the dignity of work, but his record doesn’t reflect someone who truly values it.

Booker, like Warren and many of their Democratic colleagues, supports liberal policies across the country that are designed to keep able-bodied adults out of work, including waivers and efforts against work requirements for able-bodied adults. With record-low unemployment and millions of job openings, there hasn’t been a better time in recent history to be a worker here in America. But instead of encouraging people to enter the workforce and empower them through work, we’re seeing them promote the alternative — dependency.

There is dignity in all work, and many pathways to success — but everyone has to start somewhere.

Our country’s story is a rich tapestry of men and women working their way up the economic ladder and boosting the next generation even higher than themselves. Many of our current and former leaders worked on farms, flipped burgers at McDonald’s (like former Speaker Paul Ryan), or were once on welfare (like Rep. Ted Yoho). I had my first taste of work babysitting in my early teens and then taught gymnastics and cheerleading through high school and college.

Our backgrounds are like millions of others across the country, and in each of these cases, working-class jobs weren’t what defined us as people. They were one part of our stories. After all, there is dignity in all work, and many pathways to success — but everyone has to start somewhere.

The more I think about it, the more I believe the piece on Brashear’s work at Tim Hortons was mislabeled. It isn’t a poor-me story of a man who fell from grace. It’s a comeback story, and an inspiration to people who feel like giving up when the life they thought they’d have didn’t go according to plan.

If our goal is to see people get through difficult life situations and past bad decisions and come out on the side of success, we cannot then shame them for their efforts to do so.

No one is *just* a janitor or *just* a factory worker—these are paths towards a better life and a way for people to take care of themselves and their families.

This country was built on a foundation of hard work. It's inherent to the fabric of who we are, and something we need to encourage for generations to come.

BUTTI-BOOM REDUX

USA Today: “It's a new three-way race in Iowa. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was initially seen as a long-shot presidential contender, has surged within striking distance of former vice president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll finds. … The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Biden at 18%, Warren at 17% and Buttigieg at 13% among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers. Those standings reflect significant changes since the Suffolk/USA TODAY poll taken in Iowa at the end of June, when Biden led Warren by double digits and Buttigieg trailed at a distant 6%. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who was then in second place after a strong showing in the first Democratic debate, has plummeted 13 percentage points and is now in a three-way tie for sixth. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned 9% support, the same number as in the June poll.”



Buttigieg, Klobuchar try to capitalize - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar shot out of the last Democratic debate with the most precious commodity a presidential candidate can get before the Iowa caucuses: momentum. … The new round of attention for both Midwesterners comes at a key moment: Klobuchar has yet to qualify for the November debate stage, while Buttigieg faced new questions about his campaign’s attention to racial issues. And both of them still have significant ground to make up in the polls. … Based on money and staff footprint, Buttigieg is better positioned: He ended September with $23.4 million in his campaign account — third in the Democratic field — while Klobuchar has $3.7 million to spend. She’s only reached 3 percent in one early-state poll, and she needs three more to qualify for the November debate. On the ground in Iowa, Buttigieg’s staff is about double the size of Klobuchar’s. Both candidates are currently airing TV ads in Iowa.”



Are Dems ready for a Midwest moment? - LAT: “Both long shots are now trying — with swings through early-voting states, new ads and endorsements, and intensified fundraising efforts — to keep their post-debate sizzle hot and find an opening in the contest that has been shaping up as a showdown between Biden and Warren. In the process, they are surfacing a long-simmering debate about the dominance of the party’s liberal wing on the East and West coasts — making a more pointed case than Biden, whose campaign pitch builds on his experience more than ideology. ‘It’s the Midwest versus the rest of the country,’ said Rufus Gifford, who was finance director of President Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012 and is uncommitted in the 2020 race. ‘Both Pete and Amy really focused on the fact that this is the part of the country we need to win, and we are losing.’”



Klobuchar says she’s peaking at the right time - WaPo: “Klobuchar, who struggled for attention in the Democratic primary, says this week's debate helped her catch on at exactly the right time. Her town halls are crowded, with staffers running to get more chairs to pack breweries or event centers. She leads the field in local endorsements, especially state legislators, ‘with more to come,’ she says. She kicked off her bus tour with the support of Andy McKean, a Republican state legislator who bolted his party six months ago and who pronounced Klobuchar the kind of Democrat who could unite America again. ‘If you want to peak in this race,’ she said after a stop in Waterloo, ‘you want to peak now, instead of six months before [the caucuses].’ A few other candidates still draw larger crowds, but Klobuchar is going for a particular kind of caucus-goer: the loyal Democrat who wants to win back those mysterious Trump voters.”



Zuckerberg gave hiring recommendations to Buttigieg campaign - Bloomberg: “Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has privately recommended several potential hires to Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, a rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech’s most powerful executives. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg’s campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring, campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed. Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg’s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.”



WARREN SCRAMBLES ON HEALTH INSURANCE

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ‘Medicare-for-all’ plan. The Massachusetts Democrat and White House candidate said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ‘What I see … is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of ‘Medicare-for-all,’ and specifically how we pay for it.’ Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ‘Medicare-for-all’ plans at $32-34 trillion. She added about the universal health insurance plan: ‘This is something I’ve been working on for months and months, and it’s got just a little more work until it’s finished.’”



Gabbard uses Hillary in bid for relevancy - Fox News: “Speaking directly to the camera in a video message posted on social media on Sunday, 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard suggested that Hillary Clinton recently ‘smeared’ her as a ‘Russian asset’ as payback for Gabbard's defiance of the party establishment in 2016. … [In the video Gabbard said,] ‘If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.

They will not silence us.’ … Several candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson, have criticized Clinton's unfounded suggestion that Russians have been ‘grooming’ Gabbard to be a third-party spoiler in the race.”

TIME OUT: FROM WAY BACK WHEN

AP: “A crew of deep-sea explorers and historians looking for lost World War II warships have found a second Japanese aircraft carrier that went down in the historic Battle of Midway. Vulcan Inc.’s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high frequency sonar images of the warship Sunday and say that its dimensions and location mean it has to be the carrier Akagi. The Akagi was found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument resting in nearly 18,000 feet (5,490 meters) of water more than 1,300 miles (2,090 kilometers) northwest of Pearl Harbor. The researchers used an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, equipped with sonar to find the ship. The vehicle had been out overnight collecting data, and the image of a warship appeared in the first set of readings Sunday morning.”

MULVANEY AGONISTES

Politico: “Mick Mulvaney’s week went from bad to worse on Sunday, as he again tried to explain why President Donald Trump and the administration had withheld aid to Ukraine for weeks — one of Democrats’ central questions in their impeachment inquiry. Mulvaney fumbled during an interview on ‘Fox News Sunday’ when he cited two reasons for the delay, whereas he had listed three during his Thursday news briefing at the White House. He continued to blame reporters for any misunderstanding, a feat that can be tough to pull off when his answers were all delivered on camera and when the host, Chris Wallace, let the tape keep rolling. And he threw red meat to liberals and Democratic presidential candidates who have long questioned the appropriateness of the Trump family continuing to profit from their business holdings while Trump serves as president. … Mulvaney’s interview did not play well among Trump allies and advisers, with one calling it a ‘self-immolation.’”



Party support for Trump gets tested - WSJ: “President Trump faces increasing public and private scrutiny from his own party over a series of recent White House moves, as the House impeachment inquiry reduces his margin for error with fellow Republicans and makes him more vulnerable to attacks. In the past several days, Mr. Trump has been forced to drop plans to host next year’s Group of Seven summit at his Doral golf resort, and a top aide has tried to walk back comments linking Ukraine military aid to an investigation of the president’s political opponents. The fallout of Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has continued to draw widespread criticism, including from Republicans. Mr. Trump’s support within his party will face fresh tests this week, as key witnesses from the State Department and Pentagon are expected to testify in closed hearings before a trio of House committees on the president’s dealings with Ukraine.”



Continetti: Trump fatigue syndrome - National Review: “I was surprised to read Robert J. Samuelson’s column in the Washington Post arguing for the impeachment and removal of President Trump. Samuelson is, above all, a realist who has looked on economics and politics with a tough and somewhat cynical eye for some 30 years. … Samuelson has reached his breaking point. And he isn’t alone. A large part of the country suffers from Trump Fatigue Syndrome. This is related but not identical to Trump Derangement Syndrome. The sufferers of Trump Fatigue aren’t driven mad by the president. They are just tired of having to wake up every morning to another of his sudden attacks, reversals, exaggerations, and boasts. They want the show to end.”



Dems ready more witnesses for impeachment probe - Reuters: “Democrats on Monday laid out their case for the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump and pressed Republicans to stop supporting Trump by releasing a fact sheet and video they said expose Trump’s efforts to secure victory in the 2020 presidential election with the assistance of Ukraine. The releases ‘encapsulate all the evidence uncovered to date about the president’s months-long pressure campaign to undermine the 2020 election and the extent to which he abused his power by using the levers of government to advance the scheme,’ according to the office of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives. They also showed how Democrats may approach the charges, or articles of impeachment, they are expected to draw up at the conclusion of the probe. The articles of impeachment, if approved by the House, would then be sent to Senate for a trial on whether to remove Trump from office.”



TRUMP OVERWHELMS DEMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

NYT: “That campaigns are now being fought largely online is hardly a revelation, yet only one political party seems to have gotten the message. While the Trump campaign has put its digital operation firmly at the center of the president’s re-election effort, Democrats are struggling to internalize the lessons of the 2016 race and adapt to a political landscape shaped by social media. Mr. Trump’s first campaign took far better advantage of Facebook and other platforms that reward narrowly targeted — and, arguably, nastier — messages. And while the president is now embattled on multiple fronts and disfavored by a majority of Americans in most polls, he has one big advantage: His 2020 campaign, flush with cash, is poised to dominate online again, according to experts on both ends of the political spectrum, independent researchers and tech executives. The difference between the parties’ digital efforts, they said, runs far deeper than the distinction between an incumbent’s general-election operation and challengers’ primary campaigns.”



Dems also worry about Trump’s money machine - Politico: “Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee have raised more than $300 million this year for his reelection — more than any other sitting president in history at this point in the campaign. Trump has nearly twice as much cash on hand — $158 million, between his campaign account and the RNC — as Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this time in his successful re-election run. … Democrats, meanwhile, are still four or five months away — at the earliest — from settling on a nominee. ‘We don’t know if the Democratic candidate is going to be able to even compete with such a shorter timeline, even if they have significant resources after the convention,’ said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive officer of the progressive group ACRONYM. With the Democratic primary in full swing, McGowan said, ‘There’s two separate elections going on, and the really unfortunate part is Trump is the only one involved in the general election today.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I've a sad sense of déjà vu: 2020 is shaping up to be another election which leaves no major candidate for whom I can vote. As a conservative, I had serious concerns about Trump's temperament but was long done with the Clintons’ modus operandi. Now I face a similar situation: Vote for someone who, against all military advice and in one stroke, abruptly abandoned allies in the field to danger and death and diminished (if not killed outright) our chances of creating such alliances in the future, or vote for a socialist. As for David Brooks ‘policies can be argued about and reversed,’ in what world? I can think of quite a few bad policies that have never been reversed, amended or fixed because once created, they spawn dependent bureaucracies and constituencies. Attempt to touch them and you'll meet Paul Ryan's fate. Worse, voting for a Democrat lends legitimacy to the vicious, hateful behavior displayed toward Brett Kavanaugh and the underhanded, partisan impeachment inquiry. (Impeachment is a political process, but as you've pointed out, it wasn't intended to be a partisan one.) Many Republican Senators might prefer to remove him, have Pence and peace and be done with it. (Sounds good to me.) But how many will be able to bring themselves to vote for removal, thereby legitimizing a process that locked out their House counterparts? It's growing very grey days in voter land.” – Triche Osborne, Baton Rouge, La.



[Ed. note: I hear you! Another few weeks like the ones we’ve had and I may seek out an island in the Aleutians to live out my days with the polar bears. But… We are very privileged to be alive in this moment. Life, especially as free people, is always a privilege, but how lucky are we to be alive at a moment when America, the West, and really, our whole species is fundamentally re-evaluating what it’s all about. I choose not to despair because history tells me that we will figure it out. Maybe not in a straight line, but we will get there. I base this not on the fact that there is an arc to history (there isn’t) but rather because we have all of the necessary ingredients to make what comes next freer, fairer and more dedicated the American creed.]



“As you note, there are many indicators supporting your observation that we are in the midst of enormous societal and hence political change. But I would dispute your conclusion that no politician is addressing this change. Andrew Yang had built his campaign explicitly around this change which he believes will accelerate over the next two decades. I am disappointed that you and the rest of the political press have paid so little attention. You may well not agree with his prescriptions, but he has clearly diagnosed the disease and deserves serious consideration. In the last debate, I was struck by his quiet observation about Sweden's wealth tax proposal - it has been tried by several other developed nations and failed - adding - why can't we learn from the experience of others?” – Matt Lincoln, Portola Valley, Calif.



[Ed. note: Yang may be prescient, Mr. Lincoln, but he also is a pessimist. One of the reasons he has connected so well with younger males is that he matches the sense of foreboding common among many millennial dudes. I do grant you that he is one of the few candidates who is even talking about this Gutenberg-level (Johannes not Steve) disruption that’s working its way through our society. I wish politicians in both parties would think about the same stuff.]



“Well I live in the UK and I am 72 years old, but I watch and read Fox News every day without fail… Before Trump decided to run for President I loved this man to death, he is just what I wanted to see in a President of the USA. Today at times I cringe when Trump opens his mouth or goes off on one on Twitter, he is the making of all his problems to date… Now I want Trump to get a 2nd term but he must CONTROL his mouth and have more respect for people who he talks to after all this is the most powerful man on planet Earth…” – Michael O'Connor, West Yorkshire, England

YA BASIC

AP: “A BASE jumper who jumped illegally from a northwestern Wisconsin cellphone tower ended up calling the police on himself after his parachute became caught on a guy wire, leaving him dangling perilously 50 feet (15 meters) from the ground. Police say the 20-year-old man jumped from the 300-foot (90-meter) Charter Communications tower in Menomonie on Thursday morning. After his rescue at around 9:30 a.m., the man was treated at Mayo Clinic Health System and arrested for criminal trespass. BASE jumping stands for building, antenna, span and earth — the four common objects from which BASE jumpers launch their descent.”

The Benzie County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that 47-year-old Adrienne Quintal, of Warren, was staying at a family cabin in a remote area of Honor, Mich., located about 25 west of Traverse City. Quintal made a call at 2:45 a.m. on Thursday to a ""third party"" in Warren and ""asked for help,"" according to the sheriff's office, who said the third party then contacted their office.

""Deputies and Michigan State Police arrived on scene at 2:58 a.m. and observed evidence of possible foul play but were unable to locate Adrienne,"" police wrote on Facebook.

WEST POINT CADET GOES MISSING IN NEW YORK ALONG WITH HIS RIFLE, SPARKING MASSIVE SEARCH

Quintal's son, Nick White, told FOX2 on Monday that his mother went up north with her boyfriend to the family cabin, but the boyfriend returned to their home in Southfield, Mich. on Tuesday, Oct. 15, two days before Quintal was reported missing.

""He was up there with her, he came home to drop supplies off, we are working on the condo here,"" White said.

Quintal was at the cabin to do some work on it, according to White.

""She was also just getting ready for hunting and hanging out and enjoying the wildlife,"" he told FOX2.

The sheriff's office said the 47-year-old's purse, phone and car remained on the property.

PHOENIX OFFICIALS FLEW TO MEXICO TO HELP FIND MISSING MAN WHO FELL IN SINKHOLE, WAS SWEPT AWAY IN STORM DRAIN

Investigators attempted to track Quintal's movements with a K-9 team but were unable to find her. White told FOX2 that police were out with a dog searching all of Thursday morning before a search party made another attempt later to find his mother.

Over the weekend, local and state police joined the Benzie-Manistee Community Emergency Response Team with a group of about 20 people, but the searchers again came up empty.

CERT public information officer Glenn Zaring told WWTV the group was out until 4:30 p.m. on Saturday doing sweeps of areas after using a computer program to help them track the probabilities of where someone may be located.

“We were actually searching almost like the back swampy area from Little Platte Lake up into some very thick hunting woods along Indian Hill Road,” Zaring told the television station.

Officials are expected to be out Tuesday morning with a drone in another attempt to find Quintal, according to WWTV.

Quintal, who goes by the name Ada, has long brown hair with brown eyes, according to police. She is approximately 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 125 pounds.

DEM ELITES SEARCHING FOR WHITE KNIGHT

NYT: “When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race — but could be lured in. Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. It’s that time of the election season for Democrats. ‘Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I’ve had five or six people ask me: ‘Is there anybody else?’ said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party’s recent conventions.”

Warren ups the ante another $800 billion - WSJ: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $800 billion in additional federal funding for public education, a move that would exhaust the remaining revenue to be raised by her proposed wealth tax even as she seeks ways to finance Medicare for All. Ms. Warren outlined on the blog site Medium an additional $450 billion in Title I funding to boost schools with low-income students, $200 billion in grants for students with disabilities and $100 billion in other grants over 10 years. She also vowed to invest $50 billion in school infrastructure on top of existing funding for school upgrades that are in some of her other policy proposals.”



Castro promises to quit if he can’t raise $800,000 in 10 days - Politico: “Julián Castro on Monday threatened to suspend his presidential bid unless he can raise nearly $1 million by the end of the month. ‘If I can’t raise $800,000 in the next 10 days — I will have no choice but to end my race for president,’ Castro wrote in a fundraising email to supporters. ‘If I don’t meet this deadline, I won’t have the resources to keep my campaign running.’ The strategy is nearly identical to Cory Booker’s ‘radical transparency’ gambit last month, when his campaign warned in a memo to supporters that the New Jersey senator would end his White House bid if he was unable to raise $1.7 million in the final 10 days of September.”



Buttigieg’s sexuality a hurdle with black voters - The [Columbia, S.C.] State: “Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a key reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: many see his sexuality as a problem. The 21-page report, conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group with black Democratic South Carolina voters in mid-July and obtained exclusively by McClatchy, found that ‘being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed deeply uncomfortable even discussing it. … [T]heir preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center. While the report stated that Buttigieg’s sexuality was not a ‘disqualifier’ for these voters, some of the focus group participants questioned why Buttigieg even brought it up.’



Facebook ramps up election security efforts ahead of 2020 - AP: “With just over a year left until the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Facebook is stepping up its efforts to ensure it is not used as a tool to interfere in politics and democracies around the world. The efforts include a special security tool for elected officials and candidates that monitors them for hacking attempts. Facebook said Monday it will also label state-controlled media as such, label fact-checks more clearly and invest $2 million in media literacy projects. The company says it will add more prominent labels on debunked posts on Facebook as well as on Instagram. It will put labels on top of what are deemed ‘false’ and ‘partly false’ photos and videos.”

TIME OUT: ‘EVERYONE’S GOT THEIR THING’

NYT: “The pressures of sexual selection have made peacocks gorgeous, wood thrushes sonorous and birds of paradise great dancers. At first glance, the white bellbird doesn’t appear to have benefited similarly. Barrel-chested and big-mouthed, with a long wattle dangling from the top of its beak, this rainforest bird looks more like a Muppet than an avian Casanova. But everyone’s got their thing. According to a paper published Monday in Current Biology, this goofball boasts the loudest birdsong ever recorded. And he must be proud of it, because he sings the most piercing note right into potential mates’ faces. The white bellbird — one of four bellbird species in South and Central America — is a favorite among birders in Brazil. It has a ‘strange, metallic, kind of alien call,’ said Caio Brito, one of the founders of Brazil Birding Experts. When several sing at once, they are ‘deafening,’ and sound like ‘several blacksmiths trying to compete,’ said Arthur Gomes, a biology student at São Paulo State University who contributed to the new research.”

IMPEACHMENT TIMING GETS TRICKIER FOR HOUSE DEMS

NYT: “House Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings against President Trump will extend into the Christmas season, as they plan a series of public hearings intended to make the simplest and most devastating possible public case in favor of removing Mr. Trump. Democratic leaders had hoped to move as soon as Thanksgiving to wrap up a narrow inquiry focused around Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, buoyed by polling data that shows that the public supports the investigation, even if voters are not yet sold on impeaching the president. But after a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale — and probably more time-consuming — effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill.”



Diplomat who raised red flag on Giuliani-Trump deal testifies today - Reuters: “William Taylor, a former Army officer and career U.S. diplomat now leading the U.S. embassy in Kiev, will be the latest in a series of current and former officials to meet behind closed doors with the Democratic-led House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees in the month since the probe began. Committee members and staff are examining whether the Republican Trump abused his office by improperly putting pressure on Ukraine to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival and leading candidate for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination. Taylor’s testimony is of particular interest to investigators because of his leading role at the embassy in Ukraine. He raised concern about military assistance being withheld from Kiev to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.”



Schiff un-censured - Fox News: “The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted Monday evening to table, or set aside, a resolution to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The vote was 218 to 185 to table the resolution, which the Republican minority had introduced. All Democrats voted to table the censure resolution, with all Republicans voting against tabling. Independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party earlier this year, voted to table the resolution.”



President Trump draws ire of black lawmakers for ‘lynching’ claim - AP: “President Donald Trump enraged Democrats on Tuesday by comparing their impeachment inquiry to a lynching, assigning the horrors of a deadly and racist chapter in U.S. history to a process laid out in the Constitution. ‘That is one word no president ought to apply to himself,’ said Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African American in Congress. ‘That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using’ he said. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., called on Trump to delete the tweet.”



MICK MULVANEY: KICKING GAFFES AND TAKING NAMES

Reuters: “U.S. President Donald Trump has been fielding suggestions from allies on who might succeed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, amid frustration at his team’s response to the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, two sources close to the White House said on Monday. Trump’s irritation at being dogged by a variety of issues - from impeachment to his decision to move U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria - was on display on Monday in the White House Cabinet Room as the president aired his grievances at length before his senior advisers and a group of reporters. The president has been focused in part on Mulvaney’s comments to reporters last week that Trump had withheld military aid from Ukraine in an effort to get Kiev to investigate a debunked claim about the 2016 U.S. election.”



Cuccinelli blocked from DHS job - AP: “President Donald Trump has been notified by his staff that he can’t select two popular figures — Ken Cuccinelli and Mark Morgan — to serve as an acting secretary of homeland security because a federal law governing agency succession makes them ineligible. Instead, Sean Doocey, the White House director of presidential personnel, in recent days gave Trump a list of other officials to consider as acting secretary, including top DHS official Chad Wolf and Transportation Security Administration chief David Pekoske, according to three people familiar with the conversation. The news has infuriated immigration hawks inside and outside the administration who had been lobbying for Cuccinelli to fill the role and now fear Trump will tap Wolf, a former chief of staff to ousted DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen who once worked as a lobbyist on employment visas.”



TRUMP LOOKS SOUTH FOR A BOOST

Politico: “Donald Trump is going all-in on a trio of Southern governor’s races in November, gambling that a clean sweep will help him regain his political footing at the most perilous moment of his presidency. Trump is expected to barnstorm Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana over the next few weeks, while dispatching prominent supporters to help in each contest. And Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through eastern Kentucky, a pivotal area on the state’s political map that could decide the fate of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. Trump badly needs a boost right now, and the White House sees the elections in the conservative states as the best near-term hope of achieving it.”



Impeachment adds windage to Kentucky contest - WSJ: “The gubernatorial election in Kentucky next month hinges in large part on whether voters are motivated by bread-and-butter issues close to home or national politics supercharged by the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. It is one of three governor’s races this year, along with those in Louisiana and Mississippi, that can offer insights on the electorate’s mood ahead of the 2020 presidential election.”

“I have come to fully realize something you told me when we met … a couple months ago. ‘Opinions are Luxuries: Have Only as Many as You Can Afford.’ Believe I’ve exceeded my budget and will have to cut back.” – Fred W. Apelquist III, Oak Hill, Va.



[Ed. note: You will be so glad you did! “Opinions are luxury items” is a close cousin to one of my dad’s favorites: “You can be happy or you can be right, but not usually both.” In our relationships it matters so much more that we listen and really hear each other. The simple but always challenging act of loving our neighbors starts by talking with them, which can’t happen if we’re talking at them. This not only makes us happier people and better friends, spouses and parents it also lets us save our strongest defenses for the things that matter the most.]

PICTURE DAY IS THE WURST

WSVN: “A 4th grader had a unique outfit for his school photo. Craig Arsenault posted a photo of his son Jake’s school ID. For his school photo, Jake dressed up in a hot dog costume. ‘My wife and I dared our son to wear a hot dog costume for school pictures. The school let him do it, and I couldn’t be happier,’ Arsenault said. According to Fox 13, Arsenault said the family had the costume “laying around for (the) last year,” and the idea came up when Jake voiced his wonder about what to wear for his school photo. ‘My wife suggested the hot dog costume. He was hesitant, so we bet him 10 bucks he wouldn’t do it,’ the father said. However, Jake accepted the dare and donned the costume for his photo. … Arsenault said he only had $7 at the time, which he gave to his son, but his son is holding him to the other $3.”

The pl… [+4268 chars]",The GOP plan comes after Republicans were unable to agree on an option to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act while they held both the House and the Senate during the first two years of President Trump's administration.,2019-10-22,Fox News,House Republicans release plan in bid to fulfill Trump promise as 'party of health care',https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-release-healthcare-plan-in-effort-to-fulfill-trump-promise-as-the-party-of-healthcare,"The Republican Study Committee released a healthcare plan Tuesday to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, two years after the GOP was unable to agree on a health care plan during the first year of President Trump's administration.

The plan also represents an effort to compete with Democrats' messaging on ""Medicare-for-All"" and other health care plans as the 2020 Democratic primary campaign hits its stride.

The 66-page framework seeks to ""transform the individual marketplace's current regulatory structure, unwind the ACA's Washington-centric approach and largely return regulatory authority to individual states.""

This includes provisions to increase the portability of health insurance within the individual marketplace, provide federal funding for state-designed ""guaranteed coverage pools"" which would help cover individuals with pre-existing conditions -- though it does not require states to run such pools -- put a moratorium on Medicaid expansions so it can be ""sustainable ... for generations to come"" and promotes ""innovative care"" such as telemedicine.

""It is a plan that: PROTECTS the vulnerable,"" a statement attached to the plan says, ""especially those with pre-existing conditions; EMPOWERS individuals with greater control over their health care choices and dollars; and PERSONALIZES health care to meet individual needs and reduce premiums, deductibles, and the overall cost of health care.""

2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SAYS ELIZABETH WARREN IS LYING ABOUT HER HEALTHCARE PLAN: 'IT'S A SOUNDBITE'

Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., Rep. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. Rep. Larry Buchshon, R-Ind., Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., Rep John Joyce, R-Pa., Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C. and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas all signed the document.

The health care portability provision, specifically, would extend similar protections to those moving from individual plan to individual plan as currently exist for those between employer-sponsored insurance plans. This, the framework's authors say, would prevent patients from being denied coverage while moving between individual plans, for example, while moving to a different state.

The RSC's document, which is not a bill but rather a list of ideas the RSC says will be hashed out through debate, also includes increased limits on health savings accounts. The RSC proposes uncoupling health savings accounts from high-deductible plans and raising the cap on such accounts to $9,000 for individuals and $18,000 for families, more than double what is allowed under current law.

The RSC framework does add one caveat to the use of health savings accounts, however.

SANDERS ACCUSES BIDEN OF PUSHING INSURANCE INDUSTRY 'TALKING POINTS' BY SLAMMING 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

""Critically, while the RSC plan would unleash health savings accounts, it would ensure that these accounts are pro-life and do not inadvertently allow a back-door method of subsidizing abortion procedures,"" the plan reads. ""Accordingly, the RSC plan would ensure these accounts cannot be linked to a plan that provides abortions, nor would abortions or abortion drugs be an eligible expense.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the RSC's ideas, criticizing Republicans for not bringing Democrats into the fold on their plans to replace the Affordable Care Act.

""After 10 years of refusing to work with Democrats to #ProtectOurCare, the only plans offered by Republicans don’t cover & protect preexisting conditions,"" she tweeted Tuesday. ""They say their plan is an alternative to the Affordable Care Act but it’s really just an alternative to health care, period.""

The conservative organization Freedomworks, on the other hand, released a statement in support of the RSC's proposal, saying it would improve health care for consumers while also sticking to small-government principles.

“We’re thrilled to see a coalition in Congress with a health care plan that is based around individual choice and ownership of health insurance,"" Jason Pye, FreedomWorks Vice President of Legislative Affairs, said. ""The RSC plan also respects federalism by allowing states to decide how best to extend affordable coverage for their residents.

“From the large expansion of health savings accounts to the elimination of many provisions of current law that have made health insurance coverage so unaffordable, Americans across the country will benefit from the choice afforded to them by this plan."""

Clearly the polls say Americans want to feel like they are part of the team. Inclusive. A musical montage from a teen movie where everyone chips in and they save the day. But don’t be fooled: These candidates are not like you, and the policies they support are actually bad for regular Americans. In fact, their slogans should all be the same: ""Do as I say, not as I do.""

Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to being green.

TUCKER CARLSON: POLS WHO USE KIDS TO GAIN POWER MAY BE A GREATER 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' THAN CLIMATE CHANGE?

As part of their required Federal Election Commission quarterly filings, the candidates disclosed how their finances and each campaign have been spending a lot of money on private jet travel. After all, how else does one get from Iowa to New Hampshire? In coach? Taking off shoes at TSA? With campaign donations picking up the tab, private jets make the campaign trail much better.

For a collective group of Democrats who decry fossil fuels, who embrace the radical Green New Deal, who demand we change our habits and diets to reflect the “existential crisis” of climate change, they sure don’t put their campaign money with their mouth is.

Every one of the 2020 candidates supports the Green New Deal (GND) as part of their campaign, and as a reminder, this radical, socialist proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seeks to make air travel ""obsolete."" Air travel is such a no-no amongst environmentalists that ""flight shaming"" has become a common tactic the green radicals use.

So, why do these candidates get a pass? If they want us to stop flying commercial, why are they justified in flying private?

The Buttigieg campaign said it needs private jets because South Bend isn't convenient to campaign stops and the mayor has a vigorous schedule. Here’s a question for Mayor Pete: If I live in rural America and am busy, can I get an exemption under the Green New Deal you support?

We all know the answer to that question, plebeian.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., say their flights are actually ""carbon neutral"" because they buy carbon offsets, presumably with campaign contributions. That's like justifying a cheesecake for dinner by purchasing my neighbor a treadmill. For his dog. And the treadmill company donates to my campaign. Yet, in the silly and slimy world of D.C. politics and sympathetic press, somehow that excuse evens out.

All these candidates are too cowardly to admit what we all know: They travel on private jets because they can. Playing us for fools just adds insult to injury.

Their private air travel is possible for one reason, and one reason alone: America is great. Right now, there are millions of Americans in rural places like Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and Artesia, New Mexico, working in the energy industry. These are the men and women who power America doing hard, difficult, even dangerous work, and we all benefit from the fruit of their labor.

We have an incredible amount of oil and gas reserves across this nation, and many are still yet untapped. Our abundant energy means prices are low. A decade ago, oil consistently hovered around $100 a barrel. Today, it is half that. This means cheaper gas and home utility bills. Information technology is reflected in the manufacturing and shipping costs of consumer goods. Abundant energy means we spend less. This is something we should celebrate.

What happens when the Green New Deal does make air travel ""obsolete"" and the 10 million American jobs in the airline industry are lost? What happens when Sanders gets his wish to make fracking illegal by executive order and consequently half our oil and two-thirds our gas comes off the market?

I’ll tell you what happens: You won't fly home for Christmas. You won't buy fruit in winter. Cold weather and athletic clothing with lycra and Core-Tex and nylon won’t be affordable. Food prices will skyrocket. Shipping costs will make European goods unaffordable, and speaking of Europe, forget about going. You can't afford it, because with oil around $200 a barrel, even a cruise is out of the question.

What happens when politicians destroy the fossil fuel industry is, they destroy the economy and our way of life.

Next time you see a candidate in a stump speech decrying climate change, demanding a Green New Deal, even calling energy industry workers ""Criminals,"" just ask a simple question: Will you, candidate, stop using these fossil fuels, the cheap gas, the plastics, the oil, the private jets, in your campaign?

We all know the answer to that, plebeian.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Bill Hemmer, Zeldin, R-N.Y., said that Clinton is ""acting out"" and ""blaming anyone other than herself for that loss in 2016.""

In addition, he noted that Gabbard, D-Hawaii, supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in 2016.

""You have these people who, they've run for president...they lose, they're bitter, they're resentful,"" Zeldin told Hemmer. ""The president won this office ... and, instead of working with this president and advocating for USMCA or reducing prescription drug prices and so much more, instead, there's that bitterness.""

BIDEN AND WARREN CAMPAIGNS SILENT OVER CLINTON ATTACK ON GABBARD: TOMI LAHREN THINKS SHE KNOWS WHY

""You see it on the Democratic side with Hillary Clinton — and now she's going after Tulsi Gabbard calling her a 'Russian asset,'"" he said.

Appearing on former President Obama aide David Plouffe's ""Campaign HQ"" podcast last week, Clinton accused Gabbard – although not referring to her by name – of being a ""Russian asset"" and a ""third-party candidate.""

“I'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

Gabbard lashed out at Clinton on Twitter Friday, calling her the ""queen of warmongers [and the] embodiment of corruption"" in response to the allegations.

She also told Fox News' Tucker Carlson on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" last week that Clinton is waging a smear campaign against her because ""she knows she can't control me."" She accused Clinton of having ""blood on her hands"" after the Iraq War she ""championed.""

""Their blood is on her hands. That's why she's smearing my character and trying to undermine my campaign,"" Gabbard said.

In an exclusive interview Monday on “Hannity,” President Trump blasted his former opponent.

""I said, wait a minute, it took me two-and-a-half years, I wish she would have said that earlier because people... have realized she is crazy,"" he told Hannity. ""She’s crazy.”

Some Democrats have made similar claims about Gabbard, but other prominent leaders have slammed Clinton.

""Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,"" wrote Sanders. ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.""

""[Hillary is] not dealing with her loss well,"" said Zeldin. ""She believes that ... the legacy of why she lost is due to – in her mind – the Russians changing the outcome of our election. I think she's convinced herself of it.""

""She has this bitterness towards Russia because of it and she's gotten to the point where she also blames Tulsi Gabbard,"" he concluded.

Team officials completed the deal Monday, less than two hours before an NBA deadline would have allowed players with rookie contracts to become restricted free agents next summer.

The Pacers did not announce financial terms of the deal though ESPN.com first reported it was worth $77 million in guaranteed money and Sabonis could make as much as $85 million with bonuses.

A message was left by The Associated Press with Sabonis' agent, Greg Lawrence.

""I'm very excited to remain with the Pacers, this is where I wanted to be,"" Sabonis said in a statement. ""I appreciate the organization showing their confidence in me, and I'm ready to be part of what's going to be a great year for our team.""

It's dramatic turnabout from last weekend when reports surfaced Sabonis soon could be on the trading block.

But now the Pacers have four of this season's projected starters under contract through at least 2021-22.

Center Myles Turner, last season's NBA blocks champion, signed his four-year extension worth $72 million last October. Point guard Malcolm Brogdon was acquired in a sign-and-trade from Milwaukee this summer after agreeing to terms on a four-year deal worth $85 million. Small forward T.J. Warren also was acquired in at trade this summer, from Phoenix, and still has three years remaining on what was originally a four-year deal worth $47 million.

The contract of two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo, expires after next season.

Oladipo is still recovering from a torn quad tendon in his right knee, which forced him to miss the final three months last season. He's recently ramped up his activity during practices but is not expected to see any game action until at least December.

But in the midst of a major offseason overhaul, the Pacers became convinced that putting Sabonis at power forward and using a more traditional lineup with two big men on the floor could work.

So Monday, Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard made it clear this was not just an experiment. Instead, he made a hefty investment to give the lineup a chance to work.

""We love the toughness that Domantas brings to our team, and we can't wait to see him play in his expanded role this year,"" Pritchard said. ""He's had so much growth in his career and we're excited for what that means for his future, as well as the future of our team.""

Sabonis started 66 games as a rookie in Oklahoma City before he being traded to Indiana, with Oladipo, in a swap for Paul George.

With Indiana, Sabonis has made steady progress.

He averaged 11.6 points and 7.7 rebounds in his first season with the Pacers — a significant improvement over his rookie season in 2016-17. And last season he finished as the runner-up for the NBA's Sixth Man Award after averaging 14.1 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 0.6 blocks — all career highs."

More accurately, in a podcast hosted by former Obama apparatchik David Plouffe, Clinton said candidate Gabbard is “the favorite of the Russians” and suggested Moscow was supporting her bid through fake social media postings.

Since Gabbard is only polling at 1.2 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average, Russia doesn’t seem to be helping much. More important, there is zero evidence that any such meddling has occurred.

BRUCE ASHFORD: BETO'S ATTACK ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY NOT JUST WRONG BUT DISASTROUS — HERE ARE FOUR REASONS WHY

What on earth could have prompted such an outlandish charge? We can start with Clinton’s enduring belief that the Russians were behind her 2016 defeat, in addition to James Comey, misogyny, Bernie Sanders, the Electoral College, the media and innumerable other villains. Hillary has never owned up to having been a widely distrusted, politically inept and arrogant candidate who simply lost an election.

It’s unfortunate, because her inability to take responsibility for the unexpected 2016 loss has helped divide the country and has also made her a laughing stock. Unlike most former candidates, Hillary has seen her approval ratings drop since her campaign, and especially among Democrats. In September 2018, two years after the election, Clinton’s approval stood at 36 percent, an all-time low, and seven points below her ratings on the cusp of the 2016 vote. Among Democrats, her approval was down 11 points.

After 17 years of being voted the most admired woman in the country, Hillary has fallen behind Michelle Obama and is tied with Melania Trump. Boy, that must rankle.

Blame her interminable and whiny book, endless embarrassing speaking tours meant to keep her in the public eye and fluff up her already-copious bank account, and renewed scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation, which, not surprisingly, deflated as donors disappeared.

But mainly, blame her inability to move on, which has prompted her peculiar attack on Gabbard. The animus between the two is not new; in 2016, Gabbard committed the unforgivable sin of endorsing Bernie Sanders. At the time, Gabbard was vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, which has been accused of tipping the primary contest to Hillary. Her apostasy, consequently, was profound.

Some have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm.

Gabbard has also challenged Hillary, and the Democratic establishment, on foreign policy. When the Iraq war veteran came out in favor of Bernie, Gabbard described Hillary as someone who “will lead us into more interventionist wars of regime change.”

Gabbard has fired back at Clinton’s Russia comments, calling her the “queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long….”

Gabbard claims her camp has detected a “concerted campaign to destroy my reputation” and now believes that Hillary, “through her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose” is behind that effort.

The assertion seems far-fetched; why would Hillary Clinton bother to take down a fellow Democrat who is so far behind the pack?

Maybe because in her bitterness Hillary cannot endure anyone else – and especially another female – campaigning and possibly winning in 2020.

Gabbard has suggested as much, tweeting “It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me… Join the race directly.”

Some have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm. Like many Democrats, she may consider Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is quickly becoming the favorite, too extreme to win a national election against Donald Trump.

In a recent interview with PBS’ Judy Woodruff, Clinton said, ""So maybe there does need to be a re-match. I mean, obviously I can beat him again."" She later said she was joking.

Recently, baited to jump in by President Trump on Twitter Hillary responded “Don’t tempt me. Do your job.”

Before she enters the race, Hillary should review what voters are saying about another run. A recent Rasmussen poll shows that fully 71 percent of voters say she should not run, including 58 percent of her own party. That’s not a great starting point.

Though Hillary is quite positive she would win, suggesting in a CBS interview that “there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again,” the Rasmussen survey tells a different story.

In that poll, she ties Trump in a head-to-head match-up. But remember that on the eve of the 2016 election the polling was unequivocally in her favor. At that time The Daily Beast posted a jubilant column, “Hillary Clinton Leads All Final Polls,” noting a Monmouth poll had the former Secretary of State up by 6 points, while a tracking poll by ABC News and the Washington Post had her ahead by 4 points. It may be, given the apparent bias in Trump surveys, that running even is not good enough.

Three other findings should give her pause. The first is that in that imaginary contest, Clinton wins only 60 percent of the black vote. In 2016, she walked away with 88 percent of that vote. That possible leakage of black votes, which I’ve noted before, is a real danger sign for Hillary, and for Democrats.

Second, only 42 percent of those surveyed think the country would be better off today if Clinton had been elected. Fully 48 percent disagree. That’s an astonishing conclusion, given the daily battering the president receives from the media and his low job approval ratings.

Finally, only 54 percent of Democrats think Hillary won the nomination in 2016 fairly. Imagine the reaction is she was to jump in today, or if she were to be nominated by a deadlocked convention. The remaining dozen or so candidates, and their supporters, would erupt; most likely, a great many would stay home.

It’s time for Hillary to retire to the sidelines. Stop embarrassing Democrats, and herself.

* In a bit of a surprise, CNN’s new national poll found Joe Biden leading Elizabeth Warren, 34% to 19%, in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. A month ago, Biden led Warren by a smaller margin, 24% to 18%. Bernie Sanders was third in the latest poll with 16%, down a point since CNN’s September poll.

* The same poll found Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke tied for sixth place with 3% each, which is important because it brings each of them a little closer to qualifying for next month’s primary debate. (The Minnesota senator needs just one more poll at 3% or greater to become eligible.)

* Speaking of polling, a new Quinnipiac poll, for the first time, found that a 48% plurality of Americans support impeaching Donald Trump and removing him from office. The same poll found the president with a 38% approval rating, down three points from the last Quinnipiac survey.

* In yet another poll, Emerson offered Bernie Sanders better news: it found Biden with a narrow lead over the Vermont senator nationally, 27% to 25%, with Warren close behind with 21%.

* Speaking of Warren, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney (D) endorsed the Massachusetts senator this morning. He’s the first big-city mayor to publicly announce his support for Warren.

* With only two weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, William Woods, a Republican who ran against Gov. Matt Bevin in a GOP primary, this week announced his support for the governor’s Democratic challenger, state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D). “This election isn’t about politics for me,” Woods said on Monday night. “I’m ready for a governor who will respect all of us regardless of political affiliation.”

* Kansas Democrats’ U.S. Senate primary got a little more straightforward a few days ago, when former U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom ended his campaign and endorsed state Sen. Barbara Bollier (D). Bollier is perhaps best known as the former Republican who left the party over its radicalism.

* And the Washington Post’s Eugene Scott noted late yesterday that while some of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s (D-Hawaii) 2020 rivals have defended her from claims that she’s a Russian asset, “some have argued that Gabbard doesn’t have to be proactively working with Russia for that government to be using her campaign to interfere in the 2020 election.”"

""Odd lot"" trades — or stock trades involving fewer than 100 shares — are becoming more commonplace, making up nearly half of all trades in early October, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited New York Stock Exchange data.

The shift has been driven by a steady rise in average share prices and surging popularity of algorithmic trading.

Trading programs often cut large exchanges into smaller segments spread out over time, and expensive stocks require more cash for high-volume trades.

The shift from round-lot trades — those made in multiples of 100 shares — could require new market regulation, as odd-lot trades aren't shown on public data feeds and aren't used in exchanges' best price quotes.

""Odd lot"" trades — stock purchases or sales involving fewer than 100 shares — now make up nearly half of all trades after doubling since 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing New York Stock Exchange data.

The small trades were previously a small segment of all stock transfers, making up just over 20% of trades five years ago. Yet an increase in high-price stocks and automated trading programs drove a surge in odd-lot exchanges. The proportion of trades in that size reached a record 48.9% on October 7 and has stayed above 40% since, according to WSJ.

While no S&P 500 companies traded above $1,000 per share in 2012, five now do, including Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet. The record-long bull market has inflated the rest of the market, with the average price of stocks in the S&P 500 more than tripling since 2009, according to Strategas Research data cited by WSJ.

The move to higher prices leads investors to have to hand over more upfront for trades involving multiples of 100 shares, also known as ""round lot"" trades.

The influx of technology and programming into the once trader-dominated stock market has also driven up the popularity of odd-lot exchanges.

Algorithmic trading often divides large sales or purchases into smaller segments to spread out a trade and avoid a large price change that could alert other investors. Though banks used to cut large trades into round-lot exchanges, they're increasingly using odd-lot trades for segmented orders, according to WSJ.

""We now live in a world of algos and slicing and dicing,"" Cornell University finance professor Maureen O'Hara told WSJ.

The shift from round-lot trades presents a few issues in the slow-to-change world of market regulation. For instance, odd-lot quotes aren't shown on public data feeds, allowing the small trades to go hidden from many investors' fields of view.

Brokers also face challenges born from the shift to odd-lots. The firms are obligated to execute trades at the best price posted on an exchange, but the prices are taken only by round-lot quotes. Best price quotes could become less accurate if the trend continues, as odd-lot trades would account for more of a stock's price movement.

My life experience made me a Republican. Growing up I witnessed firsthand the poverty and destruction government policies had on my people and my peoples’ land -- the Indian reservation.

Overlapping, paternalistic federal and state programs, including fully funded and inefficient healthcare, dominate the reservations’ economies. The restrictions the government places on land use, ownership and business development are microcosms of socialist failure in its purest form.

The government “help” has never encouraged financial self-sufficiency. If anything, the programs have been a disincentive to economic freedom and prosperity.

While I firmly believe all Americans should benefit from a safety net, I also know government handouts are never as powerful as a hand up. The federal government set up the reservations more than 100 years ago and, just like liberal democrats today, created these subsidized economies because they think they know what’s best for us.

The result of more than 100 years of government assistance is Indian Reservations drowning in poverty. These well-intended programs have made our people the poorest Americans. Some reservations have unemployment rates close to 85 percent, and 29 percent of employed Native Americans nationwide live below the poverty level.

To improve peoples’ lives we can’t force them to rely on the government. Tax cuts and the free-market economy foster growth and opportunity, creating jobs and lifting the poor out of poverty.

Is it a perfect system? No, but to see more families prosper and have better opportunities, free-market economic policies, especially tax cuts, are proven to work. Socialist government-controlled economies, with handouts and higher taxes, only lead to poverty and misery.

Today, the U.S. unemployment rate is at its the lowest point in 50 years. The jobless rate for Hispanics hit a record low of 3.9 percent in September. African Americans maintained their lowest rate ever at 5.5 percent and adult women came in at 3.1 percent.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in 2020, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus argued on Tuesday.

During an exclusive interview with Fox News, the longtime political strategist argued that Warren was too caught up in policy, not relatable enough, and so extreme that she would drive voters to support Trump.

""Without question,"" he would choose Warren as Trump's opponent. ""It's just this outlandish worldview that Elizabeth Warren has that will drive people that may not be thrilled with everything that President Trump is doing -- but under the circumstances of being given a choice between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, they're going to go with Donald Trump.""

""It's incredible how badly the Democratic party is screwing this up for themselves. It's amazing. They've got one left-wing nut after the next on television,"" he told Fox News.

WATCH: ELIZABETH WARREN DODGES QUESTION ON HOW SHE WOULD FUND 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

His comments came just days before he's set to sit down at Politicon with Fox News contributor Donna Brazile who, like Priebus, served as chair of her respective party during the 2016 presidential election. He will expand on the atmosphere surrounding 2020 and talk about the direction of the country. Priebus will also participate in a panel on Republicans’ electoral prospects following Trump’s first term at Politicon.

Voters in the U.S., Priebus told Fox, mostly weren't concerned with policies like reparations or ""Medicare for all."" Instead, they focused on issues like manufacturing and jobs. Priebus argued that voters would have a harder time deciding between Trump and candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, or Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was a ""close second"" behind Warren for Priebus' chosen nominee. “He’s a little Trumpy … I think his rhetoric flows well, better than Elizabeth Warren, with blue-collar workers in the midwest -- kind of his middle finger type philosophy to just a lot of things that folks claim is unfair,"" he said of Sanders.

According to Priebus, Trump and Republicans were ""brilliant"" to focus on the Democrats' more progressive elements like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her ""squad"" of progressive freshmen. “There’s nothing more you want to do than give people a stark contrast in the ballot box -- so when people go to vote, they want to see night and day as far as a choice,"" he said.

He added that ""extreme"" Democratic policies in Washington, D.C., were making it more likely that reluctant Trump donors would pull out their checkbook and support his re-election.

But none of the party's frontrunners, he argued, were able to appeal to both a progressive base and midwestern voters. And although Biden was the more likable Democrat, he wasn't credible on left-wing policies, Priebus said.

""So, they have nothing. They don’t have a complete candidate who can do both which is why you’re seeing people like [Michael] Bloomberg dipping his toe in, you saw the poll last week about Michelle Obama -- that she would be the frontrunner. The Democrats are desperate,"" he said.

Biden's prospects, Priebus added, were much worse than Trump's were during the 2016 primaries. He argued that Trump ""was never really behind"" and, as a consequence, Republican National Committee delegates didn't have anywhere to go other than supporting Trump.

Biden, on the other hand, could face a brokered convention where he may need to shore up progressives due to the nature of Democratic politics. Democrats, he said, had “real tight race among three or four people and they also shell out most of their delegates on a proportional basis at their conventions … and in their primary battles.”

Priebus also put the kibosh on any chance that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton could enter the race and win in 2020. ""I think she's pretty much-damaged goods at this point,"" he said. He argued that Warren faced the same flaw that Clinton did in 2016: neither were ""likable.""

Trump, he added, delivered on his promise to ""blow things up"" in Washington and was immune to the controversies that would doom any other politician. “He’s judged by the American people on a different standard. He’s immune from all of these controversies.""

On impeachment, Priebus argued that the president should continue playing ""the victim card"" and attacking the way Democrats handled it -- something he described as a ""sham."" Impeachment, he predicted, could turn out to be a boon for Trump, especially since the Ukraine controversy implicated Biden."

Elizabeth Warren once railed against class warfare and defended the rich in an op-ed she penned way back in 2004 -- a column that underscores her striking transformation over the years into a leading antagonist of the so-called ""1 percent.""

The op-ed, titled “The Vital Middle,” was published on July 16, 2004, as part of a special report from The American Prospect on then-Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.

ELISA MARTINEZ: IF WARREN UNDERSTOOD NATIVE AMERICANS, SHE'D KNOW SOCIALISM DOESN'T WORK

The Massachusetts Democrat, who was a Harvard Law School professor at the time, used the piece to offer advice to Kerry. Some of the viewpoints are familiar—like going after corporate welfare and pushing health insurance for all—but others seem far more moderate than Warren’s current attitude toward the wealthy.

“It is not about class warfare,” Warren wrote. “The rich are not the enemy—in fact, most of us would like to be rich.”

“Corruption and misplaced priorities are the enemy. And the poor are not the only ones who have problems, so don’t talk as if they are the only ones who deserve compassion,” she continued.

“Americans risk fracturing into disparate groups, jealously guarding whatever benefits we have gained, pursuing separate identities instead of the country’s shared identity as part of one great American middle class,” she wrote. “That makes us nervous. Lead from the middle, because a middle-focused agenda helps all Americans, including our poor and our wealthy.”

In the piece, Warren went on to share somewhat of a Republican talking point -- blasting ""welfare cheats,"" while also maintaining her familiar stance of fighting against ""corporate welfare"" that favors ""well-connected mega-businesses and political friends.""

""Stand for fair play--not handouts, not special interests--just plain, old-fashioned, everyone-plays-by-the-same- rules,"" she wrote. ""Reject welfare cheats, corporate cheats, or cheats of any other stripe. Speak to us of fundamental fairness, and we will believe again in what we can be.""

But fast-forward to the present—and Warren, who is now a leader in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, has changed her tune.

One of her core policies is a wealth tax -- a 2 percent annual tax on the wealth of individuals with more than $50 million, and a 3 percent tax on the wealth of those with over $1 billion.

She said during last week's Democratic primary debate that ""taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does,"" and added that ""the rich are not like you and me.""

Warren sharply criticized the wealthy at the debate, saying ""the way we're going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they're making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind.""

Warren critics cited the 2004 op-ed as a sign of inconsistency.

""Yet more evidence of Elizabeth Warren being dishonest and disingenuous about her record? What a shock,"" a Trump campaign official said.

""'Welfare cheats' is a Republican talking point that does violence to people--particularly communities of color--who have been failed by the corporate-dominated policies that Senator Warren apparently had an epiphany about not that long ago,"" a Democratic strategist told Fox News. ""We deserve a nominee who's been committed to systematic change for their entire career.""

When she announced her 2020 candidacy, Warren also said it was time to ""fight back"" against the wealthy.

Her campaign has not responded to a Fox News request for comment on the 2004 piece.

Warren, meanwhile, would qualify as wealthy herself, with a reported net worth of $12 million."

But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall.

Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent. The populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid stood at 10 percent in the previous survey.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who stood at 12 percent in the July survey, saw her support drop in half and now comes in at 6 percent in the new poll.

Environmental and progressive advocate and former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer has the backing of 4 percent of likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 3 percent, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. The remaining nine candidates in the record-setting Democratic presidential field all register at 1 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Besides the topline findings, the poll also has warning signs for Biden among South Carolina’s black voters, who make up more than half of the likely Democratic primary electorate. The former vice president’s position as either a first- or second-choice candidate dropped by 10 points among black voters to 52 percent, while Warren’s position as a top-two choice contender jumped 11 points to 26 percent.

“Biden is still in a pretty good position in South Carolina, but there are some signs that he might not have a true firewall among black voters. If he does not do well in the earlier contests in February, there may be potential for current preferences to shift here,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted Oct. 16-21, with 402 South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

Robert Torricelli told “America’s Newsroom” Wednesday that nominating former Vice President Joe Biden as the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee would be problematic due to the lingering questions about his son's financial dealings with Ukraine and China.

“The problem Democrats are facing in this race is that if Joe Biden is the nominee, Hunter Biden becomes 'Hillary Clinton’s emails,'” Torricelli said, predicting that the side issue will dog his campaign as it did for the former secretary of state in 2016.

Torricelli’s comments came after a new CNN national poll showed Biden leading the field following a recent dip. According to the poll conducted by the market research firm SSRS, Biden has the support of 34 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his widest margin since his campaign officially launched on April 25.

Torricelli said he still views Warren as the front-runner and believes national poll numbers ""will correct themselves.""

""There is a Democratic core sympathy for Biden for what he has gone through that has boosted his numbers. This is still, in my opinion, an Elizabeth Warren race. She's the only one with the organization, she's got the money, she's got the message, she is focused,"" he said.

Last week, Hunter Biden broke his silence since his relationship with companies in Ukraine and China came under scrutiny.

In a nationally televised interview, Biden maintained he did nothing improper while he served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Biden, 49, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Biden said he did not discuss the Burisma Holdings board seat with his father, except for one ""brief exchange"" that was previously reported.

GABBARD REVEALS WHY SHE THINKS CLINTON IS 'SMEARING' HER

""Tulsi Gabbard, much like President Trump, does not take guff from anyone and, unlike many of her Democratic cohorts and competitors, she refuses to kiss the Clinton ring,"" continued Lahren on her show ""Final Thoughts.""

Clinton kicked off a fight with Gabbard by suggesting that the Army National Guard major, who served two tours in the Middle East, is secretly in league with the Russian government.

TRUMP DEFENDS GABBARD, SUGGESTS CLINTON IS 'SICK'

Appearing on the podcast of a former aide to President Barack Obama, Clinton said, in remarks widely interpreted to be in reference to Gabbard, ""I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians.""

""This, coming from Ms. Crooked, email-deleting, Benghazi lying, pay-for-play Clinton Foundation, failed Russia restart, Hillary Clinton?"" remarked Lahren. ""For her to accuse anybody of being crooked, corrupt, or anything of the sort is so unbelievably tone-deaf and painfully ironic.""

""It’s no question Hillary has it out for Tulsi. The question is why,"" she continued.

""First, Hillary is the leader of the war hawk war party,"" offered Lahren. ""She, along with many neocon Republicans, has been a cheerleader for endless conflict, foreign intervention and the very regime change wars that Tulsi Gabbard rallies against.""

""Secondly,"" said Lahren, ""Hillary may still have bad blood with her over the 2016 Bernie Sanders endorsement. Hillary holding a grudge? Shocking, I know.""

However, Lahren said that she believes the most significant factor driving Clinton to attempt to undermine Gabbard is that ""Tulsi will not fall in line.""

TRUMP REIGNITES FEUD WITH HILLARY CLINTON

""Tulsi is the only Democratic contender willing to directly call out Hillary and the Clinton dynasty. The Clinton regime does not tolerate dissent. They do not tolerate Democrats who don’t fall in line.""

In response to Clinton's accusation, Gabbard tweeted at the former first lady, calling her ""the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long...""

""Even Elizabeth Warren falls in line,"" alleged Lahren.

Indeed, Newsweek reported, ""Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, both tier-one candidates, have remained largely silent on the issue."" Additionally, the Biden campaign outright declined to comment on Clinton's remarks on Monday.

In the most pointed response yet, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., tweeted, ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset."" Notably, Sanders did not mention Clinton by name.

""I don’t know if she’s truly cozy with the Russians or not, but I for damn sure believe it’s her refusal to be cozy with the Clintons that has incurred the wrath of Hillary,"" said Lahren.

""The good news for Tulsi is, outside of the establishment elites, the D.C. beltway brats and the swamp — no one cares what Hillary has to say,"" she concluded.

""Honestly, if Hillary Clinton were to make her grand reentrance, now would be about the time she should do it,"" he said. ""Because the fact is, a lot of people are dissatisfied with [Joe] Biden. A lot of people are dissatisfied with [Elizabeth] Warren and Hillary is an enormous name.""

McEnany said the reports of Clinton considering another run show the weakness of the current field, which includes and ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden and ""radical socialism"" from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. She predicted that Warren will be the nominee and the race will be ""the case for socialism versus President Trump"" and his strong economic policies."

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan non-profit, tried estimating the revenue created by eliminating multiple deductions, doubling the corporate income tax rate to 42 percent (it was 35 percent before President Trump's tax cut), raising financial transaction taxes, and raising the top two individual income tax rates to 70 percent.

It found that doing so would only cover 40 percent of the 10-year cost of ""Medicare for All"" -- estimated at $30 trillion -- with roughly $11 trillion in raised revenue. If the next president relied on just income tax hikes, it would be ""impossible"" to fund the plan, even if the government took 100 percent of the rich's income.

The authors cautioned that their estimates were ""very rough"" and ""didn't account for many interactions and economic feedback.""

DNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR PRESSED ON HOW $34T 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN WILL BE PAID

The study came as several 2020 Democrats proposed a single-payer program like ""Medicare for All."" At the fourth Democratic debate in October, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was pressed on her continual refusal to state whether her plan would require middle-class tax cuts.

""Regardless of the overall impact of Medicare-for-All, it is clear that taxes on the middle class would have to rise in order to pay for it,"" the study read.

While Warren has been unclear about taxes, she's committed not to sign legislation that will raise costs for the middle class while lowering them for the wealthy. That's likely a reference to a net decrease that would purportedly result from lowering costs for health care in a greater amount than the increase in taxes.

Tuesday's study acknowledged that median costs would likely fall, although it's unclear whether total costs will increase or decrease.

""There is simply not enough available revenue from high earners and businesses to cover the full cost of eliminating premiums, ending all cost-sharing, and expanding coverage to all Americans and for (virtually) all health services,"" the study read. ""But in exchange, the absence of premiums and cost-sharing could represent a net gain or loss to individuals' finances depending on how much they currently pay, how much they currently make, and how the ultimate financing is structured.""

While it remains unclear how Warren will raise the necessary revenue, she pledged on Sunday to release a plan with more details."

Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" plan.

The Massachusetts Democrat and White House candidate said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ""What I see… is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of 'Medicare-for-all,' and specifically how we pay for it.""

Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ""Medicare-for-all"" plans at $32-34 trillion.

""It's mystifying that for someone who has put having a plan for everything at the center of her pitch to voters, Senator Warren has decided to release a health care plan only after enduring immense public pressure for refusing to do so,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said later.

""We hope her plan will be straight with the American people about how much middle-class taxes will go up to pay for the $30+ trillion it will take to fund"" the plan, he added.

Francis said the math is impossible.

“If you took away every single dollar [from someone] who makes more than $200,000 and you threw them in the abyss somewhere to die it still won’t pay for 'Medicare-for-all,'” Francis said.

Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said Monday that some of his GOP colleagues in the Senate privately tell him how ""horrified"" they are by President Trump's behavior.

Appearing on CNN, Bennet was asked if he heard more ""private"" support for Trump from Republican lawmakers than what was known publicly. Bennet insisted it was quite the opposite.

""They’re horrified that he invited Ukraine to interfere in our elections, they are horrified that the chief of staff admitted it was a quid pro quo. They're particularly horrified by what president did in northern Syria by abandoning the Kurds there, something I think there's a consensus in the Senate -- no other president in history would have done,"" Bennet elaborated. ""We have to stand up to tyrants here and abroad... That's why we have to make America America again.""

BETO O'ROURKE INSISTS TRUMP IS A 'RUSSIAN ASSET' AMID CLINTON-GABBARD FEUD

He added, ""We’ve had enough of this guy and I do think their president -- Republicans in the Senate, who are getting awfully tired of having to defend him.""

Trump frequently has denied doing anything improper in his July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart. Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday denied his comments last week about withholding aid money to Ukraine constituted a quid pro quo. On Turkey's Syria incursion, the president said over the weekend: ""We are not a policing agent... It is time for us to go home.""

Bennet has long been struggling to gain traction on the campaign trail, polling at just one percent in the latest Fox News Poll. The Colorado lawmaker failed to meet the requirements to participate in the Democrats' last two debates and likely will not qualify for the next debate in November.

During the interview, he also went after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who he said was ""not being honest"" about how she would fund ""Medicare-for-all."" Warren has pledged to reveal how the U.S. would pay for it soon, amid concerns from critics that it could involve a tax hike for the middle class.

""I think that her plan, which costs $33 trillion, is the equivalent of 70 percent of all the taxes that the federal government will collect over the next ten years,"" Bennet continued. ""It hasn't been explained to the American people. It's a sound bite, and more than that, it's not based on common sense."""

""When you hear firsthand from people from Venezuela or Cuba who have dealt with socialism, who've been driven from their countries, who've dealt with the poverty and the instability it brings to their government, I think it really resonates. So we've launched VictimsOfSocialism.org so we can hear their stories firsthand and it is very powerful,"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on ""Fox & Friends.""

The ""Victims of Socialism"" campaign features a montage, as well as individual videos, of several people warning about socialism after their home nation spun into civil and economic disarray. It's the result of a monthslong effort by the RNC to highlight the dangers that could result from Democratic victories in 2020.

""The American people need to protect the United States from the socialist politics,"" a man identified as Amed G. says in the video.

SANDERS EMBRACES DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, CALLS FOR NEW DEAL REVIVAL IN CAMPAIGN ADDRESS

""It's crazy. It's incredible. With the socialists, [they] take your liberties and offer little candies. It's all free,"" he said before the video jumped to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., calling for ""free tuition.""

""Victims of Socialism"" represents a broader, apparent strategy by the RNC to tag Democrats with the more left-wing positions that gained steam during the Democratic primary. While the ad mostly targets Democratic candidates like Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., it also points to how a slew of 2020 candidates – including former Vice President Joe Biden, a perceived moderate – have committed to free health care for illegal immigrants.

The ad came as Biden looked less like the presumptive nominee and Warren gained ground in polling for key states. Warren maintains that she's capitalist, although she espouses many of the same policies as Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — both self-described ""Democratic socialists."" Sanders, who often polls in the top three among Democrats, also enjoyed a raucous rally last week in which progressive icon, Ocasio-Cortez, threw her weight behind him.

The new campaign aims to reinforce the longstanding criticism that socialism is a dream with plans that are divorced from reality.

""The socialist person, the socialist people. They are very good poets and they are very good in oratory,"" Warner M., a former Venezuelan mayor, explained.

After shifting to a clip of Ocasio-Cortez giving an impassioned speech, a woman appeared to describe how she and others made a terrible mistake in ignoring warnings about socialism.

""Of course, we made a terrible mistake. You know? We didn't listen. Many people warned us and said ... 'you need to stop this' and 'you do not need to go for this.' And unfortunately, we made the error of saying, 'that's not going to happen in Venezuela,"" said Karla N., who also left Venezuela.

Warner M. added that socialism begets leaders who are focused on ""how to maintain power.""

Echoing one of the men in the video, McDaniel said Tuesday that the Democratic candidates are ""promising free things like candy"" in order to regain power and urged voters to listen to warnings from others who have lived through socialist governments."

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT REACHES NEW HIGH

Quinnipiac University: “Approval among American voters of the U.S. House impeachment inquiry, an inquiry to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against President Trump, has reached its highest level, as 55 percent approve of the inquiry, while 43 percent disapprove, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Last week, 51 percent of voters approved of the inquiry, while 45 percent disapproved. In today's poll, Democrats approve of the inquiry 93 - 7 percent and independent voters approve 58 - 37 percent, while Republicans disapprove of the inquiry 88 - 10 percent. … Nearly half of registered voters, 48 percent, say President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46 percent say he should not. Last week, 46 percent supported impeachment while 48 percent were opposed. In today's poll, support for impeachment is 86 - 9 percent among Democrats, and 49 - 41 percent among independents, while Republicans oppose impeachment 91 - 6 percent.”



Trump approval dropping - Quinnipiac University: “President Trump’s job approval rating has dipped below 40 percent for the first time since the impeachment inquiry began as 38 percent say they approve of the job he is doing, and 58 percent disapprove. Last week, 41 percent approved of the president’s job performance, while 54 percent disapproved. This is President Trump’s lowest net approval rating since a July 2018 poll. … Nancy Pelosi gets a mixed approval rating as 45 percent approve of the job she is doing as Speaker of the House, while 47 percent disapprove. Mitch McConnell’s approval rating is deep underwater as 57 percent of voters disapprove of the job he is doing as Senate Majority Leader, while only 24 percent approve.”



Top diplomat’s testimony rattles Congress - NYT: “[During] explosive testimony on Tuesday, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, laid out in visceral terms the stakes of what he saw as an illegitimate scheme to pressure the Kiev government for political help by suspending American security aid. In by far the most damning account yet to become public in the House impeachment inquiry Mr. Taylor described a president holding up $391 million in assistance for the clear purpose of forcing Ukraine to help incriminate Mr. Trump’s domestic rivals. Mr. Trump’s actions, he testified, undercut American allies desperately fighting off Russia’s attempt to redraw the boundaries of Europe through force.”



Trump defenders storm deposition, shut down probe in protest - WaPo: “A group of House Republicans temporarily shut down the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, barging into a secure room where a witness was set to testify and refusing to leave despite orders from top Democrats. A group of about two-dozen Trump allies stormed a room in the Capitol basement where three investigative committees were supposed to hear testimony from Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy. Those members were not on the committees of jurisdiction and were not supposed to be present during the closed-door deposition. A shouting match began between Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) and some Democrats in the room as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) left to consult with the sergeant at arms…”



Senate Republicans caution Trump on chaos - WashEx: “Senate Republicans are warning President Trump that he risks bungling impeachment politically and alienating voters, even as he survives a Senate trial, without a focused strategy prosecuted by competent political professionals. With House Democrats expected to approve articles of impeachment by Christmas, Senate Republicans are bracing for the trial, and they are imploring Trump to appreciate the gravity of the situation and prepare. Angry tweets and belligerent news conferences are not sufficient. The president is not in danger of losing anywhere near enough Republican support to be removed from office. But without an effective defense against the Democrats’ charges on the Senate floor, voters might conclude impeachment was justified and oust him in 2020.”



Biden called Clinton impeachment 'lynching' - Fox News: “Even as top Democrats rushed to condemn President Trump's comparison of their impeachment inquiry to a ‘lynching,’ footage and news reports have emerged showing several top Democrats referring matter-of-factly to Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings as a ‘lynching’ in 1998. Among those Democrats are two African-American representatives still serving in the House, as well as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and presidential contender Joe Biden. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., called Clinton's impeachment a ‘persecution’ and a ‘political lynching’ on the House floor in 1998. And Danny Davis, D-Ill., condemned what he described as a ‘lynching in the People's House.’ Biden, who has condemned Trump's remarks as ‘abhorrent’ and ‘despicable,’ said in 1998 that a Clinton impeachment could be perceived as a ‘partisan lynching.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS

“The language of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her constitution declares, ‘that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct; so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly.’” – James Madison, Federalist No. 47



TIME OUT: BETTER LATE THAN NEVER

Smithsonian: “Leonardo da Vinci wasn’t known for getting things done. He was often years or even decades late when delivering paintings, and many of the fantastical schemes he concocted… Still, new research conducted by engineers at MIT suggests one of the Renaissance giant’s unbuilt designs—a bridge poised to be the world’s longest—would have worked if the artist had actually followed through on his plans. Leonardo drafted his proposal in response to Sultan Bayezid II’s 1502 appeal for bridge designs. Bayezid, ruler of the Ottoman Empire, wanted to connect the cities of Constantinople and Galata, which were separated by a river estuary called the Golden Horn. … Bayezid was unimpressed by Leonardo’s complicated blueprints, and the bridge the artist envisioned was never built—at least until MIT engineer John Ochsendorf stepped in to test the 500-year-old design’s feasibility. …Ochsendorf and his colleagues analyzed materials available in 1502 and determined the Old Master would probably have used stone rather than wood or brick…”

BIDEN BOOMING

CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president has rebounded, and now stands at its widest margin since April, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%. … Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups’ Biden leads the President by 10 points…”



Still rolling in South Carolina - Monmouth University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner among likely Democratic voters in South Carolina. The Monmouth University Poll finds little has changed in overall presidential primary support, but there is evidence that black voters’ preference for the front-runner varies significantly when age and education are taken into account. Biden currently holds 33% support among South Carolina voters who are likely to vote in the February 2020 Democratic primary. … Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (16%) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (12%) are in the second tier of candidate preferences. … California Sen. Kamala Harris has 6% support… Tom Steyer (4%), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Video shows Warren waffling on Medicare - Mediaite: “Massachusetts Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren backed off of Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan in leaked video of a private meeting with union officials, saying ‘it’s not that I have a plan that says we’re going to do this part and then we’re going to do this part,’ but that ‘we’re going to get to a table like this.’ Warren has vacillated between being ‘with Bernie’ on his health care plan and considering it a mere ‘framework,’ and most recently told CNN’s David Axelrod that Bernie’s plan is ‘my plan.’ But Mediaite has obtained leaked video from an August 23 meeting with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union executive board in which Warren is considerably more vague about the plan.”



Massachusans like Warren, but not so much her health plan - WBUR: “In the race for her party's presidential nomination, home state U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has opened up a wide lead among likely Democratic primary voters in Massachusetts, according to a new WBUR poll. … But the WBUR poll also has a note of caution for Warren. Medicare for All … is less popular among likely Democratic voters in this blue state than a plan that would include a public option… According to the survey, Warren leads a crowded Democratic field, with 33% of likely voters in the primary supporting her. Former Vice President Joe Biden is second with 18%, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is at 13%, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is in fourth place with 7%. Fifteen percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their answer. While Warren probably benefits from home-field advantage, the poll is the latest in a series of recent surveys that show her moving to front-runner status.



HOW TEAM TRUMP MADE RALLIES DATA MINING MACHINES

WSJ: “The most transformational change has been turning rallies into large-scale data-mining operations. The Trump campaign has collected millions of phone numbers, email addresses and other personal information supporters hand over when signing up for text alerts or registering for rally tickets. The Trump team uses the data to reveal people’s political registrations and in which elections they have voted. Then the team cross-references that information with data on their consumer habits—already collected by the Republican Party—to forecast how likely each rallygoer is to vote in 2020 and which candidate the voter will probably support, campaign officials said. A yet-to-be released smartphone app will offer supporters certain perks, such as accelerated entry into rallies, in exchange for putting the campaign in contact with friends who might back the president and hand over personal data.”



Dem PAC spends big bashing Trump in key general election states - Axios: “A major outside Democratic group is outspending President Trump on Facebook ads in the crucial battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Why it matters: 2020 presidential candidates have spent at least $61 million so far this cycle on Facebook and Google ads, with Trump in the lead, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. But that's national spending. The state-by-state spend (below) is important because that's where the 2020 election will be won. … Meanwhile, Priorities USA — a major Democratic super PAC — launched a digital ad campaign in late July ‘focused on holding President Trump accountable’ and highlighting how his economic policies have negatively affected some Americans. The group spent $40 million online in 2016 and they said they plan to spend more than that in 2020.”



Dick’s CEO tries on the idea of a presidential run - Politico: “Ed Stack, the CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is testing the waters for a possible third-party presidential bid that could scramble the dynamics of the 2020 general election. Various messages were presented to a focus group in southern Wisconsin this week centering on the billionaire businessman, along with possible three-way match-ups against Donald Trump and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. The focus group, according to a source who took part in the testing, ran through varying themes involving Stack and heavily focused on his example of ‘showing leadership’ by halting the sale of assault-style rifles at all of Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in the wake of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida.”



GOP HOLDS NARROW EDGE FOR MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR

Mississippi Clarion Ledger: “A new poll shows the Mississippi gubernatorial race remains tight with less than two weeks to Election Day. It also found a majority of voters oppose impeaching and removing President Donald Trump from office. … Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves leading Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood 46% to 43%. 2% support third-party candidates Bob Hickingbottom or Dave Singletary … Other recent polls have shown a similarly competitive race, closer than any state governor contest since 2003. Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2004. Mason-Dixon pollsters indicated Trump's scheduled Nov. 1 rally in Tupelo ‘could be a deciding factor’ and offer a ‘significant boost’ for Reeves with GOP turnout. They noted Trump's last-minute campaigning in Louisiana recently helped force incumbent Democrat John Bel Edwards into a runoff.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I’m at the point where I may hibernate this winter and avoid at all costs any media news. There are so many things I find biased, crooked and overblown, most of all the vendetta against the president. I resent the focus on this as opposed to a new trade policy, immigration reform, poor reports on education in the US, drugs and so many urgent items. Trump wasn’t my first choice for president in 2016, but I supported him when nominated. I don’t care nearly as much about his horrible personality as I do about his policies and the things he’s accomplished. … The polls say ‘Impeach! Elect Socialists! Elect people who are not only corrupt but suffering from delusions or dementia.’ I’m old, cranky and tired of the idiocy. Boo hiss.” – Susan Williams, St. Louis

“Something that is not talked about is, if college tuition became free in the United States is it reasonable for a college student to believe they can choose their college and/or major? One of the casualties of big socialized governments is there is no mechanism to afford personal individuality, uniqueness or desire. Everyone is treated the same. It then seems a reasonable conclusion that all students who want free college tuition to be tested, the government decide what the student demonstrates high aptitude in and the government choses the school and/or major for that student. This would be based on how the government decides the student can best serve the masses, not the individual student’s desires. In the United States we generally believe in mutually beneficial transactions. Meaning, both parties to a transaction receive something. One party receives the quantity and quality of a good or service, the other receives money. Both parties win. It would be a sea change to believe the student would receive both; free education and the choice of where to go and what to major in.” – Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.



[Ed. note: Well, we do already kind of dabble in that. The federal government provides special incentives for students to choose certain disciplines and for institutions to choose certain types of students – directing research funds to preferred research, creating incentives for encouraging women into STEM, etc. But I take your larger point. If a four-year college degree becomes like high school is now, i.e. a guaranteed good available to all residents, one imagines that the government will take a similarly strong interest in what colleges teach and what students will earn. We have already seen it through the pressures applied to schools via Pell Grants and other forms of funding. But leaving aside the consideration of funding, which is a lulu, the main concern about universal college is that it will diminish the value of college for those who do attend. One of the reasons college has been such a great ladder into the middle class is that it isn’t for everyone. About a third of Americans over 25 have at least a four-year degree. But for Americans over 65, it’s only about a quarter of the population. It stands to reason that new graduates holding college degrees 40 years ago were more valuable than those today. What happens if we see college-going rates soar to 60 percent or more? There are lots of good things about higher education (and plenty of bad things, too). But many of the good things are not about what happens in the classroom – socialization, training in independent living in a controlled atmosphere, a sense of cultural belonging. Those things may or may not be degraded in a world of universal college. But the value of a degree, and thereby its utility for upward socioeconomic mobility, certainly would.]

Bloomberg: “America is sitting on a mountain of uneaten bacon. More than 40 million pounds (18,000 metric tons) of pork bellies, the cut used for bacon making, were sitting in refrigerated warehouses as of Sept. 30, according to U.S. government data released Tuesday. That’s the most for the month since 1971. The overhang came after a buildup in the American hog herd. Pork output surged over the summer months and through September, said Dennis Smith, senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. Bellies have seen a magnified inventory increase because demand is mostly domestic, unlike cuts such as ham, for which overseas buying can help reduce reserves.”

“The best thing that’s happened to the party, and I would say one of the best things Donald Trump ever did, was he put an end to the Clinton dynasty. It was not helping the party, it was trapped in the past.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking on Tucker Carlson Tonight on June 1, 2017.

After all, the president is also struggling in the polls, battling his own party on Syria, and had to reverse himself on hosting the G-7 at his Florida resort.

But no, the Dems are nervous. So nervous, in fact, that they’re engaged in their quadrennial ritual of fantasizing.

MICK MULVANEY STRUGGLES AS WHITE HOUSE LEAKS SAY HIS JOB IS IN JEOPARDY

What superhero is ready to don a cape, swoop in to rescue them and capture the White House?

The media love such fantasies, of course, because it’s an exciting story line and the chance to pump up a new personality.

Remember when Oprah made a few comments and the press was seized by the idea that she could be president? The only problem was, well, she didn’t want to be president.

Now comes a New York Times report that Democratic donors and insiders are “fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute.”

The reason, obviously, is a lack of confidence that any of the current field can defeat Donald Trump—who, even after a likely impeachment vote, is virtually certain to survive a trial in the Republican Senate.

The current polls show several Democratic candidates besting Trump, but that could look very different in the fall of 2020 after the nominee is battered by zillions in Republican advertising along with Trumpian attacks.

Joe Biden probably has the best chance to oust Trump, but there is rising concern that his uneven debate performances and anemic fundraising may sink his primary campaign. Biden could have dominated as the target of Trump’s Ukraine efforts, in my view, but he has still not done an interview since impeachment exploded.

Elizabeth Warren is viewed by the prognosticators as having the best shot at the nomination, but there is growing fear that she’s too far left to win a general election. Even as she’s taking a second look at Medicare for All, having ducked questions that it would force a middle-class tax hike, Warren is saddled with other positions that delight Democrats but could be viewed as socialistic in a general election.

If you assume that Bernie Sanders can’t win as a 78-year-old heart attack survivor, that leaves two moderate alternatives to Biden.

Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both had strong debate outings last week, and Mayor Pete has surged into third place in the latest Iowa poll. But neither seems a surefire bet to beat Trump. And thanks to Nancy Pelosi, both are getting far less media oxygen because of the overwhelming focus on impeachment.

So who do the Democratic dreamers want?

The Times says Sherrod Brown is getting a lot of calls (his wife confirms this). But if the Ohio senator thought he could win the nomination, he would already be in the race.

Eric Holder is toying with the idea of getting in. But Barack Obama’s attorney general has never won an election.

Mike Bloomberg? He was a very good New York mayor, but he threatens to run every four years and never does. He wound up deferring to Biden this time. He’s 77. Not happening.

Hillary? You know she’s thought about it. But she also knows she’s had her shot.

(Update: Oops! The Washington Post follows up today, saying: ""Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction."")

Michelle Obama? I’m sure she’d look good in Democratic polls. One unnamed person “mused” about her to the Times. She was a popular first lady. But unlike Hillary, Michelle has never exhibited the urge to be a politician herself. I have the sense that she devoted eight years to public service and is happy to have her life back.

Late entries can kick up a fuss, but they never win, not after the current candidates have raised millions, set up organizations and developed their ground games.

So this is really about a collective unease that Biden won’t win the nomination and that Warren might.

It’s like a fantasy football league, lots of fun to play and game out the possibilities. But this is a contest you only win with flesh-and-blood players on the field."

HILLARY CLINTON BACKS OUT OF DC EVENT ALSO SET TO INCLUDE TULSI GABBARD, KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: REPORT

The story -- titled “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’” -- said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against President Trump, citing Biden’s lackluster debate performance in Ohio last week.

They also raised concerns about the former vice president's fundraising struggles and his need to defend his family’s business dealings in Ukraine amid the ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry.

They also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont were likely too liberal to win the general election.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported that Clinton was considering a 2020 rematch against Trump after the State Department concluded this week there was ""no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information"" regarding Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.

Host Ainsley Earhardt said people like retired Navy Adm. William McRaven and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, are being urged to run due to the ""weakness"" in the field. Other Democrats have urged former first lady Michelle Obama to run, though she said over the summer there is ""zero chance"" she will do so.

Kilmeade said traditional Democrats are concerned that proposing free health care for illegal immigrants, potentially taking away private insurance in favor of a ""Medicare-for-all system"" and imposing a Green New Deal on the energy industry will not appeal to voters in the middle.

""They're saying, 'You want to give a Green New Deal that would destroy the energy industry? You want to give free health care to illegal immigrants? What planet are you on that you want to take down ObamaCare?' ... That's what everyone is saying on these stages,"" he said.

Bill Weld, a 2020 Republican presidential candidate, called President Trump ""completely unacceptable"" and rejected his claim GOP lawmakers who don't support him are ""human scum.""

Weld, who was 2016 Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson's running mate, told Neil Cavuto Wednesday on ""Your World"" he is also seeing electoral headway in New Hampshire ahead of that state's 2020 primary.

""I think the president is too out of control for this country,"" he said.

""Things are moving in New Hampshire. I came up 28 points against the president in a head-to-head in the last 30 days... The president doesn't help himself when he goes three-for-three on making America look like an unreliable ally.""

BILL WELD 'THRILLED' OTHER REPUBLICANS ARE CHALLENGING TRUMP IN PRIMARY

In that regard, Weld claimed Trump has weakened America's standing in the world through his treatment of the Kurds in the Middle East, Ukraine, and most recently Iran.

Weld claimed the president is ""begging"" to get back to the negotiating table with Tehran.

He later laughed heartily when Cavuto asked about the president's recent tweets -- one of which claimed Republicans who don't support him are ""human scum,"" and another that labeled frequent critic Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a ""pompous ass.""

""I think that he just is so unreliable and just can't stick to a story, and particularly not a true story,"" he said.

Regarding his primary battle with Trump, Weld said he is honing in on both New Hampshire and Super Tuesday states.

He rejected the claim his candidacy could be seen as hurting the Republican Party.

""They say everyone's got to be loyal and rally around the flag [but] too often, particularly in Washington, D.C., loyalty is nothing but an excuse for doing the wrong thing,"" he said.

He called progressive Democratic presidential hopefuls Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ""not currently electable in the United States,"" but added Trump's reelection would be ""perhaps a bigger risk than those two Democrats -- who would not be able to get anything through Congress.""

During the interview, Weld and Cavuto also discussed whether his focus on New Hampshire has parallels to then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy's, D-Minn., surprise primary performance there in 1968 -- which lead incumbent President Lyndon Johnson to later drop out of the race. The 1968 Democratic nomination eventually went to Johnson's vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey.

""I'm looking for 50 percent, not 40 percent. Pat Buchanan got 37, Gene McCarthy got 41 and they knocked people out of the race, but I have in mind Super Tuesday,"" Weld said."

Yang also called the push to eliminate private insurance by rivals Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as part of their ""Medicare-for-all"" plans, “too disruptive.”

And the tech entrepreneur and 2020 longshot, who has seen his campaign soar in recent months, said that if he doesn’t win the Democratic nomination, he’d “be open to” serving as running mate.

CLINTON-GABBARD CLASH RAISES ROLE ABOUT 2016 NOMINEE'S ROLE IN 2020 RACE

Yang made his comments while taking questions from reporters Tuesday evening in Hollis, N.H., and Wednesday morning after headlining ‘Politics and Eggs,’ a must stop for White House hopefuls campaigning in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state.

His swing through the Granite State comes days after Clinton firmly inserted herself into the 2020 campaign – arguing without evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a “Russian asset,” and mocking President Trump’s direct interactions with foreign leaders.

Gabbard, in a blistering video released over the weekend, suggested that Clinton had “smeared” her as payback for the Hawaii congresswoman’s endorsement of Sanders in the marathon 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle.

The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee has remained in the spotlight after winning the 2016 national popular vote but losing the election and the White House to Trump. And she’s served as a longtime foil for Republicans.

But her comments and actions in recent days have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level – renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has ambitions to mount a third bid for president.

Yang said that “nominees of the party from past cycles remain very important figures in the party, in that Hillary would have a lot of value to add.”

But he then emphasized that “she's not a candidate and it strikes me as a little bit inappropriate for her to be commenting directly about candidates since we're all Democrats. And you think that she’d be neutral unless she decided to endorse a particular candidate.”

WARREN SAYS SHE'LL SOON RELEASE PLAN ON HOW TO PAY FOR HER MEDICARE FOR ALL PROPOSAL

On health care, Yang announced that “we’re going to release a detailed health care plan in the days ahead.”

And specifically on the ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal introduced in the Senate by Sanders and backed by Warren, Yang said: “I support the spirit of what Bernie is trying to accomplish. I do think that outlawing private insurance in a very short period of time is a bit too disruptive, and I would not do it.”

He reiterated that “I've been on the record for a long time saying that there would be a role for some private insurers in my plan. I think most private insurers will disappear if we do a good enough job with the public plan, but that there would be some companies that genuinely do add value and adapt to the new circumstances.”

As Yang arrived in New Hampshire, his staff in the state was in the process of expanding. Yang’s team in the crucial early-voting state stood at around 15 at the beginning of the month, but a senior adviser told Fox News they planned to add at least 10 new hires by the end of October or early November.

Yang’s campaign has been fueled by his unconventional style and his push for what he calls the ‘Freedom Dividend,’ a universal basic income system that would pay all adult Americans $1,000 per month. The plan would help Americans cope with the loss of jobs due to the increased impact of automation and artificial intelligence.

Asked if he’d be open to serving as the Democratic Party’s running mate if he fails to win the nomination, Yang told Fox News “my goal is to solve the problems of the 21st century. I believe the best way I can do that is as president. But if it's in some other capacity, I'd be open to that. The goal is really just to make sure that this country is in a condition that I'm proud to pass along to my kids.”

Yang, along with many other of the Democratic presidential candidates, has disavowed outside super PACs as he pledges to combat the influence of dark money in politics. But a new group – called the Math PAC – has vowed to raise and spend at least $1 million in support of Yang’s campaign.

Yang told Fox News and CBS News that “I know very little about the Math PAC, genuinely.”

“I'm not going to try and dissuade them, because we have the rules that we have. After I'm president, I'm very happy to repeal Citizens United and try and do away with super PACs entirely. But given the rules that we have right now, my goal is to compete and to win and so I'm not going to dissuade private citizens from trying to help,” he added.

Yang’s come a long way since the early days of his campaign, when the outsider and first-time candidate was the longest of long shots. He said he now feels like he’s being taken seriously by the Democratic establishment

“I've been thrilled by the momentum that the campaign has gotten; certainly we might have started as something of a newcomer/outsider, but I feel like I'm becoming more and more part of the establishment, as we get more support,” he noted.

But there continue to be moments when the candidate – who’s qualified for all of the presidential primary debates to date – is snubbed by the mainstream media.

His supporters, known as the Yang Gang, have started a trending hashtag on Twitter dubbing what they are calling unfair coverage of the candidate a #YangMediaBlackout. The latest example they cite is The Weather Channel, which did not invite Yang to participate in their climate change special set to air Nov. 7.

“Another mystery, given that by any objective standard, I am either fourth, fifth or sixth in this race. And so why would you invite, I believe, nine candidates or ten candidates and not invite Andrew Yang? I do not know. I have a very extensive climate change plan. I like the Weather Channel just as much as the next American,” Yang told Fox News when asked about the lack of an invite."

Quintal made a call at 2:45 a.m. on Thursday to a ""third party"" in Warren and ""asked for help,"" according to the sheriff's office, who said the third party then contacted their office.

""Deputies and Michigan State Police arrived on scene at 2:58 a.m. and observed evidence of possible foul play but were unable to locate Adrienne,"" police wrote on Facebook.

Quintal's son, Nick White, told FOX2 on Monday that his mother went up north with her boyfriend to the family cabin, but the boyfriend returned to their home in Southfield, Mich. on Tuesday, Oct. 15, two days before Quintal was reported missing.

""He was up there with her, he came home to drop supplies off, we are working on the condo here,"" White said.

Quintal was at the cabin to do some work on it, according to White.

""She was also just getting ready for hunting and hanging out and enjoying the wildlife,"" he told FOX2.

The sheriff's office said the 47-year-old's purse, phone and car remained on the property.

Investigators attempted to track Quintal's movements with a K-9 team but were unable to find her. White told FOX2 that police were out with a dog searching all of Thursday morning before a search party made another attempt later to find his mother.

Over the weekend, local and state police joined the Benzie-Manistee Community Emergency Response Team with a group of about 20 people, but the searchers again came up empty.

CERT public information officer Glenn Zaring told WWTV the group was out until 4:30 p.m. on Saturday doing sweeps of areas after using a computer program to help them track the probabilities of where someone may be located.

“We were actually searching almost like the back swampy area from Little Platte Lake up into some very thick hunting woods along Indian Hill Road,” Zaring told the television station.

Officials are expected to be out Tuesday morning with a drone in another attempt to find Quintal, according to WWTV.

Trump flaunted his actions to bolster the oil and gas industries in the country – including approving some controversial pipelines, pulling out of Paris Climate Accord and abandoning former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan – while slamming Democrats for putting the fossil fuel industry ""under assault,"" as he put it.

""Our natural resources don’t belong to the government, they belong to the people,"" Trump said during the speech at the Shale Insight Conference. ""We've ended the war on American energy and we’ve ended the assault on American energy workers.""

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES TOWARD NATIONAL FUEL ECONOMY STANDARD, PREPARES FOR LEGAL BATTLE WITH CALIFORNIA

The president’s speech, in front of an audience comprised heavily of blue-collar workers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, marked the second time in three months he has traveled to the Keystone State. Pennsylvania, which Trump narrowly won in 2016, would be a crucial state to win in the next presidential election; Trump apparently has seen his pro-industry policies as a path toward winning it, and his reelection, once again.

The president railed against a ban on fracking – which had the support of many Democrats seeking to unseat him in 2020 – arguing that the controversial method of extracting natural gas brought wealth to rural and downtrodden areas and will create a boom in construction jobs throughout the state.

""My job is to represent to people of Pittsburgh, not the people of Paris,"" Trump said, resurfacing a line he used previously.

The politics surrounding the oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania, however, has not been as clean as Trump said the pipelines will be.

In the suburbs that might be key to his path to victory, Pennsylvania voters have shown a growing opposition to the drilling and massive pipelines required to move its product across the state. Candidates in state and local races increasingly have been hardening their stances on the industry. National polling showed growing skepticism of fracking, the process used in extraction.

While the issue is unlikely to have a game-changing effect on the race already dominated by Trump's strong personality, a looming impeachment fight and accusations of racism, Trump's eagerness to promote the industry underscored his tight focus on shoring up his base of rural voters, even at the risk of alienating others.

""Today, I'm proud to declare that I've delivered on every single promise I made to this conference three years ago and much, much more,"" Trump said.

Several Democrats seeking the White House have taken their own political risks on the issue. Backed by environmentalists on the left, soe candidates— including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — have broken from the party's past support for fracking to call for a nationwide ban. More centrist candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have declined to go that far.

Biden, who also was in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, openly criticized Trump, saying the policies he espoused hurt those very same blue-collar workers the president was courting later in the day.

Biden cast the wealthy president as a charlatan populist whose tax policies, economic stewardship and overall erratic leadership style has hurt U.S. workers.

""This administration has no idea what hard-working, decent, ordinary Americans are going through,"" Biden said during a speech in his hometown of Scranton.

Biden has argued that he could reassemble Obama's winning coalition by winning back some working-class white voters who sided with Trump while reversing Democrats' decline from 2012 among nonwhite voters in cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee.

DEM ELITES SEARCHING FOR WHITE KNIGHT

NYT: “When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race — but could be lured in. Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. It’s that time of the election season for Democrats. ‘Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I’ve had five or six people ask me: ‘Is there anybody else?’ said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party’s recent conventions.”

Warren ups the ante another $800 billion - WSJ: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $800 billion in additional federal funding for public education, a move that would exhaust the remaining revenue to be raised by her proposed wealth tax even as she seeks ways to finance Medicare for All. Ms. Warren outlined on the blog site Medium an additional $450 billion in Title I funding to boost schools with low-income students, $200 billion in grants for students with disabilities and $100 billion in other grants over 10 years. She also vowed to invest $50 billion in school infrastructure on top of existing funding for school upgrades that are in some of her other policy proposals.”



Castro promises to quit if he can’t raise $800,000 in 10 days - Politico: “Julián Castro on Monday threatened to suspend his presidential bid unless he can raise nearly $1 million by the end of the month. ‘If I can’t raise $800,000 in the next 10 days — I will have no choice but to end my race for president,’ Castro wrote in a fundraising email to supporters. ‘If I don’t meet this deadline, I won’t have the resources to keep my campaign running.’ The strategy is nearly identical to Cory Booker’s ‘radical transparency’ gambit last month, when his campaign warned in a memo to supporters that the New Jersey senator would end his White House bid if he was unable to raise $1.7 million in the final 10 days of September.”



Buttigieg’s sexuality a hurdle with black voters - The [Columbia, S.C.] State: “Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a key reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: many see his sexuality as a problem. The 21-page report, conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group with black Democratic South Carolina voters in mid-July and obtained exclusively by McClatchy, found that ‘being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed deeply uncomfortable even discussing it. … [T]heir preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center. While the report stated that Buttigieg’s sexuality was not a ‘disqualifier’ for these voters, some of the focus group participants questioned why Buttigieg even brought it up.’



Facebook ramps up election security efforts ahead of 2020 - AP: “With just over a year left until the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Facebook is stepping up its efforts to ensure it is not used as a tool to interfere in politics and democracies around the world. The efforts include a special security tool for elected officials and candidates that monitors them for hacking attempts. Facebook said Monday it will also label state-controlled media as such, label fact-checks more clearly and invest $2 million in media literacy projects. The company says it will add more prominent labels on debunked posts on Facebook as well as on Instagram. It will put labels on top of what are deemed ‘false’ and ‘partly false’ photos and videos.”



THE RULEBOOK: OF NOTE

“Every candid reader will make the proper reflections on these important facts.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 38



TIME OUT: ‘EVERYONE’S GOT THEIR THING’

NYT: “The pressures of sexual selection have made peacocks gorgeous, wood thrushes sonorous and birds of paradise great dancers. At first glance, the white bellbird doesn’t appear to have benefited similarly. Barrel-chested and big-mouthed, with a long wattle dangling from the top of its beak, this rainforest bird looks more like a Muppet than an avian Casanova. But everyone’s got their thing. According to a paper published Monday in Current Biology, this goofball boasts the loudest birdsong ever recorded. And he must be proud of it, because he sings the most piercing note right into potential mates’ faces. The white bellbird — one of four bellbird species in South and Central America — is a favorite among birders in Brazil. It has a ‘strange, metallic, kind of alien call,’ said Caio Brito, one of the founders of Brazil Birding Experts. When several sing at once, they are ‘deafening,’ and sound like ‘several blacksmiths trying to compete,’ said Arthur Gomes, a biology student at São Paulo State University who contributed to the new research.”

IMPEACHMENT TIMING GETS TRICKIER FOR HOUSE DEMS

NYT: “House Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings against President Trump will extend into the Christmas season, as they plan a series of public hearings intended to make the simplest and most devastating possible public case in favor of removing Mr. Trump. Democratic leaders had hoped to move as soon as Thanksgiving to wrap up a narrow inquiry focused around Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, buoyed by polling data that shows that the public supports the investigation, even if voters are not yet sold on impeaching the president. But after a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale — and probably more time-consuming — effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill.”



Diplomat who raised red flag on Giuliani-Trump deal testifies today - Reuters: “William Taylor, a former Army officer and career U.S. diplomat now leading the U.S. embassy in Kiev, will be the latest in a series of current and former officials to meet behind closed doors with the Democratic-led House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees in the month since the probe began. Committee members and staff are examining whether the Republican Trump abused his office by improperly putting pressure on Ukraine to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival and leading candidate for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination. Taylor’s testimony is of particular interest to investigators because of his leading role at the embassy in Ukraine. He raised concern about military assistance being withheld from Kiev to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.”



Schiff un-censured - Fox News: “The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted Monday evening to table, or set aside, a resolution to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The vote was 218 to 185 to table the resolution, which the Republican minority had introduced. All Democrats voted to table the censure resolution, with all Republicans voting against tabling. Independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party earlier this year, voted to table the resolution.”



President Trump draws ire of black lawmakers for ‘lynching’ claim - AP: “President Donald Trump enraged Democrats on Tuesday by comparing their impeachment inquiry to a lynching, assigning the horrors of a deadly and racist chapter in U.S. history to a process laid out in the Constitution. ‘That is one word no president ought to apply to himself,’ said Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African American in Congress. ‘That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using’ he said. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., called on Trump to delete the tweet.”



MICK MULVANEY: KICKING GAFFES AND TAKING NAMES

Reuters: “U.S. President Donald Trump has been fielding suggestions from allies on who might succeed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, amid frustration at his team’s response to the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, two sources close to the White House said on Monday. Trump’s irritation at being dogged by a variety of issues - from impeachment to his decision to move U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria - was on display on Monday in the White House Cabinet Room as the president aired his grievances at length before his senior advisers and a group of reporters. The president has been focused in part on Mulvaney’s comments to reporters last week that Trump had withheld military aid from Ukraine in an effort to get Kiev to investigate a debunked claim about the 2016 U.S. election.”



Cuccinelli blocked from DHS job - AP: “President Donald Trump has been notified by his staff that he can’t select two popular figures — Ken Cuccinelli and Mark Morgan — to serve as an acting secretary of homeland security because a federal law governing agency succession makes them ineligible. Instead, Sean Doocey, the White House director of presidential personnel, in recent days gave Trump a list of other officials to consider as acting secretary, including top DHS official Chad Wolf and Transportation Security Administration chief David Pekoske, according to three people familiar with the conversation. The news has infuriated immigration hawks inside and outside the administration who had been lobbying for Cuccinelli to fill the role and now fear Trump will tap Wolf, a former chief of staff to ousted DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen who once worked as a lobbyist on employment visas.”



TRUMP LOOKS SOUTH FOR A BOOST

Politico: “Donald Trump is going all-in on a trio of Southern governor’s races in November, gambling that a clean sweep will help him regain his political footing at the most perilous moment of his presidency. Trump is expected to barnstorm Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana over the next few weeks, while dispatching prominent supporters to help in each contest. And Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through eastern Kentucky, a pivotal area on the state’s political map that could decide the fate of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. Trump badly needs a boost right now, and the White House sees the elections in the conservative states as the best near-term hope of achieving it.”



Impeachment adds windage to Kentucky contest - WSJ: “The gubernatorial election in Kentucky next month hinges in large part on whether voters are motivated by bread-and-butter issues close to home or national politics supercharged by the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. It is one of three governor’s races this year, along with those in Louisiana and Mississippi, that can offer insights on the electorate’s mood ahead of the 2020 presidential election.”

[Ed. note: You will be so glad you did! “Opinions are luxury items” is a close cousin to one of my dad’s favorites: “You can be happy or you can be right, but not usually both.” In our relationships it matters so much more that we listen and really hear each other. The simple but always challenging act of loving our neighbors starts by talking with them, which can’t happen if we’re talking at them. This not only makes us happier people and better friends, spouses and parents it also lets us save our strongest defenses for the things that matter the most.]

PICTURE DAY IS THE WURST

WSVN: “A 4th grader had a unique outfit for his school photo. Craig Arsenault posted a photo of his son Jake’s school ID. For his school photo, Jake dressed up in a hot dog costume. ‘My wife and I dared our son to wear a hot dog costume for school pictures. The school let him do it, and I couldn’t be happier,’ Arsenault said. According to Fox 13, Arsenault said the family had the costume “laying around for (the) last year,” and the idea came up when Jake voiced his wonder about what to wear for his school photo. ‘My wife suggested the hot dog costume. He was hesitant, so we bet him 10 bucks he wouldn’t do it,’ the father said. However, Jake accepted the dare and donned the costume for his photo. … Arsenault said he only had $7 at the time, which he gave to his son, but his son is holding him to the other $3.”

The pl… [+4268 chars]",The GOP plan comes after Republicans were unable to agree on an option to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act while they held both the House and the Senate during the first two years of President Trump's administration.,2019-10-22,Fox News,House Republicans release plan in bid to fulfill Trump promise as 'party of health care',https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-release-healthcare-plan-in-effort-to-fulfill-trump-promise-as-the-party-of-healthcare,"The Republican Study Committee released a healthcare plan Tuesday to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, two years after the GOP was unable to agree on a health care plan during the first year of President Trump's administration.

The plan also represents an effort to compete with Democrats' messaging on ""Medicare-for-All"" and other health care plans as the 2020 Democratic primary campaign hits its stride.

The 66-page framework seeks to ""transform the individual marketplace's current regulatory structure, unwind the ACA's Washington-centric approach and largely return regulatory authority to individual states.""

This includes provisions to increase the portability of health insurance within the individual marketplace, provide federal funding for state-designed ""guaranteed coverage pools"" which would help cover individuals with pre-existing conditions -- though it does not require states to run such pools -- put a moratorium on Medicaid expansions so it can be ""sustainable ... for generations to come"" and promotes ""innovative care"" such as telemedicine.

""It is a plan that: PROTECTS the vulnerable,"" a statement attached to the plan says, ""especially those with pre-existing conditions; EMPOWERS individuals with greater control over their health care choices and dollars; and PERSONALIZES health care to meet individual needs and reduce premiums, deductibles, and the overall cost of health care.""

2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SAYS ELIZABETH WARREN IS LYING ABOUT HER HEALTHCARE PLAN: 'IT'S A SOUNDBITE'

Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., Rep. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. Rep. Larry Buchshon, R-Ind., Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., Rep John Joyce, R-Pa., Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C. and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas all signed the document.

The health care portability provision, specifically, would extend similar protections to those moving from individual plan to individual plan as currently exist for those between employer-sponsored insurance plans. This, the framework's authors say, would prevent patients from being denied coverage while moving between individual plans, for example, while moving to a different state.

The RSC's document, which is not a bill but rather a list of ideas the RSC says will be hashed out through debate, also includes increased limits on health savings accounts. The RSC proposes uncoupling health savings accounts from high-deductible plans and raising the cap on such accounts to $9,000 for individuals and $18,000 for families, more than double what is allowed under current law.

The RSC framework does add one caveat to the use of health savings accounts, however.

SANDERS ACCUSES BIDEN OF PUSHING INSURANCE INDUSTRY 'TALKING POINTS' BY SLAMMING 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

""Critically, while the RSC plan would unleash health savings accounts, it would ensure that these accounts are pro-life and do not inadvertently allow a back-door method of subsidizing abortion procedures,"" the plan reads. ""Accordingly, the RSC plan would ensure these accounts cannot be linked to a plan that provides abortions, nor would abortions or abortion drugs be an eligible expense.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the RSC's ideas, criticizing Republicans for not bringing Democrats into the fold on their plans to replace the Affordable Care Act.

""After 10 years of refusing to work with Democrats to #ProtectOurCare, the only plans offered by Republicans don’t cover & protect preexisting conditions,"" she tweeted Tuesday. ""They say their plan is an alternative to the Affordable Care Act but it’s really just an alternative to health care, period.""

The conservative organization Freedomworks, on the other hand, released a statement in support of the RSC's proposal, saying it would improve health care for consumers while also sticking to small-government principles.

“We’re thrilled to see a coalition in Congress with a health care plan that is based around individual choice and ownership of health insurance,"" Jason Pye, FreedomWorks Vice President of Legislative Affairs, said. ""The RSC plan also respects federalism by allowing states to decide how best to extend affordable coverage for their residents.

“From the large expansion of health savings accounts to the elimination of many provisions of current law that have made health insurance coverage so unaffordable, Americans across the country will benefit from the choice afforded to them by this plan."""

On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that the average premium for the Affordable Care Act benchmark plan would drop by 4 percent in 2020, with 20 more insurance plans becoming available on healthcare.gov.

HOUSE GOP RELEASE PLAN IN BID TO FULFILL TRUMP PROMISE AS 'PARTY OF HEALTH CARE'

CMS Administrator Seema Varna also testified on Capitol Hill Wednesday, during a House Energy & Commerce hearing titled: “Sabotage: The Trump administration’s attack on health care,” that in some states, premiums are dropping even more significantly.

In Delaware, premiums dropped 20 percent; in North Dakota premiums dropped 15 percent; and in Oklahoma, dropped 14 percent. Three states, though, -- Indiana, Louisiana, and New Jersey -- will see premiums increase 10 percent or more.

The Trump campaign told Fox News that those figures are a result of action taken by the administration over the last few years to make the Affordable Care Act more competitive, deliver more free-market principles, give consumers more options, and improve the ObamaCare marketplace.

“While Democrats continue to push the narrative that President Trump is trying to ‘sabotage’ their health care, the latest data confirm exactly the opposite,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News.

Democrats on the Energy & Commerce Committee on Wednesday, though, blasted the administration, claiming it was engaging in a ""concerted effort to cut back on people's health insurance, their benefits, and what kind of coverage they have.""

Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said the administration is actively supporting a lawsuit that would overturn the Affordable Care Act and strip health care coverage from tens of millions of Americans and place ""extremely burdensome and sometimes illegal hurdles"" for Medicaid recipients.

""I am deeply concerned,"" he said.

2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SAYS WARREN IS LYING ABOUT HEALTH CARE PLAN: 'IT'S A SOUNDBITE'

Earlier this year, the administration told a federal appeals court that the program in its entirety should be abolished. Democrats criticized the administration and Republicans for trying to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

But the White House has touted a number of improvements under the ACA since Trump took office--including the administration's ability to ""make it easier for small businesses and self-employed workers"" to join and create Association Health Plans; the expansion of short-term, limited-duration plans that typically cost less than other ObamaCare options; the expansion of health reimbursement arrangements; and the elimination of the individual mandate, which forced Americans to buy health insurance, whether they wanted to or not.

This month, Trump signed an executive order that “directed HHS to take a number of specific, significant steps that will meaningfully improve the financing of Medicare, advance the care American seniors receive from their doctors, and improve the health they enjoy.""

But even as the Trump re-election campaign and Trump administration takes credit for the Affordable Care Act’s current stability, officials and Republican lawmakers are still pursuing Trump’s 2016 campaign promise of trying to do away with the program altogether.

This week, the Republican Study Committee released a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, two years after the GOP was unable to agree on a health care plan to scrap ObamaCare during the first year of Trump’s administration.

The new 66-page framework also represents an effort to compete with 2020 Democrats pushing health care plans like ""Medicare-for-all."" The new plan looks to “transform the individual marketplace’s current regulatory structure, unwind the ACA’s Washington-centric approach and largely return regulatory authority to individual states.”

""Until Congress gets around to replacing it, the president will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans,"" HHS Secretary Alexander Azar said. ""The president who was supposedly trying to sabotage this law has been better at running it than the guy who wrote it.""

As for 2020, Democratic presidential hopefuls like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have blasted Trump for his handling of the health care system, and are peddling a sweeping ""Medicare-for-all"" policy.

Candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden have instead touted ObamaCare, and proposed building on the Obama-era health care overhaul, while criticizing Trump for his moves to eliminate it.

“Before Donald Trump even stepped foot into the Oval Office, he pledged to strip millions of Americans of their health care,"" Biden said in a statement released by his campaign earlier this month. “As Donald Trump continues attempting to tear down the Affordable Care Act, I will fight him every step of the way.”

Meanwhile, with regard to the lawsuit, a federal appeals court in New Orleans could deliver its ruling on the case during the sign-up season--spanning from Nov. 1 in most states through Dec. 15.

Azar said that he was not concerned, even if the judges rule to throw out the entire health care program.

""Our messaging would be to keep calm and carry on,"" he said, noting that the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court. ""There will be no immediate disruption to anyone.""

In addition, he noted that Gabbard, D-Hawaii, supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in 2016.

""You have these people who, they've run for president...they lose, they're bitter, they're resentful,"" Zeldin told Hemmer.

BIDEN AND WARREN CAMPAIGNS SILENT OVER CLINTON ATTACK ON GABBARD: TOMI LAHREN THINKS SHE KNOWS WHY

""You see it on the Democratic side with Hillary Clinton — and now she's going after Tulsi Gabbard calling her a 'Russian asset,'"" he said.

Appearing on former President Obama aide David Plouffe's ""Campaign HQ"" podcast last week, Clinton accused Gabbard – although not referring to her by name – of being a ""Russian asset"" and a ""third-party candidate.""

“I'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

Gabbard lashed out at Clinton on Twitter Friday, calling her the ""queen of warmongers [and the] embodiment of corruption"" in response to the allegations.

She also told Fox News' Tucker Carlson on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" last week that Clinton is waging a smear campaign against her because ""she knows she can't control me."" She accused Clinton of having ""blood on her hands"" after the Iraq War she ""championed.""

""Their blood is on her hands. That's why she's smearing my character and trying to undermine my campaign,"" Gabbard said.

In an exclusive interview Monday on “Hannity,” President Trump blasted his former opponent.

""I said, wait a minute, it took me two-and-a-half years, I wish she would have said that earlier because people... have realized she is crazy,"" he told Hannity. ""She’s crazy.”

Some Democrats have made similar claims about Gabbard, but other prominent leaders have slammed Clinton.

""Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,"" wrote Sanders. ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.""

""[Hillary is] not dealing with her loss well,"" said Zeldin. ""She believes that ... the legacy of why she lost is due to – in her mind – the Russians changing the outcome of our election. I think she's convinced herself of it.""

""She has this bitterness towards Russia because of it and she's gotten to the point where she also blames Tulsi Gabbard,"" he concluded.

Team officials completed the deal Monday, less than two hours before an NBA deadline would have allowed players with rookie contracts to become restricted free agents next summer.

The Pacers did not announce financial terms of the deal though ESPN.com first reported it was worth $77 million in guaranteed money and Sabonis could make as much as $85 million with bonuses.

A message was left by The Associated Press with Sabonis' agent, Greg Lawrence.

""I'm very excited to remain with the Pacers, this is where I wanted to be,"" Sabonis said in a statement. ""I appreciate the organization showing their confidence in me, and I'm ready to be part of what's going to be a great year for our team.""

It's dramatic turnabout from last weekend when reports surfaced Sabonis soon could be on the trading block.

But now the Pacers have four of this season's projected starters under contract through at least 2021-22.

Center Myles Turner, last season's NBA blocks champion, signed his four-year extension worth $72 million last October. Point guard Malcolm Brogdon was acquired in a sign-and-trade from Milwaukee this summer after agreeing to terms on a four-year deal worth $85 million. Small forward T.J. Warren also was acquired in at trade this summer, from Phoenix, and still has three years remaining on what was originally a four-year deal worth $47 million.

The contract of two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo, expires after next season.

Oladipo is still recovering from a torn quad tendon in his right knee, which forced him to miss the final three months last season. He's recently ramped up his activity during practices but is not expected to see any game action until at least December.

But in the midst of a major offseason overhaul, the Pacers became convinced that putting Sabonis at power forward and using a more traditional lineup with two big men on the floor could work.

So Monday, Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard made it clear this was not just an experiment. Instead, he made a hefty investment to give the lineup a chance to work.

""We love the toughness that Domantas brings to our team, and we can't wait to see him play in his expanded role this year,"" Pritchard said. ""He's had so much growth in his career and we're excited for what that means for his future, as well as the future of our team.""

Sabonis started 66 games as a rookie in Oklahoma City before he being traded to Indiana, with Oladipo, in a swap for Paul George.

With Indiana, Sabonis has made steady progress.

He averaged 11.6 points and 7.7 rebounds in his first season with the Pacers — a significant improvement over his rookie season in 2016-17. And last season he finished as the runner-up for the NBA's Sixth Man Award after averaging 14.1 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 0.6 blocks — all career highs."

Bob Paulson: The Mountie

Chuck Rosenberg: Welcome to The Oath. I’m Chuck Rosenberg, and I am honored to be your host for another thoughtful conversation with a fascinating guest. Bob Paulson, our very first international guest on the Oath, served as the twenty third commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The iconic Mounties are the Federal Police Force of Canada, but they have a broad mandate also to enforce municipal and provincial law in Canada. After a stint as an officer and a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force, where he learned hard and humbling lessons about leadership. Bob worked his way up through the RCMP, starting as a constable in a small British Columbia town where he fell in love with policing. A thoughtful, progressive and inspirational leader with a keen sense of humor, Bob Paulson explains the history of the Mounties, his own successes and failures as he rose through its ranks to lead the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lessons learned during an extraordinary career in law enforcement. Bob Paulson, welcome to The Oath.

Bob Paulson: Well, thank you. Thanks for having me, Chuck.

Rosenberg: You know, you are our first international guest. We are here in Ottawa, your nation’s capital, beautiful city, and it’s awfully nice of you to sit down with us.

Paulson: Well, I’m honored that you asked.

Rosenberg: Many of our listeners are from Canada and other countries around the world. But most of our listeners are American. And so, they may not know much about the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or that you were its former commissioner. And I was going to ask you a bunch of questions about it and about you.

Paulson: Sure. Yeah.

Rosenberg: So, tell us about you.

Paulson: Me? Well, I’m retired two years from the RCMP, but I was a career RCMP officer. I started out as a constable at the lowest rank in British Columbia in 1986.

Rosenberg: Is that where you grew up?

Paulson: No, actually, I grew up in a place called Lachute, which is near Montreal, so in Quebec.

Rosenberg: Long before you joined the RCMP as a constable, you served in the Royal Canadian Air Force.

Paulson: Yeah, I was a pilot. I went through 1977. I entered through the officer Canada training plan and got my wings and stayed in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, which is in the center of the country as an instructor pilot and I was fairly young

Rosenberg: Did you like flying?

Paulson: I loved flying. I hadn’t flown before I joined as a pilot. In fact, my first flight was on the airline to basic training.

Rosenberg: The first time you’d ever been a passenger?

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah.

Rosenberg: So, how did you know you wanted to be a pilot, or did you know?

Paulson: Well, it seemed exciting. My brother had joined–my older brother–had joined the military and was a naval officer. When I considered it, I thought being a jet pilot would be cool. And it was, it was very, very exciting. And the flying was great, but that’s where I started getting exposed at that real, sort of, meaningful level to responsibility, professionalism, and leadership. And I had a bad goal in the military.

Rosenberg: You told me that you grew up a lot as a result of serving in the Air Force.

Paulson: My, my time in the Air Force was a significant failure. And it was both a professional failure and a personal failure.

Rosenberg: And it in what way, Bob?

Paulson: So, I got my wings and I qualified as a jet pilot and I was also a jet pilot instructor and I was very young. And I had some responsibility to look after, to bring three or four student pilots along every day, doing their missions, doing their flights with them, critiquing them, helping them learn. But, I also had a responsibility as an officer and in the Canadian Forces. And so, while my pilot skills were very good, my, my officer development skills were lacking. And I didn’t–I didn’t service that part of the arrangement. Consequently, my first assessment that I got in the military from my flight commander, I remember it like it was yesterday, it was a kind of a punch in the face. I remember him looking me in the eye and saying and having written in my assessment, “Lieutenant Paulson displays significant downward flowing loyalty.”

Rosenberg: What did that mean?

Paulson: Well, I wasn’t sure. I knew it wasn’t good. But, I think the lesson that it was, and I came to understand what it was, is that I wasn’t servicing the organizational interest. I wasn’t participating in the mission of the organization. I was consumed with being popular. And consequently, I was hanging out with my students. You know, I was going for cocktails with them and being a friend as opposed to being their supervisor, being their officer. And it was a failure. I got in trouble. Well, an illustration of it is how I ended up getting charged and basically grounded in my flying career. I took a student out to the West Coast on near the end of his training.

Rosenberg: This is a separate matter,

Paulson: A separate matter, but illustrative, I think, of the failure that I’m not focusing on.

Rosenberg: We’re gonna focus on some successes later.

Paulson: Hopefully I have a couple that we can talk about. But, you know, as we talked about earlier, Chuck, I think failure, adversity is a key component to success, ultimately, and without a good understanding of the risks and the stakes, I don’t think you can succeed. In fact, in my case, I’m completely persuaded that had I not failed at such a level in the military, I wouldn’t have succeeded to the level that I did, if we can define my career as a success, ultimately.

Rosenberg: So, back to your story about the student pilot out West.

Paulson: Yeah. So, he had a brother who worked in a control tower and we were taking students out and exposing them to high density flight areas.

Rosenberg: What does that mean?

Paulson: So, a student pilot has to learn how to how to navigate an airplane into a high-density area, into a major metropolitan airport like Vancouver, Vancouver International, very busy airport, one of the busiest in Canada. So, that’s where we had gone. And in and around Vancouver, as in many cities, there’s a number of airports that are around there. This place was called: Pitt Meadows, and the student persuaded me that–I shouldn’t say persuaded me–I mean, the idea was, let’s take the airplane and go do a little impromptu air show over at this airport where my brother is in the control tower.

Rosenberg: Just for fun.

Paulson: Just for fun. Just for ego and just for a zoom, zoom jollies. And it was rife with bad judgment on my part, right. Not only was I the pilot in command of the aircraft, but I had, sort of, a responsibility for this young, want to be officer. So, we go to the airport, we close off the inter runway. We didn’t have radio communications because in those days the military airplanes had UHF radios and civilian aviation VHF radios. So, we beat up the airport, that was the vernacular, we beat it. We zoom bass, forward, and did all sorts of high speed passes. But at the end, I pulled up vertical. I did a series of vertical rolls. And that day, there was about a 6000-foot overcast ceiling. And I rolled off the top as I went vertical. And then, I pulled down towards the ground and I entered cloud at the top of my arm. And then I came around, went off to our mission, and we landed safely, ultimately on Vancouver Island, which is on the on the west coast of Canada. I didn’t know this, but there was a ministry of transport instructor doing check rides for private pilots that day. And, you know, he got the benefit of this impromptu air show by this irresponsible pilot from the Canadian Armed Forces. And he made notes, and he said ultimately, he wouldn’t have been so outraged had I not entered cloud at the top of the arc because I hadn’t considered, I ought to have known, but the pit metal localizer, which is one of the beams that guides aircraft down for landing, is used as a standard terminal arrival rooting for all of the commercial aircraft that would come into Vancouver International.

Rosenberg: And you’re flying acrobatics in there—

Paulson: In cloud–

Rosenberg: In a cloud, on their approach.

Paulson: Yeah, so pretty hard to blame the inspector. And ultimately, he complained to the military. They did a bit of an inquiry. Wasn’t particularly difficult given that he got the tail number of the airplane. And I was charged. I was charged under the National Defense Act.

Rosenberg: What does that mean?

Paulson: Well, the National Defense Act has a Queen’s Regulations and Orders, which is like a code of justice for the military. It’s equivalent to a criminal consequence. So, I was charged with performing aerobatics in a controlled zone. I was charged with failing to maintain the prescribed distance from cloud. And I was charged with the catch all, which is: conduct prejudice to the good order and discipline of the Canadian Armed Forces. And I had a bit of a summary trial. I didn’t defend myself. And as they say in the military, march they guilty son of a gun in. And I did. I marched in and took my lumps. But that was effectively the end of my career in the military. I was grounded, ultimately, and then transferred to a ground position in North Bay on the east side of the country. And so there already a fair bit of shame and embarrassment and shock that I had fallen so significantly, but not so much that I was prepared to leave the military. I thought I could salvage it.

Rosenberg: You still enjoyed it?

Paulson: I enjoyed the flying, but I wasn’t doing any flying. And I found myself being a production officer in an engineering section, which wasn’t what I was qualified to do, or what signed up for. But, ultimately, I met the commander of the squadron there in North Bay and he took pity on me and I started flying T-33s again. T-33s were the first-generation axial flow jet engines that we used as targets for real pilots. But, but I was able to fly a few missions and, and, so I thought I was getting back on track. But this, sort of, adolescent judgement of mine reared its head again, and I had some disagreements with some navigators that were flying with me. You know, one time, I’m flying out of Calgary, we’re going from eastern Canada to the West Coast, we have to stop to get gas because these little jet airplanes don’t go very far. So, I took off out of Calgary, and I got an overheat light, which is significant, a warning in a small airplane. So, I reduced power, and was going to–I declared a bit of an emergency, and came around. I was going to land.

Rosenberg: Back at Calgary?

Paulson: Back in Calgary. Calgary has got one of the longest airports in Canada –it’s got, what, 10,500-foot runway. That’s relevant because the checklist for an overheat required that I burn fuel down to reduce the weight so I could land, and put the brakes on, but I didn’t do that for some reason. I didn’t want to go fly out, and spend a lot of time flying over the mountains waiting for the fuel. And so, I landed and I took it just about every inch of that runway to land

Rosenberg: Because you’re heavy.

Paulson: And the brakes were red hot and the fire people came out and the navigator who couldn’t fly in the back was a little upset. And then, we had this, sort of, diagnose what was wrong. And I talked to the techs back at our home base, and they say: “you know what, maybe a blow by condition, which was this, the seeding of the exhaust pipe,” and didn’t have afterburners, that T-33. But because it gets so hot, it has to expand. And when it expands, its seats, sometimes its tailpipe is loose. So, I went out and I checked that, said: “yeah, yeah, it’s a little looser than normal, so let’s go.” I said to the navigator, “let’s go. We’re gonna go, and we’re gonna fly over the Rockies on reduced power.” He said: “no, no, no, that’s a bad idea. It’s not like we’re in war over here. What’s the urgency?” Get a tech to come up and fix it.

Rosenberg: Take your time, get it right, and then we’ll go.

Paulson: That’s right. I said: “no, no. I’m the pilot in command. Yeah, rank me by rank. But I’m the decision maker for the airplane because I’m the pilot.” So, he strapped in and strapped in and we took off at a reduced power setting, we made it out, but he wasn’t very happy because if the–my reckoning wasn’t correct, you know, he was out to get out and walk, and he didn’t want to do that. So, when we landed, he complained. And of course, he was right. I mean, it was very poor judgment, and it was characteristic of my approach to my responsibilities in those days. I was a, I was an adolescent and a young man’s body. And I was making decisions that had consequences for people’s lives. And I wasn’t executing on that responsibility. And ultimately, the military agreed. And I agreed at the end of my obligatory service. “Maybe you should go out and find something else to do. Mr. Paulson.” “Roger,” I resigned from the military honorably. It was all good. It was just a bad experience.

Rosenberg: But it must have stung.

Paulson: Oh, it stung. Yeah, stung my ego, it, it was embarrassing, it was shocking, personally. Yeah, and as we talked about, you know, there’s a greater consequence to a social harm, right. Plus, the ego that was, you know, I, I was a jet pilot in a military, and now, I’m not. So, I left.

Rosenberg: After leaving the military, and studying in college, you decided to join the RCMP?

Paulson: Yeah. So, I mean, when I was going to university, I was working in a bar a night. I got married when I left the military. And my wife was still in the military out west. So, I was traveling back and forth to Vancouver. And I was working in this bar, which was kind of a ne’er-do-well bar and a bit of a rough and tumble place. And one day, I saw this guy really clean cut, fit, looking, sharp guy, talking to the bartender, who was a female, by the name of Linda, I said: “who is that guy?” “Oh,” she said, “he’s a narc.” I said “a narc?” “Yeah, yeah, a RCMP officer,” and I said, “what do you want?” “He’s just talking to me. He thinks I’m his informant, but he likes to come in and know who’s who and you want to know who you are.” And so, I got thinking about that because I grew up in eastern Canada. So in Canada, there’s ten provinces, three territories. The RCMP polices at every level of policing in all but two provinces. So, in central Canada, Ontario and Quebec, we don’t have a, sort of, uniformed presence there. The RCMP didn’t do local policing and they didn’t do provincial policing. They just simply did federal policing akin to the FBI.

Rosenberg: Right. And so, for our U.S. listeners, that part of the RCMP is mandate, is like what they know of the FBI.

Paulson: Right.

Rosenberg: You are the federal police for Canada. That’s right. Similar to the Australian Federal Police or to the New Zealand police.

Paulson: Exactly. Yeah. But in those eight other provinces where the provincial police–and in about two seventy municipalities where the municipal police, and in the territories where the territorial police.

Rosenberg: And that model is very different than the FBI.

Paulson: In fact, it’s unique in the world. And if, if and when, and we do get it right from time to time, there is tremendous value in having that ability to draw and police from, from a perspective where you have all levels of communities and provinces and the country in your jurisdiction, right. It’s an incredible intelligence and strategic opportunity. So, I had grown up in an area where I didn’t see RCMP. I knew of them. I knew that they were the FBI. But it got me thinking about what this guy was doing. And so, next time he was in, I talked to him, and he was a street crime guy. So, he was kind of dressed casually, but he’d go around, and he’d try to understand who’s who. And that’s obviously one of the places you’d want to inform yourself of, is the ne’er-do-well bar, and who’s showing up, and what’s going on. So, it was interesting and it caused me to go down the local detachment and apply.

Rosenberg: You tell an interesting story about your application process and your interview process. Do you mind sharing that with us?

Paulson: In Canada, we have two official languages: French and English. And fortunately for me, my mother spoke French to me and I can speak French. So, starting off the story, I go to the detachment, I say, “well, I’d like to join.” She said, “Well, we’re only taking—“this is a female officer comes to the counter and says: “we’re only taking bilingual candidates.” I said: “well, I’m bilingual.” And then she says, “oh, I’m sorry, I’m not, so I’ll have to find someone who can call you.” So, I wait by the phone, a French officer calls me, and we have a nice conversation. And before you know it, I’m going through the process. And I get to the interview stage, which is the final stage. I’ve been tested, I’ve been examined, medically, psychologically, all of the tests that go into the process. And it’s looking pretty good. And Ken Pearson is his name, and I’ll remember him ‘till I die. He says to me: “so you’re a military pilot?” “Yeah.” “And you didn’t wash out?” “No, no I was an instructor and I got about 1,500 dollars.” “You mind telling me why you’re not a pilot anymore?” And so, I had perfected in my sort of dealing with my failure syndrome, I had perfected the art of telling a story about why I’m not a military pilot. You know, featured some of the trouble I got in, but not all the trouble.

Rosenberg: So, you had you had a version, but not a full version.

Paulson: Yeah, that’s right. And said: “Well, jeez, Mr. Paulson, I don’t see a problem here. I think we can get you on a troop right away. Are you free to go in January?” This was September. And I said, “yes, I am. That would be exciting. That’s great.” So, we stood up, and shook hands, and he slapped me on the back and out I went. I went home all excited that I was going to have another shot at redemption.

Rosenberg: You’re feeling pretty good.

Paulson: Feeling very good. Told my wife, as she then was, and she was a little skeptical. She said, “well, don’t get your hopes up.” And about a week and a half later, I got a call on my answering machine. And it was Ken Pearson, who was no longer Bob’s buddy. And it sounded more like the cop that he actually was. And he said, “yeah, look, we, we need to have another talk.” And so, I went down to Vancouver and he said, “I’m a little disappointed.” I said: “why?” “Well, did you not think we’d check into your previous employment?” I said: “Well, I thought you would.” He said: “we have no need of liars in the Mounted Police, Mr. Paulson.” I said, “I’m not a liar.” “Well, you didn’t tell me the whole story.” I said: “well, you know, there’s, there’s versions to that.”

Rosenberg: What did you leave out, Bob?

Paulson: I left out, sort of, the, the real reason why I left the military. I left–I had placed it more, as a sort of, I wasn’t compatible with the military, didn’t, sort of, jive with the leadership thing, and the actual specific failures. And there’s probably three or four of them that I can articulate that gave rise to this administrative burden that I placed on the armed forces. I left those out. And of course, those are all recorded, right.

Rosenberg: And they would matter a lot in this application process.

Paulson: Well, they’re looking for people who are going to go and have considerable sway over people’s lives. And it turns on truthfulness and the honor that a person can bring to their duties. I thought I was done for it. So, I gave him the whole story. And then he started shuffling, got a little nervous. He started shuffling his papers and holding his head in his hands and shaking his head. And then he looked me in the eye and he said, “look, Paulson, I don’t know why, but I got to take a chance on you. And if you let me down, I’m gonna come and find you.” You know, every time I tell that story, I get emotional because it was a break. It was the first real break I had in my sort of adult life. And I, you know, to this day, I say, I don’t know that I deserved a break, but he gave me one. And what that said about the organization, to me at the time, was this this is a place where I can where I can be honest with people, right. It was very, very significant.

Rosenberg: It was a real second chance.

Paulson: It was a real chance.

Rosenberg: You know, it’s interesting to me, Bob, on this show, we’ve talked with two retired four-star Navy admirals from the states: Jim Stavridis and Bill McRaven, and both describe in their own careers, and their own lives as junior officers, bad mistakes that they made. And second chances that they received, and how that played out for them when they became more senior officers.

Paulson: Right.

Rosenberg: And that they extended to others the same second chances that they had received when they were younger.

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah. And I’m struck by the relationship between adversity and leaders and how leaders deal with adversity. And failure is, is key to their success, right. Because you can’t go through any enterprise without having some stumbles. They’re not necessarily personal stumbles, but they’re stumbles in all manner of speaking. And, and how you deal with those, and how you help other people deal with those is the key to, to a successful leader.

Rosenberg: Ken Pearson let you in.

Paulson: Ken Pearson, let me. In fact, when I did the change of command ceremony and handed off to Brenda Lucki, who’s now the commissioner of the RCMP.

Rosenberg: She’s succeeded you as the 24th commissioner of the RCMP. You were the twenty third.

Paulson: Indeed. Yeah, that’s right. I talked about Ken–I don’t know if he’s still around—I, I should go and look him up and buy him a beer, but I owe him a lot.

Rosenberg: How did you like being a cop?

Paulson: Love being a cop. Fit me like a glove, and I couldn’t get enough of it.

Rosenberg: Now, before we go down this path, we should also explain something unusual about the RCMP, that there’s both, sort of, an enlisted rank and an officer rank.

Paulson: Yeah, so in the RCMP, of course, has a lot of history, a rich history, from you know, it was formed in 1873 when Canadian government and the Canadian country was just simply in the east of Canada, and the west were territories. And in fact, the RCMP was formed to go out and deal with the darn American whiskey traders who were polluting our indigenous folks and Western territories. And so, our primary mission was–and we call it the March West–when the force was formed, a couple of hundred officers, mostly taking from the military, and hence are a rich military tradition. And they marched west into this territory and brought law and order to the west.

Rosenberg: And it wasn’t the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the time. It was–it had a different name.

Paulson: It was called the Northwest Mounted Police, because in the territories, in the northwest. Of course, in modern terms, people question the means by which the whose issues were settled. But I mean, it was a different environment. And certainly, modern notions of justice were foreign to the world back then, and certainly in that territory. And then there was an issue as to whether or not they would be disbanded, or not because they were entering into contractual arrangements with provinces that were being formed in the west, Saskatchewan being one of them. And they were gonna disband them because there was a federal police force called the Dominion Police. But, then they merged them together and made the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. And that’s the origins of the force.

Rosenberg: And the organization you ultimately joined,

Paulson: Ultimately joined, and ultimately led.

Rosenberg: So, explain how there’s both an enlisted rank and an officer rank within the RCMP.

Paulson: Right. So, because of the military traditions, they kept the rank structures and so on the rank structures of the modern RCMP, and they’ve changed little over time. You started out as a constable and you become a corporal and then you become a sergeant and then you become a staff sergeant and you may become the sergeant major. And those are all noncommissioned ranks. The officer, the executive level of the force, starts at the inspector level, and goes like, inspector superintendent, Chief Superintendent, Assistant Commissioner, Deputy commissioner, Commissioner. And so, you seek a commission at the sergeant rank, basically sergeant or staff sergeant, if you’re advanced. It used to be very, very restricted. And now, it’s more, sort of, developmental as we identify people who are good leaders and can be good executives.

Rosenberg: But you started out as a constable?

Paulson: Everyone does. In the RCMP, we insist that all officers come from our enlisted ranks. And so, I started as a constable, and I was particularly interested in the crime solving element of it. I used to read all–you know, off duty, I would go in and read files of murder files or complex robbery files or serial offender files. It just fascinated me because I’d never sort of understood that kind of bad people that were out there. But, you get, as a cop, you begin to sort of get exposed to, holy smokes, I didn’t realize this kind of stuff was going on out there.

Rosenberg: In your own community.

Paulson: In your own community.

Rosenberg: You don’t see it.

Rosenberg: That’s right.

Rosenberg: As a civilian.

Paulson: Yeah, particularly in great countries like we’re blessed to live in, right. We’re by and large, mostly safe.

Rosenberg: We are.

Paulson: My eldest daughter, who’s now a federal prosecutor in Vancouver, probably won’t like me telling this story, but on my days off, we would work shifts. So, four on, four off, right? Twelve hour shifts. On my days off, I get her, my dog would go into my jeep.

Rosenberg: Your dog, Sam.

Paulson: My dog Sam. It was a big black lab. And we’d drive around town and look for people that I had warrants for. And they got, you know, 18-month-old baby in the back in the car seat.

Rosenberg: And a big old, lab

Paulson: Big lab and we’re putting the arm on these guys. And I loved it, and I talked to them all, and I try to understand what drove them and what motivated them.

Rosenberg: And you’re good at talking to people.

Paulson: I am good at talking to people, yeah.

Rosenberg: Do you like that?

Paulson: Yeah, I do. I do like it. I like, I like reaching inside because I–and it goes back to my failure before–like, life’s, life’s challenging. Life can be hard. And everybody faces some sort of adversity. And when you can tap into people’s challenges and, you know, offer a hand, it’s very rewarding.

Rosenberg: I imagine as a constable on the streets of

Paulson: Chilliwack,

Rosenberg: Chilliwack.

Paulson: Yeah,

Rosenberg: You run into lots of addiction problems, mental health problems, people who are down and out for various reasons.

Paulson: But, there’s another, there’s another, sort of, awakening in me, is understanding what was driving criminality, because I took–in in Bob’s simple world, you have people who, sort of, are driven by consequence to crime. You know, they have no money, they have drug addictions, they have alcohol problems, they have familial difficulties. And they have to do something in order to live. And then, you’ve got the, sort of, I want to be a bad guy, class of person, and we can talk about them later. But my early my early exposure to that was that mostly, for example, burglaries. We started big problem burglaries. So, if you had a clearance rate of, a clearance rate being how many of the burglaries that you solve of 20 percent, you were doing really, really good, right.

Rosenberg: So, largely, an unsolved crime.

Paulson: Yeah, but if you stop and think who’s doing who’s doing burglaries in a town, who does that right. It’s people that need the instant access to cash, to get drugs, to get booze. Kids who want toys that they don’t have, kids who want stereos. It’s not hard to figure out.

Rosenberg: So, the distinction you would make there, is people forced to crime as opposed to attracted to crime.

Paulson: Exactly. Exactly. Or interested in crime, right. Early on in my career, I was putting that together. I was very lucky in the kind of people I got to be with as I came up in the job. Very, very lucky. And my trainer used to insist that on every burglary, you go and do a series of inquiries in the neighborhood, and find out who’s who. Every neighborhood has its own character. And it’s not, it’s not exceedingly difficult to figure out who’s doing the burglaries. And so, I would do that, and I’d talk to all the neighbors. If you’ve seen anything he had any trouble, any? Oh, yeah, we’ve seen this Pinto That’s been–you remember the Ford Pinto? Very distinctive looking car. And it was, I think, a pink or a red one. So, I was writing it all up and I was giving it to the detectives and I was on the hunt for this Pinto. I go home from a night shift, first night shift, the burglary street crew guys. They find this Pinto. They find a woman who’s driving it, and they find some, some property that they can attribute to a crime. And so, they arrest her. And when I get to work that night, she’s in cells in a strait-jacket. And so, I talked to the burglar guys and I said, “so what she’s got?” They said, “now she won’t talk. She will not talk. She’s gone nuts. She’s DTA. She’s throwing herself against the bar. ”She’s sort of coming down off of drugs, off of heroin. She was a heroin addict. And so, they were only going to be able to charge her with possession of stolen property, which was what was in the car. And the link to possession, you know, easy to say, hard to prove. You got to show that she had knowledge that those things were in the car. So, long story, long story short, it wasn’t looking good. Was probably going to get released. So, I went inside her in the cell and she was in a strait-jacket, I started talking to her and got down the floor with her, and she asked for a cigarette. And I smoked in those days. I gave a cigarette and we started talking about her addiction and her problems and her arrest. I said, “you want to go? You want to go in a room and get coffee or something?” “Yeah.” So, I take this jacket off. We go in the room. We’re talking about her. We’re talking about her problems. We’re talking about, you know, how she became addicted. And then she offered up. I’ve have been doing all these burglaries, I’ve been doing all these break ins, is the vernacular.

Rosenberg: Breaking and entering.

Paulson: Yeah, I said: “really? And I thought you were because I saw this Pinto everywhere” I went, I said: “how many have you done?” She said: “Jeez, I don’t know. Hundreds.” “Hundreds? Well, we’ve got to put this together.” Can we put this together and she offered: well, why don’t we do this, officer? Why don’t we get in your car? Because I know the neighbors don’t know the names of the streets. You drive around and I’ll tell you which house it is and. So, I went back and told my boss and he said, “wow, really, I’m going to put Jenkins with you there so she doesn’t run off.” And we went and drove all over town, I cleared 52 burglaries that night just by talking to her, just by being sort of human to her. And that was the, another insight into, into policing, is that it’s a very, very important job, but you can’t just do it on the back of authority.

Rosenberg: I found, as a federal prosecutor, Bob, that really you could talk to just about anyone if you had a degree of empathy, you were willing to listen, put judgment aside, and treat people with civility.

Paulson: Indeed. Indeed. Yeah, and so, that embarked–led me down a path of serious crime work because I was brought into a plainclothes section within the year. Like I’d been on the road for a year now, I’m in plainclothes.

Rosenberg: Canada generally is a low crime, low homicide, low shooting country. It’s a very safe country. Is that a fair characterization?

Paulson: Well, I think if, you know, if the comparison is the United States, I think it is.

Rosenberg: But nevertheless.

Paulson: Yeah. No, it is a relatively safe country. And that’s why I think that when we have violent crimes, or we have serial offenders, or we have those types of really community-shocking crimes, that we, we mobilize, you know, heaven and earth to make sure that we get in front of it. But it’s a growing trend. We have an excess of excessive gun violence in Canada now.

Rosenberg: So, you’re promoted through the ranks of the RCMP. You’re still enlisted, right? You’re not yet a commissioned officer. What do you make that jump?

Paulson: So, I go from Chilliwack. My wife is in the military, so I have to move to another, fairly remote, part of British Columbia, which is on the west side of the country and the West Coast. And, back in uniform again. And then, they start the promotion exercise, they changed the promotion system, such that it’s a knowledge based exam. And so, I aced that, I got the highest mark in the country. So, I’m promoted to corporal in Prince Rupert, which is a very remote area of Canada, it’s on the north west coast of British Columbia. And that was some fascinating policing because I got to do some very interesting work with indigenous folks. And, you know, the RCMP has a long tradition from its origin of dealing with Aboriginal people. Well, we also have a very shameful history of having participated in some of the most notorious incidents with indigenous people in Canada.

Rosenberg: Would you describe some of that?

Paulson: Yeah. So, when I go up to Prince Rupert, there is a massive public outcry, over the recognition that residential schools where indigenous folks, young people were ripped from their families, and put in these, sort of, regional areas for schooling in accordance with the European notions of education. And were just taken from there. And who are the people that we’re doing the use of force element of that enforcement? It was the RCMP, but we did an investigation to try and reconcile that because many of the students in the residential schools were abused, some horribly, some, some killed. And it was, it was just a black mark on the country and particularly on the force who participated in that. And so, we’re trying to put some justice to it. And we did a national investigation to find these people. But I’ll tell you a quick story that was really–I used it when I apologized on behalf of the RCMP, to the Aboriginal people of Canada.

Rosenberg: This is when you were a commissioner.

Paulson: When I was commissioner, I offer this apology. But when I was a corporal, I was tasked with investigating all these people, these list of students, go find these students and find out what happened to them. And so, I’m traveling all over the northwest of British Columbia looking for these. One guy left on the list, I couldn’t find, and he was in a community called Terrace, British Columbia, which is a little bit more north than on the coast as well. Turns out, what I could find about him was that he had succumbed to drugs and alcohol and it was a street person. And, you know, good luck finding a street person if they didn’t want to be found. But, I had the local detachment look out for him. And if ever they found him, get him into a tank, and sober him up. And I wherever I was, I’d be there. And so, I got–we found him. So, I show up, and he’s in bad, bad shape. So, we give him rest. We clean him up and get him to an interview room and the man’s a victim. So, we think we shouldn’t be treating him like he’s a crook. And he wants to know what this is all about. And I tell him a little bit about it. We go through his history, and he’s telling me the history of his experience with residential school, and how he was abused there by one of the priests at this particular school. And he was old enough that he knew they didn’t want to have that happen to him. And so, he ran away from the school. And so, what would happen when they ran away from the school? He went home and his parents were trying to hide him. But guess who showed up to take him away?

Rosenberg: The RCMP.

Paulson: The RCMP, and forced them back in there and he says: “and then it happened again.” And then he went through this, what I referred to, as a moment of clarity that we had between us as we both broke into tears, and we realized his whole life had been wasted and destroyed because of what had happened,

Rosenberg: Had been stolen from him.

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah. It’s a very profound moment.

Rosenberg: What happened to him, Bob?

Paulson: Well, he was, you know, ultimately compensated, as all the victims were. But there’s no giving a person back their life, right. But it was an education for me to understand the consequences of these sort of decisions that institutions make, or other governments make, and institutions implement and how, you know, there needs to be some consideration put into those things. And it was–it stayed with me all my life.

Rosenberg: But credit to the RCMP for helping to fix a horrific problem that they had contributed to.

Paulson: Right.

Rosenberg: Earlier in their history.

Paulson: One of the things with the RCMP that’s interesting, is that the history the RCMP is very iconic in Canada.

Rosenberg: It’s iconic in the United States, too. I mean, we all have an image of that RCMP Mountie.

Paulson: Right. And, you know, the idea that, that the history and the image and the, sort of, weight of the identity of the force, and that’s how we refer to it, the force, as though it’s in a Star Wars, that somehow that is relevant to decisions that leaders make in the execution of their duties as law enforcement officers, whether it be federally, provincially, or municipally. It was a characteristic that I think hurt the RCMP, right. Because we both wanted to stay in history and retain that iconic, classic, sort of, image, and not modernize, not let go of some of those things. So the idea that decisions, modern decisions being made on the back of history and not on their merits, not on the current reality, not on principle and values, was something that that I came to try to fix in the RCMP. And it was difficult.

Rosenberg: When did you become an officer, Bob?

Paulson: So, I was commissioned to the rank of inspector in late 2001, and I was put into a position called the Major Case Manager for Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs in British Columbia. And I was put there, by and large, well, entirely, by one of my most influential mentors, who was a guy called Gary Bass, who was then, the criminal operations officer for the province of British Columbia. So, he was like the number two police officer. But he was in charge of operations. He says, “congratulations, Bob, you’re an inspector.” I said, “yes. So, I’m going to need, you know, meet, need some people. I need some money.” And he says, “well, you’re not to go figure that out.” But he wanted me to attack the Hell’s Angels, who had been there, too, for untouched. In terms of criminal investigations, they’re very resilient. And depending on where they are, in which chapters, like the B.C. chapters of the Hell’s Angels are the most successful.

Rosenberg: The British Columbia chapter.

Paulson: British Columbia. Yes, British Columbia chapter most successful, richest ,and influential

Rosenberg: And violent.

Paulson: And violent in the world.

Rosenberg: And how did the Hells Angels sort of infiltrate British Columbia? This wonderful, beautiful, pastoral part of your country?

Paulson: Well, it’s interesting. The history is the mafia in Montreal where, in partnership with the Hells Angels in Montreal. And they sent out people to, sort of, build the grassroots of the Hells Angels out there.

Rosenberg: So, very much by design.

Paulson: Oh, entirely by design. They’re a very strategic organization. And if we could be a strategic in some of the things that we did as they were in the things that they did, we’d be much–in fact, that, you know, I lecture often about leadership and so on. And one of the things that you have to put on those characteristics of effective leaders is morality, because some of the most effective leaders I’ve seen have been criminals. If you measure it simply by, you know, the outcome and, and their, you know, desired outcome.

Rosenberg: And by leadership, you’re not talking about values based leadership. You’re just talking about the ability to lead.

Paulson: To marshal resources and people towards an outcome.

Rosenberg: OK. So, a brand-new Inspector Paulson, go solve this Hells Angels problem in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Paulson: That’s right.

Rosenberg: What did you do?

Paulson: Well, I went around to everybody who had money and resources and people, and persuaded them to give me some of them. So, because I was able to draw a picture of many of the murders that were happening and many of the recent unprosecuted drug seizures that we had, I was able to identify a target group. And I was able to persuade people that we are going to be successful if we are able to infiltrate them, if we’re able to use people from within to betray them, effectively. And if you’ve got experience with organized crime groups, and particularly successful organized crime groups, that’s one of the only ways–like they’re impervious to wiretaps, simply. The Hells Angels in British Columbia would have their lawyers hold seminars on crime solving techniques, such that when they would go for their walk and talks–walk and talks are a cop vernacular for a sneaky conversation that you can’t hear–they’d always sort of throw their arms around each other and talk in their ears, whispering in their ears. Ultimately, when I got an agent, I had my wife, so a microphone into his collar to pick up those conversations. And, but they’re strategic, right. They know what they want to do.

Rosenberg: Very careful. Good operational security.

Paulson: Right. And well instructed, right, well-prepared.

Rosenberg: And so how do you infiltrate a group like that?

Paulson: You target someone within their organization, and you use intelligence to recruit them, right. Either through circumstance that brings it to their advantage. In other words, you know, they’re in a jackpot and they need to get out of the jackpot. And they meet the, sort of, characteristics of a cooperative informant. And you can work them.

Rosenberg: Because unlike in the movies or in television, embedding an undercover in an organization like that is extraordinarily difficult.

Paulson: Very difficult, very difficult and impossible in the Hell’s Angels, because they have a very hierarchical sort of progressive development of these individuals. And they need–they do a history check on who you are and people vote for them and they do neighborhood inquiries like cops ought to do. They have puppet clubs, these clubs, puppet clubs are, are sort of, secondary, not full Hell’s Angels. They have other foolish names like, you know, The Reckoners or the Skull Daggers or whatever.

Rosenberg: But they’re affiliated.

Paulson: They’re affiliated. And they’re–you know, the Hells Angels use nominees to do most of their hands-on crime. And one of them, when I got into a fight with his wife and she burned down his house and he was in Prince George, which is in the north of the province. And I got wind of that, got in my car and drove up, had him brought in, and all his money was in the wall of this house, and was all burnt. And he didn’t have any more money. And he was the president of this club in Prince George.

Rosenberg: He was unhappy.

Paulson: He was vulnerable to recruitment. And so, speaking of Gary Bass again, so I talked to him and we talked about how we could maybe help his life out a little bit. And he said, you know, “50-grand. We could talk.” I didn’t have 50-grand. Drove all the way back to Vancouver from Kamloops about a two-and-a half hour drive. Got the approval. I got 50 grand, big wad of cash, stuffed it in my pants, drove back to the hotel room and then I’m 50 grand. I said, we have a deal. We got a deal. I stood up, shook my hands, took money from my belt, to his belt, and off we went.

Rosenberg: And you were in?

Paulson: We were in.

Rosenberg: And he abided by the deal.

Paulson: He did.

Rosenberg: What did what did he do for you?

Paulson: First of all, he informed us as to the realities of criminality within the relationship between his club and the Vancouver chapter of the Hells Angels. And then he was dealing and he was wearing a wire and he was putting a video where we needed it because we needed we need persuasive evidence. All right. Just even calling him a person of dubious character. Like he’s not going to be your star witness unless he’s corroborated excessively and completely by video, by audio. And so, what we wanted to do, is to have him develop and get up in the organization, you know, reach those successive layers.

Rosenberg: And that’s going to require some patience.

Paulson: It’s going to require patience. But it’s also going to require this because it’s gonna get a little legal. I’ll try to keep it simple, but because of the nature of the crime that they are doing, which is all nominee crime. Right. In other words, they would have their, their “mopes,” as we’d call them, go do the hands-on stuff. So, a full-patch Hell’s Angels would have a series of hang arounds that they would be very careful in giving instructions often would have instructions tiered down to those people.

Rosenberg: Giving the leadership of the Hells Angels some plausible deniability if things went bad

Paulson: Right. Insulation from the actual oil that you might get on your hands when you’re holding a wrench. So, in order to get to them, this guy had to get access to them, in order to get access to them, he had to be successful at doing what he was being told to do by lower level people. And so that required what we referred to as: allowing drugs to remain in circulation. So, there was one of these guys that was overseeing a series of meth production labs.

Rosenberg: And so, our listeners know, that it is a very difficult thing for law enforcement to do. In fact, in the United States, we have an obligation to take those drugs off the street.

Paulson: That’s right. That’s exactly right. Our policy in the day, the RCMP policy, was not to allow drugs to remain in circulation.

Rosenberg: People get hurt.

Paulson: People get hurt and then you’ve got your hands on it, right? And in fact, that I testified for weeks at this, ultimately, this trial on this very issue, because I was being accused, unsuccessfully, I might add, of adding to the risk that associates to these serious, serious drugs. But, for instance, he would be–our, our agent would be tasked to go to person A pickup, three kilos of meth, take them to person B, C and D, hand them off. Take the money. Bring it back. Put it into place and then come back and report.

Rosenberg: And in part, it’s because there’s an interest in letting the criminal enterprise run, gathering more intelligence, and having your informant sort of, ascend the ranks.

Paulson: Exactly.

Rosenberg: The tradeoff, of course, is that drugs are remaining in circulation.

Paulson: Indeed. And that was it. And so, we had to, we had to, sort of, devise a method that on principle that could be palatable not just to the RCMP, but to the courts, and ultimately, the Canadian public.

Rosenberg: To the society that you serve.

Paulson: Exactly. And weighing the proportional sort of harm that comes from allowing three kilos of meth to remain in circulation, but getting the guys that’s going to drive about five or six more labs.

Rosenberg: And this is not a class from hypothetical. This is something you have to wrestle with in real time. But the consequences, the morality of the legality.

Paulson: Exactly. It’s very difficult. And so, what we came up with because of the law allowed for it.

Rosenberg: In Canada.

Paulson: The law allows for it. Yeah, both controlled drugs and substances act as it then once and the criminal code contemplates police, or those working for the police, to engage in activity which would otherwise be criminal. And we’ve done in other areas where we wouldn’t have undercover officers. You know, for credibility, go slash tires of a car or something, or break a window, or break into a place or represent some sort of criminality. The means to do that was very elaborate and required authorities, and documented proportionality assessments, and wings that was quite elaborate and very sophisticated. Yet in our controlled Drugs and Substances Act, it wasn’t quite as elaborate. You were just simply under the guidance in a real investigation, you were allowed to embark on activities which would otherwise contravene the act. Anyway, so the law allowed for it, policy didn’t. I had to persuade people in Ottawa that, you know, Bob had a system that would be successful. And we documented every transaction and we did that proportionality weight in advance of the decision to allow things to go on. And sometimes, we would invest tremendous money at continuing surveillance for days until it was clear, or at least in our judgment, it was clear, that our agent would not be put at risk by the seizure. Right, and so, we would do everything to take the drugs out. And so that went on for a couple of years. It burned our agent out, but we were very successful and ultimately brought charges against a bunch of those bad guys. It didn’t stop the Hell’s Angels, but it just demonstrated that they were vulnerable. And there’s been a success of, sort of, series of successful prosecutions against them. But, you know, you had to up your game. You couldn’t just go, you know, follow the motorcycles around and hope that they were going to fall into some sort of handcuff.

Rosenberg: Now, you have to be proactive and creative and be willing to take a risk.

Paulson: Yeah, that’s right. And be able to defend the risk in a sort of principled way.

Rosenberg: Bob, there is a downside to doing such good work in British Columbia. I assume that the bosses back in Ottawa notice you in your work.

Paulson: They did. In fact, I had to go to Ottawa frequently for authorities, for some of the, kind of, bleeding edge stuff I was doing. And so, yeah, I got noticed. And I was I was offered a promotion to Ottawa, which I turned down.

Rosenberg: And why do you turn it down?

Paulson: Well, my family then, was grounded in the lower mainland.

Rosenberg: For us Americans.

Paulson: British Columbia. And they were very happy. They didn’t want to move. My wife didn’t want to move. And frankly, I was I was pretty happy. I wasn’t I was ambitious, but not ambitious in the get to the top of the force thing, I wanted to get sufficient authority to do the things I wanted to do.

Rosenberg: You wanted to resolve cases?

Paulson: Exactly. Exactly. And the higher up you get, the less sort of influence you have on individual cases, and the more responsibility you have for the systems and processes that guide those individual systems or those individual investigations. So, I didn’t want to move and I turned it down, and there was a bit of a consequence, although I was promoted, thanks to Gary Bass to superintendent in British Columbia.

Rosenberg: That’s a big job.

Paulson: It is a big job. And I was completed a mile and many put me in charge of community and aboriginal policing. And that–so I wasn’t doing investigations anymore. And then Ottawa came calling again and said they’d like me to go to Ottawa at a sort of entry level into the senior executive ranks.

Rosenberg: As a practical matter, can you say no again?

Paulson: I could have said no, but that had been the end of Bob again, right. That had been the end of Bob, the influential police officer. So, I persuaded my family to come along and we, we moved to Ottawa in 2006.

Rosenberg: Were you missing British Columbia?

Paulson: I was, yeah. I was missing, I was missing the work. But, I ended up being in charge of criminal intelligence. And then, I became the operations officer national security and ultimately promoted to the assistant commissioner in charge of national security at the time when the national security file was hopping. And that was a very exciting time, you know, coming from the major crime world, and having developed what, many have called this major case management, which is this sort of doctrine for how to support major cases to prosecution, I was able to bring some of that to to the world of national security and it was a great, great time. But there was a deputy commissioner who didn’t like me. So, Paulson wasn’t a good guy.

Rosenberg: How could that be?

Paulson: I know. Look at me. Listen to me. And I don’t know why he was he was very self-interested. And he did, unabashedly, have his eyes set on the commissioner’s chair

Rosenberg: And the commissioner and the RCMP, traditionally, at least came from within the ranks of the RCMP. Right.

Paulson: Yeah, exactly.

Rosenberg: Which is a little bit different, by the way, than the FBI director, who traditionally has never served as a special agent, for instance.

Paulson: Well, that’s right. And then, so this deputy commissioner was serving under the first civilian commissioner from the outside that we’d ever had.

Rosenberg: First, and only.

Paulson: First, and only, Bill Elliott, who I came to serve under at that point, I was off in contract policing.

Rosenberg: What does that mean, Bob?

Paulson: So, contract policing is the role where we create policies and oversight for our contractual arrangements with the provinces and municipalities. And so, t

Rosenberg: His is in the RCMP, his role as other than the federal police

Paulson: As the response to call people the provincial police force, the municipal police force. And from there, I was promoted to Deputy Commissioner in charge of federal policing, which is effectively the number two position. People in the contracts don’t like to hear this. It’s our core business. That’s why the organization exists, to do federal policing, national security, federal statutes, international obligations, protective policing. It is, in and of itself, a significant mandate. Many of the agencies, the United States, are created to do those specific things. In Canada, we have the one agency doing it. Then, the civilian commissioner retired after four years. And then, there was a competition. I went in the competition, and Prime Minister Harper called me to his office one day and said, “look, I’m considering appointing you to the commissioner, but I think I should probably talk to you first.” It was very process oriented, straightforward guy.

Rosenberg: You liked him?

Paulson: I liked the man and I liked his style. I liked how principled he was. But the fact that there was a political push to have someone else appointed commissioner, he didn’t know me from Adam.

Rosenberg: So, how did you come to his attention then, Bob?

Paulson: Through this process, you know, he says we need a commissioner, the RCMP. Do I want to appoint someone who’s sort of lined up to the conservatives, or do we want to run a process and try and select the most capable candidate for this? And the process ran. I went along. There was psychometric testing. There was a series of interviews.

Rosenberg: Must have been a bit of a head spinner. At one point, you’re on the floor of a jail cell sharing a cigarette with a woman in a straitjacket, who’s committed, you know, 52 burglaries, and now you’re in the office of the prime minister of Canada being interviewed to be the next commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Paulson: Absolute head spinner. You know, until I was the deputy commissioner and I was acting often for this civilian commissioner because he was–as he was leaving–I thought to myself, you know, I could probably do this job and I could probably fix some of these things I’ve been bellyaching about for years. When I threw my name in the hat, when the headhunter came and saw me and said, would you participate in this process? I said, “yes, I will.” And then I wanted it. And it was the first time I wanted it.

Rosenberg: And what about the moment you got it?

Paulson: Yeah. Then, it was like the dog chasing the car that catches it, right.

Rosenberg: What do I do now? When were you appointed the twenty third commissioner of the RCMP?

Paulson: In December 2011.

Rosenberg: And what did you want to do?

Paulson: I wanted to fix the place. I wanted to restore the trust that had been–it was it was being shaken as I was being appointed. There was a series of slow, terrible disclosures by female officers who had suffered harassment and sexual harassment and sexual violence, even at the hands of some of their supervisors. It was just shaking the place. I remember standing in the lobby of the House Commons next to the Minister, who was the minister of public safety, then announcing my appointment. And there was a series of reporters, a horseshoe of reporters and lights and cameras. And they weren’t all smiling. All right. They weren’t all sharing the moment with Bob.

Rosenberg: They weren’t as happy as you.

Paulson: Wanted to rip me limb from limb and say, what? What are you going to do about this? Right. And I remember thinking all I could talk about was I was going to bring leadership and accountability to the organization in ways that it hadn’t seen before. And it was going to be difficult, require time, require patience. That’s all I could say.

Rosenberg: With respect to the sexual harassment issues that you found in the RCMP, sounded like it had gone unaddressed. What did you do?

Paulson: I brought process to it. We needed to have a process by which they could be properly investigated. The criticism of that response is: just believe me, I’m here in the media. I’m telling my story. What else do you want? Like, where are these people being arrested? And are our processes and systems for dealing with complaints of harassment were not engendering the trust and the faith of the membership, so that they would have some sort of opportunity to have these complaints resolved in the near term.

Rosenberg: But they may have genuinely felt they didn’t have an avenue within the organization. They had to go outside.

Paulson: They absolutely felt that. They absolutely felt that. And, and lawsuits started mounting up, such that, we needed, you know, a separate office of our legal department to manage them all. And so, ultimately, we needed to get to a place where we could settle the lawsuits, but we couldn’t settle the lawsuits until we had some process by which we could respond, and have the institution recognized as being ready to respond to complaints of harassment, whether they be sexual, or not.

Rosenberg: That’s only a part of the problem. You have to respond to the complaints and have a process to resolve them, but you also have to fix the underlying culture.

Paulson: Right, it just wasn’t modern. And so, it required a number of changes on a number of fronts that recognize that these were not failures of individuals. For example, a young woman in a remote post, maybe there’s three or four officers there, and she wants to have a family, the enormous pressure and judgments and criticisms that she faces by getting pregnant, right, is that you’re, you’re letting the team down. And we’re building a team from the moment we’re bringing people into depot.

Rosenberg: By depot, you mean the RCMP training facility in Saskatchewan?

Paulson: Yeah, we bring 32 people together, and we forge those into a unit so that they understand what the team is. But then when you’re letting the team down because you want to go and have a life, you’re facing judgment. People felt that was their fault. And I said, “no, that’s not their fault. It’s our fault, because we can’t organize ourselves to support that, because the law says that we should support it—“

Rosenberg: –well, and then also it’s also the right thing to do.

Paulson: Right. Right. But it’s not an individual failure. It’s a management failure. We’re failing our people by not providing strategies and systems to support them, to have their lives, while they risk their lives for Canadians. You know, one of the features of an effective leader, in my estimation, one of the characteristics, is an action-oriented implementer, right. Someone who’s prepared to do things. Yes, I know that you’re the deputy commissioner of federal policing, that’s a very nice position you have there, Bob. What do you do when you hang your coat up, and what happens next? Then what do you do?

Rosenberg: What’s the plan?

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah. And so, I started out by–and you may get a kick out of this because our history is talking about the American constitution, which I’m a tremendous fan of.

Rosenberg: I know you read quite a bit about it.

Paulson: We studied it, actually on this course that I was blessed to have, and yeah, I’m a big fan. So, I tried to build a constitution for the RCMP. We have the RCMP Act, in which, you know, and that’s, that’s it, I mean, that’s the law. But I tried to get a document that would sort of frame up interests within the organization, and would frame up how things should roll, where authority lies, and what it means to have authority, and all the things, that was quite a beautiful document that I attached to our administrative manual. But, it had no sort of. You didn’t have any constitutional weight. It couldn’t be slapped over the head of anybody.

Rosenberg: Was that met with resistance, acceptance? How did folks feel about you trying to sort of create a constitution for the RCMP?

Paulson: It was met mostly with an open mouth stare.

Rosenberg: Meaning folks didn’t understand what you were trying to do.

Paulson: Right. You know, shame on me. But that, sort of, informed me a little bit about this sort of magnitude of the task that I was facing, in terms of modernizing.

Rosenberg: You know, it’s interesting. When I ran the DEA, we didn’t have a core values program, and I thought it was important just to articulate what our core values are. And there was a bit of an open mouth reaction. You know, why are we doing this? What do we need it for? How does it help us do our jobs? And the answer is: it may not help today or even tomorrow, but by articulating a set of core values for an organization, you’re framing your work for hopefully generations to come. But it’s a hard thing to explain in just a couple of sentences.

Paulson: Absolutely. And key to changing an organization, let alone, a culture, is having a vision that people can, sort of, attach to and say, “oh, I see what he’s talking about.: But here’s the thing I used to say a lot–I started out when I was a deputy commissioner–I said, you know, everybody’s pulling for the RCMP. Canadians love the RCMP. They want the RCMP to succeed.

Rosenberg: So, do Americans.

Paulson: Yeah. The work we do is important. And that gives us the status that we all sort of roll around in that we’re happy with. The work is important. But let me tell you how we do it. That’s more important. I made a point of lecturing to every commissioned officer class. I would talk about an interest-based leadership model. And according to Bob, the interest-based leadership model places a hierarchy over three, sort of, main interests. The public interest is at the top, organizational interest is at the second place, and employee interest is third place. And then I’d say, what do you think of that? It was like I’d sworn in front of everyone. It’s like I said something really, really bad because the idea of leadership is that you’re looking after people, like you can’t be a leader without people, you gotta look after your people, but you’ve got to be able to do it with a mission in mind, the organization’s mission, and you’ve gotta, sort of, be guided by the public interest. And there are people that are making decisions out of personal interest for promotions, for whatever, people that are making decisions that aren’t weighing on the organizational impact, which is not the image of the force, but the organizational interest is not being respected in the discharge of your duties. Back to Lieutenant Paulson getting his first assessment, you know, on the flight line, being told, hey, pal, you’re not. You know, you might think you have a couple of ranks up on your shoulder,

Rosenberg: But you’re not cutting it.

Paulson: You’re not cutting it and you’re not doing–you’re not honoring the contract that put those stars on your shoulder. You’re not doing that. So, you better start doing it. That was how I approach some of those things. And it was a–it was fascinating discussion with those young officers because they’d done decisions. And often in police work, decisions can be contained within the facts that you’re facing. But as you get up in rank, and you begin to take more responsibility, you’ve got to cover those things with some other interests besides, you know, your own y

Rosenberg: Our best leaders should have the broadest view.

Paulson: Exactly.

Rosenberg: And should understand why without having to be prompted. Public interest is more important than personal interest, or even, as you say, organizational interests.

Paulson: Indeed.

Rosenberg: Hard to find those people aren’t.

Paulson: And it’s hard even as I sit here today, as we militarize more and more, we’re bringing ourselves farther and farther away from the people that we are policing. And if policing means guard over the flock with the best, deadliest weapons, then OK, but that’s not what it is. And it’s a difficult conversation, particularly with the profession, because there’s some very strong emotions that form part of this deliberation.

Rosenberg: You know, we wrestle, too, in the United States, with this notion of police militarization. And I’ve always said: “it’s not the stuff. It’s how we use this stuff.” So, it’s one thing for a police department in a big city to have an armored personnel carrier. There might be a time that they need it, but they have to be very careful about rolling it out for an ordinary protest.

Paulson: Exactly. You need the equipment. But so, my position was, yeah, have the equipment. I remember I got into a shouting match with a subordinate officer in front of a senior officer when I was in contract. Please. So, I’m an assistant commissioner. We’re having a meeting in front of the deputy commissioner, and the chief superintendent, who is one rank below me, we’re talking about water cannons because we had the G-8 or G. 20 going on in Toronto. And he says, “yes, I got a water cannon, and we’re driving it down to Toronto.” I said: “what you mean you got to water cannon?” Well, we got one again. Where’d you get that? We bought it. “So, who’s who’s, who’s working it?” “I don’t know.

We’ll get there when we get there, their guys, the emergency response guys, they’ll work it.” “Under what conditions?” Well, like things get out of hand. Understood as what? So, but I felt when I was asking those questions, like I was outside of the police value system. Paulson, do you not get this? No, I get it. But you get what’s gonna happen when we deploy this water cannon and kill little Jimmy, who is just out there for his first protest. And we have two years of inquiry to live through. Like who do I referred them to, you know, like use your head so you can have the equipment we need the equipment in. And it’s like when I was saying earlier about, about how important the RCMP is to Canadians and what we do. Yeah, yeah. How do we do it, though? That’s really important. And people aren’t putting their minds to how we’re doing what is so important. It’s like you just occupy the uniform and put on the high browns and the Stetson, and people clap. There’s more to the job than just occupying the position. And that’s the cultural change I was after.

Rosenberg: I’d be remiss, Bob, if I didn’t ask you about your oath of office.

Paulson: Right.

Rosenberg: The oath that a young man or woman would take to become a Mountie.

Paulson: Yeah. And I’d sent you the oath from the Northwest Mounted Police. And the first oath is to the queen or the king.

Rosenberg: The head of state.

Paulson: The head of state. The other one, which is very interesting and is one that I always reminded people of, was this one, the oath of office, and it talks about, for example, Mr. Evans here, solemnly swore that he would faithfully, diligently and impartially execute and perform the duties required of him as a member of the Northwest Mounted Police, and will well and truly obey and perform all lawful orders and instructions which I shall receive as such, without fear, favour or affection of, or towards any person or party whomsoever. So, help him God. And my favorite part of that is the without fear, favour, or affection. And what that speaks to in terms of values and the qualities of effective leadership–I often maintain that one of the under-recognized or perhaps, mis-understood qualities is one of courage that leaders have to have and courage, not in the traditional sense of facing the lion, or wrestling bad guys, or getting into fights, but having the courage to live and think and be in a way that respects the values in the organization, and takes courage. And until you’re placed in those situations where you have to execute on that, I don’t think people understand how much courage it takes to make the right decision in the face of consequences

Rosenberg: And uncertainty.

Paulson: Yeah.

Rosenberg: So, this is an oath of allegiance taken by a gentleman named Warren Wells Evans. And I can’t quite read the date, but it’s April of 1890-something.

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah.

Rosenberg: Is it the same oath today?

Paulson: It’s a little different today.

Rosenberg: Does it still contain the fear, favour, or affection language?

Paulson: No, it doesn’t. They took it out which is which is sad and just diligently and honestly.

Rosenberg: But again, your obligation is not to a particular person or party, it’s to the law.

Paulson: Absolutely. To the rule of law. For police officers, you’ll always be faced with that. You’ll always have to choose. And for the most part, we all make the right decisions.

Rosenberg: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Bob, is, as we discussed, iconic, legendary. We know it in the United States. And we deeply respect it. As you said, it’s always had a very good relationship with the citizens of Canada. Do you miss it?

Paulson: Yeah, I miss–I miss the people. I miss doing the police work.

Rosenberg: Have you been able to get back into police work, Bob?

Paulson: Well, I wanted to, and one of the things that I did prior to leaving as commissioner, was I upped the reserve program because we we’re short of police officers.

Rosenberg: And so, after about six months of having left office, I rode over to the reserve office, and I sent them an application. Former Commissioner Bob Paulson as a reserve officer Paulson.

Paulson: Yeah. I didn’t tell anybody. I didn’t tell my wife. And so, I got a call from the deputy commissioner: “what’s going on?” I go: “what I. I just wanted to take a crack at it.” I understand. I’m probably not going to. Probably not gonna go there. But I do miss it. I do miss the work.

Rosenberg: Well, Bob, I’m really grateful for a couple of things for your remarkable service to the people of Canada as an officer, as a constable, and as a commissioner of the RCMP, but also for taking some time to sit down with us today and tell us about it. It’s a truly inspirational story.

Paulson: Well, thank you very much, Chuck. Thanks for the opportunity.

Rosenberg: It’s certainly our pleasure. Thank you for your time, Bob.

* In a bit of a surprise, CNN’s new national poll found Joe Biden leading Elizabeth Warren, 34% to 19%, in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. A month ago, Biden led Warren by a smaller margin, 24% to 18%. Bernie Sanders was third in the latest poll with 16%, down a point since CNN’s September poll.

* The same poll found Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke tied for sixth place with 3% each, which is important because it brings each of them a little closer to qualifying for next month’s primary debate. (The Minnesota senator needs just one more poll at 3% or greater to become eligible.)

* Speaking of polling, a new Quinnipiac poll, for the first time, found that a 48% plurality of Americans support impeaching Donald Trump and removing him from office. The same poll found the president with a 38% approval rating, down three points from the last Quinnipiac survey.

* In yet another poll, Emerson offered Bernie Sanders better news: it found Biden with a narrow lead over the Vermont senator nationally, 27% to 25%, with Warren close behind with 21%.

* Speaking of Warren, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney (D) endorsed the Massachusetts senator this morning. He’s the first big-city mayor to publicly announce his support for Warren.

* With only two weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, William Woods, a Republican who ran against Gov. Matt Bevin in a GOP primary, this week announced his support for the governor’s Democratic challenger, state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D). “This election isn’t about politics for me,” Woods said on Monday night. “I’m ready for a governor who will respect all of us regardless of political affiliation.”

* Kansas Democrats’ U.S. Senate primary got a little more straightforward a few days ago, when former U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom ended his campaign and endorsed state Sen. Barbara Bollier (D). Bollier is perhaps best known as the former Republican who left the party over its radicalism.

* And the Washington Post’s Eugene Scott noted late yesterday that while some of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s (D-Hawaii) 2020 rivals have defended her from claims that she’s a Russian asset, “some have argued that Gabbard doesn’t have to be proactively working with Russia for that government to be using her campaign to interfere in the 2020 election.”"

* On a related note, Amy Klobuchar was sixth in the poll with 3%, which means the Minnesota senator has now qualified to participate in next month’s Democratic primary debate. For now, she’s one of nine candidates to meet the participation threshold.

* The latest Monmouth poll in South Carolina found Biden leading Warren, 33% to 16%, which is a much closer advantage than the same poll showed in July. Sanders is third in the poll with 12%.

* In Wisconsin, which is arguably the most important 2020 battleground state, the latest Marquette University Law School poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in the state by six points, 50% to 44%. The same results showed Sanders leading the president in the Badger State by two points, while Warren was up by one point. Marquette found Pete Buttigieg trailing Trump in a hypothetical matchup by two points.

* After briefly expressing tacit support for a presidential impeachment inquiry, Rep. Mark Amodei (R) has apparently lost his spot chairing Trump’s re-election campaign in Nevada.

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, grabs the support of 28 percent of Democrats and independent voters who lean toward the Democrats in a survey released Thursday by Quinnipiac University. Biden stands at 21 percent in the poll, with populist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 15 percent.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In Quinnipiac’s previous survey – conducted prior to the Oct. 15 fourth round Democratic debate – Warren had a slight 30-27 percent edge over Biden. But her advantage was within the poll’s margin of error. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid, was at 11 percent.

Quinnipiac’s new survey showing Warren with a clear lead outside the sampling error stands in stark contrast to a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS released a day earlier that suggested Biden at 34 percent, with Warren a distant second at 19 percent and Sanders at 16 percent. The former vice president’s 15 percentage point lead was his largest since April in CNN polling.

During the spring and summer Biden remained the unrivaled front-runner in the Democratic 2020 battle, but then Warren surged and has been tied with the former vice president in many national and early primary and caucus voting state polls this autumn.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg grabs 10 percent support in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 3 percent. According to Klobuchar’s campaign, their candidate has now reached the polling threshold and qualifies for the next debate, which will be held next month in Georgia.

No other candidate in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders topped 1 percent in the poll.

""Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement.

The survey indicates Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against President Trump in the 2020 election. But his electability has deteriorated, from a high of 56 percent days after he declared his candidacy in late April, to 42 percent now.

Thirty percent of those questioned say Warren has the best policy ideas, topping the rest of the field. And Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic White House contender, at 28 percent.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Among the nearly three-quarters of those polled who said they either watched October’s debate or paid close attention to news stories about it, 26 percent said Warren did the best job, followed by Buttigieg with 17 percent, Biden with 12 percent, Sanders at 11 percent, and Klobuchar at 8 percent. When asked who did the worst job in the recent debate, 15 percent said Biden and 11 percent said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

""Despite coming under attack at the debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren was viewed as doing the best job, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig, which may have helped his standing in the primary,” Snow said. ""Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Oct. 17 - 21, with 1,587 self-identified registered voters — including 713 Democratic voters and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of effort for Democratic primary questions is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

Even the establishment media are getting fed up with her evasive answers.

Warren wants you to think she will only raise taxes on “the wealthy.” But her “Medicare-for-all” plan would impose massive tax increases on the middle class.

When questioned by the press as to whether her plan will involve higher middle-class taxes, Warren continues to bob and weave and dodge the question.

STUDY: EXORBITANT TAXES ON RICH AND CORPORATIONS WOULD COVER LESS THAN HALF OF 'MEDICARE FOR ALL'S' COSTS

In advance of the last debate by Democratic presidential candidates, Americans for Tax Reform released a video compilation of Warren’s middle-class tax dodges. It shows Warren dodging the question on at least 17 different occasions, all around the country. During the after the debate, she dodged the question another eight times.

Big media names on the left are growing exasperated as Warren refuses to level with them.

“Why don’t you want to answer the question?” said MSNBC’s Chris Matthews after trying to get an answer out of her on seven times in a row. Finally, he threw in the towel and said: “I’m not getting anywhere.”

During an interview with Stephen Colbert, Warren was asked: “How are you going to pay for it? Are you going to raise the middle-class taxes?""

As Warren ramped up her usual long-winded dodge, Colbert cut her off and said: “I've listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion for you about how you might defend the taxes that perhaps you're not mentioning.""

Even Warren’s Democratic primary opponents are finally calling her out. The day after the last debate, former Vice President Joe Biden said her evasiveness is raising questions about “whether or not she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people.”

Warren fashions herself a serious policy person who will level with the American people. But she’s just another tax-and-spend liberal who has a problem telling the truth.

As it turns out, Americans know they already pay enough in taxes. They also know the games Democrats play with tax rhetoric: A promise during the campaign to only raise taxes on a tiny part of the very wealthiest Scrooge McDucks.

But once in office, the Democratic politicians “discover” by golly that they, in fact, will be imposing tax increases on nearly everyone.

Warren has extraordinarily expensive big plans, funded courtesy of your wallet. Her plans will intrude into every aspect of American life.

It’s no wonder Warren has already endorsed a long list of tax increases including a carbon dioxide tax – a new national energy tax that will drastically increase costs for Americans.

A carbon tax is so toxic with voters that even the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign purposefully steered clear of it. Her campaign wrote an internal memo noting that a carbon tax would “disproportionately impact low-income households.”

Warren has also endorsed a 30 percent national gun tax, making it more expensive for households to protect themselves. Her gun tax plan has a deliberate goal of reducing gun ownership in the United States – an attempt to tax the Second Amendment out of existence.

Warren seems to have a problem telling the truth about her policies. But if she gets the Democratic nomination, there will be a historic contrast on taxes. Warren wants to raise your taxes. President Trump wants to cut taxes. Voters won’t be fooled."

""It's just this outlandish worldview that Elizabeth Warren has that will drive people that may not be thrilled with everything that President Trump is doing -- but under the circumstances of being given a choice between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, they're going to go with Donald Trump.""

""It's incredible how badly the Democratic party is screwing this up for themselves. It's amazing. They've got one left-wing nut after the next on television,"" he told Fox News.

WATCH: ELIZABETH WARREN DODGES QUESTION ON HOW SHE WOULD FUND 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

His comments came just days before he's set to sit down at Politicon with Fox News contributor Donna Brazile who, like Priebus, served as chair of her respective party during the 2016 presidential election. He will expand on the atmosphere surrounding 2020 and talk about the direction of the country. Priebus will also participate in a panel on Republicans’ electoral prospects following Trump’s first term at Politicon.

Voters in the U.S., Priebus told Fox, mostly weren't concerned with policies like reparations or ""Medicare for all."" Instead, they focused on issues like manufacturing and jobs. Priebus argued that voters would have a harder time deciding between Trump and candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, or Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was a ""close second"" behind Warren for Priebus' chosen nominee. “He’s a little Trumpy … I think his rhetoric flows well, better than Elizabeth Warren, with blue-collar workers in the midwest -- kind of his middle finger type philosophy to just a lot of things that folks claim is unfair,"" he said of Sanders.

According to Priebus, Trump and Republicans were ""brilliant"" to focus on the Democrats' more progressive elements like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her ""squad"" of progressive freshmen. “There’s nothing more you want to do than give people a stark contrast in the ballot box -- so when people go to vote, they want to see night and day as far as a choice,"" he said.

He added that ""extreme"" Democratic policies in Washington, D.C., were making it more likely that reluctant Trump donors would pull out their checkbook and support his re-election.

But none of the party's frontrunners, he argued, were able to appeal to both a progressive base and midwestern voters. And although Biden was the more likable Democrat, he wasn't credible on left-wing policies, Priebus said.

""So, they have nothing. They don’t have a complete candidate who can do both which is why you’re seeing people like [Michael] Bloomberg dipping his toe in, you saw the poll last week about Michelle Obama -- that she would be the frontrunner. The Democrats are desperate,"" he said.

Biden's prospects, Priebus added, were much worse than Trump's were during the 2016 primaries. He argued that Trump ""was never really behind"" and, as a consequence, Republican National Committee delegates didn't have anywhere to go other than supporting Trump.

Biden, on the other hand, could face a brokered convention where he may need to shore up progressives due to the nature of Democratic politics. Democrats, he said, had “real tight race among three or four people and they also shell out most of their delegates on a proportional basis at their conventions … and in their primary battles.”

Priebus also put the kibosh on any chance that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton could enter the race and win in 2020. ""I think she's pretty much-damaged goods at this point,"" he said. He argued that Warren faced the same flaw that Clinton did in 2016: neither were ""likable.""

Trump, he added, delivered on his promise to ""blow things up"" in Washington and was immune to the controversies that would doom any other politician. “He’s judged by the American people on a different standard. He’s immune from all of these controversies.""

On impeachment, Priebus argued that the president should continue playing ""the victim card"" and attacking the way Democrats handled it -- something he described as a ""sham."" Impeachment, he predicted, could turn out to be a boon for Trump, especially since the Ukraine controversy implicated Biden."

But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall.

Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent. The populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid stood at 10 percent in the previous survey.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who stood at 12 percent in the July survey, saw her support drop in half and now comes in at 6 percent in the new poll.

Environmental and progressive advocate and former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer has the backing of 4 percent of likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 3 percent, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. The remaining nine candidates in the record-setting Democratic presidential field all register at 1 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Besides the topline findings, the poll also has warning signs for Biden among South Carolina’s black voters, who make up more than half of the likely Democratic primary electorate. The former vice president’s position as either a first- or second-choice candidate dropped by 10 points among black voters to 52 percent, while Warren’s position as a top-two choice contender jumped 11 points to 26 percent.

“Biden is still in a pretty good position in South Carolina, but there are some signs that he might not have a true firewall among black voters. If he does not do well in the earlier contests in February, there may be potential for current preferences to shift here,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted Oct. 16-21, with 402 South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

Robert Torricelli told “America’s Newsroom” Wednesday that nominating former Vice President Joe Biden as the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee would be problematic due to the lingering questions about his son's financial dealings with Ukraine and China.

“The problem Democrats are facing in this race is that if Joe Biden is the nominee, Hunter Biden becomes 'Hillary Clinton’s emails,'” Torricelli said, predicting that the side issue will dog his campaign as it did for the former secretary of state in 2016.

Torricelli’s comments came after a new CNN national poll showed Biden leading the field following a recent dip. According to the poll conducted by the market research firm SSRS, Biden has the support of 34 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his widest margin since his campaign officially launched on April 25.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren has 19 percent, with Sen. Bernie Sanders at 16 percent.

Host Bill Hemmer asked Torricelli if a similar case could be made about Warren's, D-Mass., far-left policy proposals. Torricelli argued that ""Hunter Biden’s consulting contracts in China"" are more problematic than Republicans accusing Warren of being a socialist.

Torricelli said he still views Warren as the front-runner and believes national poll numbers ""will correct themselves.""

""There is a Democratic core sympathy for Biden for what he has gone through that has boosted his numbers. This is still, in my opinion, an Elizabeth Warren race. She's the only one with the organization, she's got the money, she's got the message, she is focused,"" he said.

Last week, Hunter Biden broke his silence since his relationship with companies in Ukraine and China came under scrutiny.

In a nationally televised interview, Biden maintained he did nothing improper while he served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Biden, 49, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Biden said he did not discuss the Burisma Holdings board seat with his father, except for one ""brief exchange"" that was previously reported.

Hunter Biden announced previously he will be stepping down from the board of a Chinese equity fund and that he would not work for any foreign-owned companies if his father becomes president.

Clinton in recent weeks has privately stated she would enter the race if she were certain she could win, The New York Times reported Tuesday.

Clinton has also been publicly hinting at a possible White House run in 2020 and made reference to a possible rematch last week while appearing on ""PBS News Hour."" She claimed she could beat Trump ""again.""

""So maybe there does need to be a rematch,"" Clinton added. ""Obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don't understand, I don't think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.""

She replied to Trump's taunts on Twitter about her running again earlier this month and warned him not to ""tempt"" her.

Conservative commentator and Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro also raised the issue last week and said if Clinton had any desire to get in the race, now is the time.

""Honestly, if Hillary Clinton were to make her grand reentrance, now would be about the time she should do it,"" he said. ""Because the fact is, a lot of people are dissatisfied with [Joe] Biden. A lot of people are dissatisfied with [Elizabeth] Warren and Hillary is an enormous name.""

McEnany said the reports of Clinton considering another run show the weakness of the current field, which includes and ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden and ""radical socialism"" from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. She predicted that Warren will be the nominee and the race will be ""the case for socialism versus President Trump"" and his strong economic policies."

O'Grady and a panel of experts broke down some of the biggest proposals coming out of the current field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and how the ideas can be financed.

""Let's take Elizabeth Warren. She's promising $40 to $50 trillion in new spending over the next 10 years,"" said Brian Riedl, an economic policy expert and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ""Let's assume $30 trillion of that can't come from the rich.""

STUART VARNEY ON KEEPING HOME HEATING BILLS DOWN THIS WINTER

""According to the Congressional Budget Office,"" continued Riedl. ""In order to raise $30 trillion, you would need either a payroll tax of 33 percent on top of the current 15 percent payroll tax. You're looking at about a 48 percent total payroll tax.""

""Or you could do a value-added tax, which is essentially a national sales tax, which is the other way Europe funds their welfare states,"" he suggested. ""You would need a 78 percent national sales tax to fund a $30 trillion agenda.""

""Are you saying that the government would take almost half of the income that your employer gives you? They would take that out even before you see that paycheck?"" asked O'Grady.

""That's correct. It would go from 15.3, which it is today, to nearly 50 percent for a payroll tax. That means ... nearly half of your paycheck would be taken out in the payroll tax. And of the remaining half, you're still paying the income tax. And when you go shopping, you're going to be paying sales tax. If there's a VAT tax, you're paying that. The cumulative effect of these taxes would be absolutely enormous,"" said Riedl.

""You can't get the proponents of these policies to talk openly about the taxes they require,"" he said, ""because once the American people find out what they cost, once they find out that Medicare-for-all isn't a free lunch -- support is going to collapse.""

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE'LL FINANCES 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

""They do talk about it,"" said Fox Business Network host David Asman, ""but in the most dishonest way, I mean, it's like Liz Warren saying: 'Come on two pennies for a billionaire. What is two pennies?'""

Senator Warren's Democratic colleagues have called her out for not being fully transparent about the costs of the government programs that she is touting.

During the last Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar took Warren to task, saying: ""At least [Sen. Bernie Sanders is] being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan non-profit, tried estimating the revenue created by eliminating multiple deductions, doubling the corporate income tax rate to 42 percent (it was 35 percent before President Trump's tax cut), raising financial transaction taxes, and raising the top two individual income tax rates to 70 percent.

It found that doing so would only cover 40 percent of the 10-year cost of ""Medicare for All"" -- estimated at $30 trillion -- with roughly $11 trillion in raised revenue. If the next president relied on just income tax hikes, it would be ""impossible"" to fund the plan, even if the government took 100 percent of the rich's income.

The authors cautioned that their estimates were ""very rough"" and ""didn't account for many interactions and economic feedback.""

DNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR PRESSED ON HOW $34T 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN WILL BE PAID

The study came as several 2020 Democrats proposed a single-payer program like ""Medicare for All."" At the fourth Democratic debate in October, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was pressed on her continual refusal to state whether her plan would require middle-class tax cuts.

""Regardless of the overall impact of Medicare-for-All, it is clear that taxes on the middle class would have to rise in order to pay for it,"" the study read.

While Warren has been unclear about taxes, she's committed not to sign legislation that will raise costs for the middle class while lowering them for the wealthy. That's likely a reference to a net decrease that would purportedly result from lowering costs for health care in a greater amount than the increase in taxes.

Tuesday's study acknowledged that median costs would likely fall, although it's unclear whether total costs will increase or decrease.

""There is simply not enough available revenue from high earners and businesses to cover the full cost of eliminating premiums, ending all cost-sharing, and expanding coverage to all Americans and for (virtually) all health services,"" the study read. ""But in exchange, the absence of premiums and cost-sharing could represent a net gain or loss to individuals' finances depending on how much they currently pay, how much they currently make, and how the ultimate financing is structured.""

While it remains unclear how Warren will raise the necessary revenue, she pledged on Sunday to release a plan with more details."

Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" plan.

The Massachusetts Democrat and White House candidate said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ""What I see… is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of 'Medicare-for-all,' and specifically how we pay for it.""

Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ""Medicare-for-all"" plans at $32-34 trillion.

""It's mystifying that for someone who has put having a plan for everything at the center of her pitch to voters, Senator Warren has decided to release a health care plan only after enduring immense public pressure for refusing to do so,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said later.

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT REACHES NEW HIGH

Quinnipiac University: “Approval among American voters of the U.S. House impeachment inquiry, an inquiry to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against President Trump, has reached its highest level, as 55 percent approve of the inquiry, while 43 percent disapprove, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Last week, 51 percent of voters approved of the inquiry, while 45 percent disapproved. In today's poll, Democrats approve of the inquiry 93 - 7 percent and independent voters approve 58 - 37 percent, while Republicans disapprove of the inquiry 88 - 10 percent. … Nearly half of registered voters, 48 percent, say President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46 percent say he should not. Last week, 46 percent supported impeachment while 48 percent were opposed. In today's poll, support for impeachment is 86 - 9 percent among Democrats, and 49 - 41 percent among independents, while Republicans oppose impeachment 91 - 6 percent.”



Trump approval dropping - Quinnipiac University: “President Trump’s job approval rating has dipped below 40 percent for the first time since the impeachment inquiry began as 38 percent say they approve of the job he is doing, and 58 percent disapprove. Last week, 41 percent approved of the president’s job performance, while 54 percent disapproved. This is President Trump’s lowest net approval rating since a July 2018 poll. … Nancy Pelosi gets a mixed approval rating as 45 percent approve of the job she is doing as Speaker of the House, while 47 percent disapprove. Mitch McConnell’s approval rating is deep underwater as 57 percent of voters disapprove of the job he is doing as Senate Majority Leader, while only 24 percent approve.”



Top diplomat’s testimony rattles Congress - NYT: “[During] explosive testimony on Tuesday, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, laid out in visceral terms the stakes of what he saw as an illegitimate scheme to pressure the Kiev government for political help by suspending American security aid. In by far the most damning account yet to become public in the House impeachment inquiry Mr. Taylor described a president holding up $391 million in assistance for the clear purpose of forcing Ukraine to help incriminate Mr. Trump’s domestic rivals. Mr. Trump’s actions, he testified, undercut American allies desperately fighting off Russia’s attempt to redraw the boundaries of Europe through force.”



Trump defenders storm deposition, shut down probe in protest - WaPo: “A group of House Republicans temporarily shut down the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, barging into a secure room where a witness was set to testify and refusing to leave despite orders from top Democrats. A group of about two-dozen Trump allies stormed a room in the Capitol basement where three investigative committees were supposed to hear testimony from Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy. Those members were not on the committees of jurisdiction and were not supposed to be present during the closed-door deposition. A shouting match began between Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) and some Democrats in the room as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) left to consult with the sergeant at arms…”



Senate Republicans caution Trump on chaos - WashEx: “Senate Republicans are warning President Trump that he risks bungling impeachment politically and alienating voters, even as he survives a Senate trial, without a focused strategy prosecuted by competent political professionals. With House Democrats expected to approve articles of impeachment by Christmas, Senate Republicans are bracing for the trial, and they are imploring Trump to appreciate the gravity of the situation and prepare. Angry tweets and belligerent news conferences are not sufficient. The president is not in danger of losing anywhere near enough Republican support to be removed from office. But without an effective defense against the Democrats’ charges on the Senate floor, voters might conclude impeachment was justified and oust him in 2020.”



Biden called Clinton impeachment 'lynching' - Fox News: “Even as top Democrats rushed to condemn President Trump's comparison of their impeachment inquiry to a ‘lynching,’ footage and news reports have emerged showing several top Democrats referring matter-of-factly to Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings as a ‘lynching’ in 1998. Among those Democrats are two African-American representatives still serving in the House, as well as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and presidential contender Joe Biden. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., called Clinton's impeachment a ‘persecution’ and a ‘political lynching’ on the House floor in 1998. And Danny Davis, D-Ill., condemned what he described as a ‘lynching in the People's House.’ Biden, who has condemned Trump's remarks as ‘abhorrent’ and ‘despicable,’ said in 1998 that a Clinton impeachment could be perceived as a ‘partisan lynching.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS

“The language of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her constitution declares, ‘that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct; so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly.’” – James Madison, Federalist No. 47



TIME OUT: BETTER LATE THAN NEVER

Smithsonian: “Leonardo da Vinci wasn’t known for getting things done. He was often years or even decades late when delivering paintings, and many of the fantastical schemes he concocted… Still, new research conducted by engineers at MIT suggests one of the Renaissance giant’s unbuilt designs—a bridge poised to be the world’s longest—would have worked if the artist had actually followed through on his plans. Leonardo drafted his proposal in response to Sultan Bayezid II’s 1502 appeal for bridge designs. Bayezid, ruler of the Ottoman Empire, wanted to connect the cities of Constantinople and Galata, which were separated by a river estuary called the Golden Horn. … Bayezid was unimpressed by Leonardo’s complicated blueprints, and the bridge the artist envisioned was never built—at least until MIT engineer John Ochsendorf stepped in to test the 500-year-old design’s feasibility. …Ochsendorf and his colleagues analyzed materials available in 1502 and determined the Old Master would probably have used stone rather than wood or brick…”

BIDEN BOOMING

CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president has rebounded, and now stands at its widest margin since April, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%. … Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups’ Biden leads the President by 10 points…”



Still rolling in South Carolina - Monmouth University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner among likely Democratic voters in South Carolina. The Monmouth University Poll finds little has changed in overall presidential primary support, but there is evidence that black voters’ preference for the front-runner varies significantly when age and education are taken into account. Biden currently holds 33% support among South Carolina voters who are likely to vote in the February 2020 Democratic primary. … Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (16%) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (12%) are in the second tier of candidate preferences. … California Sen. Kamala Harris has 6% support… Tom Steyer (4%), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Video shows Warren waffling on Medicare - Mediaite: “Massachusetts Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren backed off of Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan in leaked video of a private meeting with union officials, saying ‘it’s not that I have a plan that says we’re going to do this part and then we’re going to do this part,’ but that ‘we’re going to get to a table like this.’ Warren has vacillated between being ‘with Bernie’ on his health care plan and considering it a mere ‘framework,’ and most recently told CNN’s David Axelrod that Bernie’s plan is ‘my plan.’ But Mediaite has obtained leaked video from an August 23 meeting with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union executive board in which Warren is considerably more vague about the plan.”



Massachusans like Warren, but not so much her health plan - WBUR: “In the race for her party's presidential nomination, home state U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has opened up a wide lead among likely Democratic primary voters in Massachusetts, according to a new WBUR poll. … But the WBUR poll also has a note of caution for Warren. Medicare for All … is less popular among likely Democratic voters in this blue state than a plan that would include a public option… According to the survey, Warren leads a crowded Democratic field, with 33% of likely voters in the primary supporting her. Former Vice President Joe Biden is second with 18%, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is at 13%, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is in fourth place with 7%. Fifteen percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their answer. While Warren probably benefits from home-field advantage, the poll is the latest in a series of recent surveys that show her moving to front-runner status.



HOW TEAM TRUMP MADE RALLIES DATA MINING MACHINES

WSJ: “The most transformational change has been turning rallies into large-scale data-mining operations. The Trump campaign has collected millions of phone numbers, email addresses and other personal information supporters hand over when signing up for text alerts or registering for rally tickets. The Trump team uses the data to reveal people’s political registrations and in which elections they have voted. Then the team cross-references that information with data on their consumer habits—already collected by the Republican Party—to forecast how likely each rallygoer is to vote in 2020 and which candidate the voter will probably support, campaign officials said. A yet-to-be released smartphone app will offer supporters certain perks, such as accelerated entry into rallies, in exchange for putting the campaign in contact with friends who might back the president and hand over personal data.”



Dem PAC spends big bashing Trump in key general election states - Axios: “A major outside Democratic group is outspending President Trump on Facebook ads in the crucial battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Why it matters: 2020 presidential candidates have spent at least $61 million so far this cycle on Facebook and Google ads, with Trump in the lead, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. But that's national spending. The state-by-state spend (below) is important because that's where the 2020 election will be won. … Meanwhile, Priorities USA — a major Democratic super PAC — launched a digital ad campaign in late July ‘focused on holding President Trump accountable’ and highlighting how his economic policies have negatively affected some Americans. The group spent $40 million online in 2016 and they said they plan to spend more than that in 2020.”



Dick’s CEO tries on the idea of a presidential run - Politico: “Ed Stack, the CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is testing the waters for a possible third-party presidential bid that could scramble the dynamics of the 2020 general election. Various messages were presented to a focus group in southern Wisconsin this week centering on the billionaire businessman, along with possible three-way match-ups against Donald Trump and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. The focus group, according to a source who took part in the testing, ran through varying themes involving Stack and heavily focused on his example of ‘showing leadership’ by halting the sale of assault-style rifles at all of Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in the wake of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida.”



GOP HOLDS NARROW EDGE FOR MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR

Mississippi Clarion Ledger: “A new poll shows the Mississippi gubernatorial race remains tight with less than two weeks to Election Day. It also found a majority of voters oppose impeaching and removing President Donald Trump from office. … Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves leading Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood 46% to 43%. 2% support third-party candidates Bob Hickingbottom or Dave Singletary … Other recent polls have shown a similarly competitive race, closer than any state governor contest since 2003. Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2004. Mason-Dixon pollsters indicated Trump's scheduled Nov. 1 rally in Tupelo ‘could be a deciding factor’ and offer a ‘significant boost’ for Reeves with GOP turnout. They noted Trump's last-minute campaigning in Louisiana recently helped force incumbent Democrat John Bel Edwards into a runoff.”

“As American people, we do a lot of business in China. And they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values in America is free speech.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I’m at the point where I may hibernate this winter and avoid at all costs any media news. There are so many things I find biased, crooked and overblown, most of all the vendetta against the president. I resent the focus on this as opposed to a new trade policy, immigration reform, poor reports on education in the US, drugs and so many urgent items. Trump wasn’t my first choice for president in 2016, but I supported him when nominated. I don’t care nearly as much about his horrible personality as I do about his policies and the things he’s accomplished. … The polls say ‘Impeach! Elect Socialists! Elect people who are not only corrupt but suffering from delusions or dementia.’ I’m old, cranky and tired of the idiocy. Boo hiss.” – Susan Williams, St. Louis

“Something that is not talked about is, if college tuition became free in the United States is it reasonable for a college student to believe they can choose their college and/or major? One of the casualties of big socialized governments is there is no mechanism to afford personal individuality, uniqueness or desire. Everyone is treated the same. It then seems a reasonable conclusion that all students who want free college tuition to be tested, the government decide what the student demonstrates high aptitude in and the government choses the school and/or major for that student. This would be based on how the government decides the student can best serve the masses, not the individual student’s desires. In the United States we generally believe in mutually beneficial transactions. Meaning, both parties to a transaction receive something. One party receives the quantity and quality of a good or service, the other receives money. Both parties win. It would be a sea change to believe the student would receive both; free education and the choice of where to go and what to major in.” – Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.



[Ed. note: Well, we do already kind of dabble in that. The federal government provides special incentives for students to choose certain disciplines and for institutions to choose certain types of students – directing research funds to preferred research, creating incentives for encouraging women into STEM, etc. But I take your larger point. If a four-year college degree becomes like high school is now, i.e. a guaranteed good available to all residents, one imagines that the government will take a similarly strong interest in what colleges teach and what students will earn. We have already seen it through the pressures applied to schools via Pell Grants and other forms of funding. But leaving aside the consideration of funding, which is a lulu, the main concern about universal college is that it will diminish the value of college for those who do attend. One of the reasons college has been such a great ladder into the middle class is that it isn’t for everyone. About a third of Americans over 25 have at least a four-year degree. But for Americans over 65, it’s only about a quarter of the population. It stands to reason that new graduates holding college degrees 40 years ago were more valuable than those today. What happens if we see college-going rates soar to 60 percent or more? There are lots of good things about higher education (and plenty of bad things, too). But many of the good things are not about what happens in the classroom – socialization, training in independent living in a controlled atmosphere, a sense of cultural belonging. Those things may or may not be degraded in a world of universal college. But the value of a degree, and thereby its utility for upward socioeconomic mobility, certainly would.]

Bloomberg: “America is sitting on a mountain of uneaten bacon. More than 40 million pounds (18,000 metric tons) of pork bellies, the cut used for bacon making, were sitting in refrigerated warehouses as of Sept. 30, according to U.S. government data released Tuesday. That’s the most for the month since 1971. The overhang came after a buildup in the American hog herd. Pork output surged over the summer months and through September, said Dennis Smith, senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. Bellies have seen a magnified inventory increase because demand is mostly domestic, unlike cuts such as ham, for which overseas buying can help reduce reserves.”

“The best thing that’s happened to the party, and I would say one of the best things Donald Trump ever did, was he put an end to the Clinton dynasty.

After all, the president is also struggling in the polls, battling his own party on Syria, and had to reverse himself on hosting the G-7 at his Florida resort.

But no, the Dems are nervous. So nervous, in fact, that they’re engaged in their quadrennial ritual of fantasizing.

MICK MULVANEY STRUGGLES AS WHITE HOUSE LEAKS SAY HIS JOB IS IN JEOPARDY

What superhero is ready to don a cape, swoop in to rescue them and capture the White House?

The media love such fantasies, of course, because it’s an exciting story line and the chance to pump up a new personality.

Remember when Oprah made a few comments and the press was seized by the idea that she could be president? The only problem was, well, she didn’t want to be president.

Now comes a New York Times report that Democratic donors and insiders are “fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute.”

The reason, obviously, is a lack of confidence that any of the current field can defeat Donald Trump—who, even after a likely impeachment vote, is virtually certain to survive a trial in the Republican Senate.

The current polls show several Democratic candidates besting Trump, but that could look very different in the fall of 2020 after the nominee is battered by zillions in Republican advertising along with Trumpian attacks.

Joe Biden probably has the best chance to oust Trump, but there is rising concern that his uneven debate performances and anemic fundraising may sink his primary campaign. Biden could have dominated as the target of Trump’s Ukraine efforts, in my view, but he has still not done an interview since impeachment exploded.

Elizabeth Warren is viewed by the prognosticators as having the best shot at the nomination, but there is growing fear that she’s too far left to win a general election. Even as she’s taking a second look at Medicare for All, having ducked questions that it would force a middle-class tax hike, Warren is saddled with other positions that delight Democrats but could be viewed as socialistic in a general election.

If you assume that Bernie Sanders can’t win as a 78-year-old heart attack survivor, that leaves two moderate alternatives to Biden.

Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both had strong debate outings last week, and Mayor Pete has surged into third place in the latest Iowa poll. But neither seems a surefire bet to beat Trump. And thanks to Nancy Pelosi, both are getting far less media oxygen because of the overwhelming focus on impeachment.

So who do the Democratic dreamers want?

The Times says Sherrod Brown is getting a lot of calls (his wife confirms this). But if the Ohio senator thought he could win the nomination, he would already be in the race.

Eric Holder is toying with the idea of getting in. But Barack Obama’s attorney general has never won an election.

Mike Bloomberg? He was a very good New York mayor, but he threatens to run every four years and never does. He wound up deferring to Biden this time. He’s 77. Not happening.

Hillary? You know she’s thought about it. But she also knows she’s had her shot.

(Update: Oops! The Washington Post follows up today, saying: ""Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction."")

Michelle Obama? I’m sure she’d look good in Democratic polls. One unnamed person “mused” about her to the Times. She was a popular first lady. But unlike Hillary, Michelle has never exhibited the urge to be a politician herself. I have the sense that she devoted eight years to public service and is happy to have her life back.

Late entries can kick up a fuss, but they never win, not after the current candidates have raised millions, set up organizations and developed their ground games.

So this is really about a collective unease that Biden won’t win the nomination and that Warren might.

It’s like a fantasy football league, lots of fun to play and game out the possibilities. But this is a contest you only win with flesh-and-blood players on the field."

But at least one family member who lost a loved one in the bloody massacre – in which a gunman killed 20 children and six adults – claims Biden is distorting the facts.

""The issue of gun violence has been a concern of mine for a long, long time,"" Biden says in the video. ""What really got to me though, really firsthand, was what happened up at Sandy Hook.

""I think I met with every one of the parents,"" he continues, ""and ... the families of those who were lost.""

But JT Lewis, 19, whose brother Jesse, 6, was killed in the attack, which happened just 11 days before Christmas, says former President Obama met with each of the grieving families after the Newtown shooting — not Biden.

SANDY HOOK FATHER AWARDED $450,000 IN DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR

“This is a lie,” Lewis writes in a Twitter message about Biden’s claim. “Obama came to Sandy Hook and met with every family. Joe Biden DID NOT.

“In fact,” Lewis adds, “my family was not allowed on Air Force One because we refused to support Obama/Biden gun control efforts.”

Biden addressed Sandy Hook family members June 15, 2016, CBS News reported, but it was unclear whether all families were represented.

In another post, Lewis reminds his followers of another instance in which Biden got his facts wrong regarding a school shooting.

He refers to an incident from August of this year, when Biden claimed to have been vice president at the time of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.

But the Parkland shooting happened in February 2018, more than a year after Biden had left the vice presidency.

“@JoeBiden is either a liar or he’s losing his mind,” Lewis concludes.

Gaffes have been one area of concern for the Biden campaign, which has been losing momentum in recent weeks. Other topics that have some supporters worried include increased scrutiny of Ukraine business dealings that involved Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.

The story -- titled “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’” -- said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against President Trump, citing Biden’s lackluster debate performance in Ohio last week.

They also raised concerns about the former vice president's fundraising struggles and his need to defend his family’s business dealings in Ukraine amid the ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported that Clinton was considering a 2020 rematch against Trump after the State Department concluded this week there was ""no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information"" regarding Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.

Kilmeade said traditional Democrats are concerned that proposing free health care for illegal immigrants, potentially taking away private insurance in favor of a ""Medicare-for-all system"" and imposing a Green New Deal on the energy industry will not appeal to voters in the middle.

Weld, who was 2016 Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson's running mate, told Neil Cavuto Wednesday on ""Your World"" he is also seeing electoral headway in New Hampshire ahead of that state's 2020 primary.

""I think the president is too out of control for this country,"" he said.

""Things are moving in New Hampshire. I came up 28 points against the president in a head-to-head in the last 30 days... The president doesn't help himself when he goes three-for-three on making America look like an unreliable ally.""

BILL WELD 'THRILLED' OTHER REPUBLICANS ARE CHALLENGING TRUMP IN PRIMARY

In that regard, Weld claimed Trump has weakened America's standing in the world through his treatment of the Kurds in the Middle East, Ukraine, and most recently Iran.

Weld claimed the president is ""begging"" to get back to the negotiating table with Tehran.

He later laughed heartily when Cavuto asked about the president's recent tweets -- one of which claimed Republicans who don't support him are ""human scum,"" and another that labeled frequent critic Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a ""pompous ass.""

""I think that he just is so unreliable and just can't stick to a story, and particularly not a true story,"" he said.

Regarding his primary battle with Trump, Weld said he is honing in on both New Hampshire and Super Tuesday states.

He rejected the claim his candidacy could be seen as hurting the Republican Party.

""They say everyone's got to be loyal and rally around the flag [but] too often, particularly in Washington, D.C., loyalty is nothing but an excuse for doing the wrong thing,"" he said.

He called progressive Democratic presidential hopefuls Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ""not currently electable in the United States,"" but added Trump's reelection would be ""perhaps a bigger risk than those two Democrats -- who would not be able to get anything through Congress.""

During the interview, Weld and Cavuto also discussed whether his focus on New Hampshire has parallels to then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy's, D-Minn., surprise primary performance there in 1968 -- which lead incumbent President Lyndon Johnson to later drop out of the race. The 1968 Democratic nomination eventually went to Johnson's vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey.

And the tech entrepreneur and 2020 longshot, who has seen his campaign soar in recent months, said that if he doesn’t win the Democratic nomination, he’d “be open to” serving as running mate.

CLINTON-GABBARD CLASH RAISES ROLE ABOUT 2016 NOMINEE'S ROLE IN 2020 RACE

Yang made his comments while taking questions from reporters Tuesday evening in Hollis, N.H., and Wednesday morning after headlining ‘Politics and Eggs,’ a must stop for White House hopefuls campaigning in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state.

His swing through the Granite State comes days after Clinton firmly inserted herself into the 2020 campaign – arguing without evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a “Russian asset,” and mocking President Trump’s direct interactions with foreign leaders.

Gabbard, in a blistering video released over the weekend, suggested that Clinton had “smeared” her as payback for the Hawaii congresswoman’s endorsement of Sanders in the marathon 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle.

The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee has remained in the spotlight after winning the 2016 national popular vote but losing the election and the White House to Trump. And she’s served as a longtime foil for Republicans.

But her comments and actions in recent days have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level – renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has ambitions to mount a third bid for president.

Yang said that “nominees of the party from past cycles remain very important figures in the party, in that Hillary would have a lot of value to add.”

But he then emphasized that “she's not a candidate and it strikes me as a little bit inappropriate for her to be commenting directly about candidates since we're all Democrats. And you think that she’d be neutral unless she decided to endorse a particular candidate.”

WARREN SAYS SHE'LL SOON RELEASE PLAN ON HOW TO PAY FOR HER MEDICARE FOR ALL PROPOSAL

On health care, Yang announced that “we’re going to release a detailed health care plan in the days ahead.”

And specifically on the ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal introduced in the Senate by Sanders and backed by Warren, Yang said: “I support the spirit of what Bernie is trying to accomplish. I do think that outlawing private insurance in a very short period of time is a bit too disruptive, and I would not do it.”

He reiterated that “I've been on the record for a long time saying that there would be a role for some private insurers in my plan. I think most private insurers will disappear if we do a good enough job with the public plan, but that there would be some companies that genuinely do add value and adapt to the new circumstances.”

As Yang arrived in New Hampshire, his staff in the state was in the process of expanding. Yang’s team in the crucial early-voting state stood at around 15 at the beginning of the month, but a senior adviser told Fox News they planned to add at least 10 new hires by the end of October or early November.

Yang’s campaign has been fueled by his unconventional style and his push for what he calls the ‘Freedom Dividend,’ a universal basic income system that would pay all adult Americans $1,000 per month. The plan would help Americans cope with the loss of jobs due to the increased impact of automation and artificial intelligence.

Asked if he’d be open to serving as the Democratic Party’s running mate if he fails to win the nomination, Yang told Fox News “my goal is to solve the problems of the 21st century. I believe the best way I can do that is as president. But if it's in some other capacity, I'd be open to that. The goal is really just to make sure that this country is in a condition that I'm proud to pass along to my kids.”

Yang, along with many other of the Democratic presidential candidates, has disavowed outside super PACs as he pledges to combat the influence of dark money in politics. But a new group – called the Math PAC – has vowed to raise and spend at least $1 million in support of Yang’s campaign.

Yang told Fox News and CBS News that “I know very little about the Math PAC, genuinely.”

“I'm not going to try and dissuade them, because we have the rules that we have. After I'm president, I'm very happy to repeal Citizens United and try and do away with super PACs entirely. But given the rules that we have right now, my goal is to compete and to win and so I'm not going to dissuade private citizens from trying to help,” he added.

Yang’s come a long way since the early days of his campaign, when the outsider and first-time candidate was the longest of long shots. He said he now feels like he’s being taken seriously by the Democratic establishment

“I've been thrilled by the momentum that the campaign has gotten; certainly we might have started as something of a newcomer/outsider, but I feel like I'm becoming more and more part of the establishment, as we get more support,” he noted.

But there continue to be moments when the candidate – who’s qualified for all of the presidential primary debates to date – is snubbed by the mainstream media.

His supporters, known as the Yang Gang, have started a trending hashtag on Twitter dubbing what they are calling unfair coverage of the candidate a #YangMediaBlackout. The latest example they cite is The Weather Channel, which did not invite Yang to participate in their climate change special set to air Nov. 7.

“Another mystery, given that by any objective standard, I am either fourth, fifth or sixth in this race. And so why would you invite, I believe, nine candidates or ten candidates and not invite Andrew Yang? I do not know. I have a very extensive climate change plan. I like the Weather Channel just as much as the next American,” Yang told Fox News when asked about the lack of an invite."

Trump flaunted his actions to bolster the oil and gas industries in the country – including approving some controversial pipelines, pulling out of Paris Climate Accord and abandoning former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan – while slamming Democrats for putting the fossil fuel industry ""under assault,"" as he put it.

""Our natural resources don’t belong to the government, they belong to the people,"" Trump said during the speech at the Shale Insight Conference. ""We've ended the war on American energy and we’ve ended the assault on American energy workers.""

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES TOWARD NATIONAL FUEL ECONOMY STANDARD, PREPARES FOR LEGAL BATTLE WITH CALIFORNIA

The president’s speech, in front of an audience comprised heavily of blue-collar workers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, marked the second time in three months he has traveled to the Keystone State. Pennsylvania, which Trump narrowly won in 2016, would be a crucial state to win in the next presidential election; Trump apparently has seen his pro-industry policies as a path toward winning it, and his reelection, once again.

The president railed against a ban on fracking – which had the support of many Democrats seeking to unseat him in 2020 – arguing that the controversial method of extracting natural gas brought wealth to rural and downtrodden areas and will create a boom in construction jobs throughout the state.

""My job is to represent to people of Pittsburgh, not the people of Paris,"" Trump said, resurfacing a line he used previously.

The politics surrounding the oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania, however, has not been as clean as Trump said the pipelines will be.

In the suburbs that might be key to his path to victory, Pennsylvania voters have shown a growing opposition to the drilling and massive pipelines required to move its product across the state. Candidates in state and local races increasingly have been hardening their stances on the industry. National polling showed growing skepticism of fracking, the process used in extraction.

While the issue is unlikely to have a game-changing effect on the race already dominated by Trump's strong personality, a looming impeachment fight and accusations of racism, Trump's eagerness to promote the industry underscored his tight focus on shoring up his base of rural voters, even at the risk of alienating others.

""Today, I'm proud to declare that I've delivered on every single promise I made to this conference three years ago and much, much more,"" Trump said.

Several Democrats seeking the White House have taken their own political risks on the issue. Backed by environmentalists on the left, soe candidates— including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — have broken from the party's past support for fracking to call for a nationwide ban. More centrist candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have declined to go that far.

Biden, who also was in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, openly criticized Trump, saying the policies he espoused hurt those very same blue-collar workers the president was courting later in the day.

Biden cast the wealthy president as a charlatan populist whose tax policies, economic stewardship and overall erratic leadership style has hurt U.S. workers.

""This administration has no idea what hard-working, decent, ordinary Americans are going through,"" Biden said during a speech in his hometown of Scranton.

Biden has argued that he could reassemble Obama's winning coalition by winning back some working-class white voters who sided with Trump while reversing Democrats' decline from 2012 among nonwhite voters in cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee.

HILLARY CLINTON BACKS OUT OF DC EVENT ALSO SET TO INCLUDE TULSI GABBARD, KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: REPORT

Clinton in recent weeks has privately stated she would enter the 2020 presidential race if she were certain she could win, The New York Times reported Tuesday. The story, titled “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’,” said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against Trump, citing Biden’s lackluster debate performance in Ohio last week.

They also raised concerns about Biden's fundraising struggles and his need to defend his family’s business dealings in Ukraine amid the ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry.

They also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were likely too liberal to win the general election.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported that Clinton was considering a 2020 rematch against Trump after the State Department concluded this week there was ""no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information"" regarding Clinton's use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.

The same State Department report, however, found dozens of individuals were at fault for mishandling classified information and found hundreds of security violations during her 2009-2013 tenure.

Clinton, the first woman to win a major party presidential nomination – and the national popular vote leader with almost 3 million more votes than Trump – remains a popular figure in her party, even after enduring criticism for losing key Midwestern states in 2016. For Republicans, she's a perennial target — currently in the Mississippi governor's race, where Democratic nominee Jim Hood, a longtime attorney general, is being attacked for acknowledging he voted for her over Trump.

Clinton’s supporters within the Democratic establishment have also passed around an op-ed published earlier this month in the San Francisco Chronicle by former Mayor Willie Brown titled: “Who should run against Trump? How about Hillary Clinton?” The Washington Post reported.

Both the Post and the Times reported that Clinton was not the only possible last-minute candidate on Democrats’ minds. Also being considered were: former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Disney chief executive Bob Iger, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and former first lady Michelle Obama.

The independent senator and 2020 presidential primary contender announced on Thursday his plan to legalize marijuana by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House.

Sanders, whose home state of Vermont in 2018 legalized possession of one ounce of pot and let each adult resident grow two plants for personal use, has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide. He’s argued that the criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.

“Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Along with legalizing marijuana nationwide, Sanders also proposed expunging all past marijuana-related convictions and funneling some of the revenue from the legal marijuana business into communities hardest hit by the so-called War on Drugs.

“When we talk about criminal justice reform and ending institutional racism in America, we are talking about ending the disastrous War on Drugs, which has disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans,” his campaign said in a statement.

“It is time to admit the criminalization of marijuana was a disaster, especially for communities of color, and allow those most impacted to move forward with their lives. Our job now is to legalize marijuana and vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions, and ensure that revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in communities hit hardest by the War on Drugs.”

Legalizing marijuana has gone from a once-fringe issue to a mainstream topic of debate as more states have let residents buy and grow pot.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, while there are only nine states in the nation where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent poll from Gallup found that 66 percent of Americans supported fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.

The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.

While Sanders was the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates and senators such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records.

The only major candidates who haven’t supported full legalization: former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Biden said he supported decriminalization and rescheduling, criminal-record expungement and increased research access to marijuana, but argued it should be up to states to decide whether to legalize the drug. Klobuchar has said she supported decriminalization and legalization, but so far has not gone into specifics on her stance."

Maddow will be joined by MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker and Washington Post White House reporter Ashley Parker, an all-woman panel of moderators, the network said.

NBC raised eyebrows for including Maddow, who drew ratings for its cable network for pushing what critics have described as ""conspiracy theories"" during the two-year Russia investigation, as a debate moderator earlier this year as such a position is usually assigned to serious, unbiased journalists.

Maddow's debate performance was widely criticized for keeping much of her focus on the findings of then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Others slammed the ""conspiracy theorist"" on social media, saying her presence at a presidential debate was a ""disgrace.""

NBC has been under fire in recent weeks in the wake of the reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, who detailed the network's efforts to kill his Harvey Weinstein story and the alleged yearslong misconduct from its former star anchor Matt Lauer.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM'S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

Last week, a prominent women’s group called on the Democratic National Committee to pull its upcoming debate from MSNBC unless NBC News ""cleans house"" and launches an independent investigation into ""allegations of a culture of sexual abuse"" at the network.

UltraViolet Action, a leading national women’s organization, claimed the Democrats' fifth presidential debate shouldn’t happen if NBC didn't ditch its beleaguered leadership.

""The DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,"" UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement.

On Wednesday, a group of activists and sexual assault survivors from the organization held a protest outside NBC News' New York City headquarters.

The group called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and ""every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors"" at the Peacock Network.

""It's not just a Matt Lauer problem. It's a company-wide problem, and it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,"" Thomas said outside NBC’s famed 30 Rock.

WHAT WILL WE MAKE OF OUR MOMENT?

Periods of political upheaval can be wonderful things. Needed changes once deemed politically impossible suddenly become realities. Old superstitions and their totems can finally be discarded.



But it’s never all good.



The tumult of the first half of the 1970s is instructive. After that period, which included the resignations of the vice president and then president over corruption and abuses of power, Washington ushered in much-needed ethics reforms. Congress cracked down on payola for members and mandated financial disclosure for itself and the other two branches.



But that same era resulted in the birth of the modern political primary system that wreaks increasing damage on the republic cycle after cycle. Getting rid of smoke-filled rooms may have decreased the power of party bosses, but has introduced more demagoguery – both fanatical and fantastical – to our public life.



Like last-call shots of Fireball, microwave burritos and men in skinny jeans, it sounded like a good idea at the time.



As the parties clash this time in Washington, we don’t know what the era to come will bring. Which will be the positive changes to laws and attitudes born from this era of political chaos unseen four decades? Which will be ones that linger like a Fireball hangover?



With this in mind, consider the offering from today’s WaPo: “The Constitution isn’t the cure for President Trump. It is the cause.” by Shira Lurie, a history professor at the University of Toronto who formerly taught at the University of Virginia.



We encourage you to read her piece to get a fuller understanding of the argument, but her basic effort is to caution those involved in the struggle to either oust or constrain President Trump by constitutional means are simultaneously deepening our esteem for our flawed founding charter.



“Democrats can and should seek a constitutional remedy to remove Trump,” she writes. “But we need to confront the idea that a president who lost the popular vote by millions, deceives the public, attacks the press and does not have the confidence of the majority of Americans may not be a distortion of the constitutional order, but a feature.”



We wondered whether to even call attention to the piece lest we be guilty of that version of straw man argument that The Dispatch’s David French has delightfully dubbed “nut picking.” That’s when you find a fringe character from an opposing point of view and drag them forward to suggest that some far-flung idea is really mainstream.



Lurie is not in the political mainstream. In fact, she acknowledges it by expressing concern that Democrats are expressing excessive reverence for the Constitution.



“Worshiping the Constitution as a sacred text is not patriotism, it’s fanaticism,” she warns. “We can continue to pray to it, but it won’t save us. It is high time to address the anti-democratic foundations of American government.”



But we fear that the bipartisan reverence for our founding is actually pretty surficial these days. Leaders in both parties are closer to Lurie than she knows.



When the executive branch shows absolute contempt for the clearly stated powers of the legislative branch in a letter that sounds like it was dictated by Huey Long from a balcony you don’t get that good ol’ separation-of-powers tingle.



When Democratic presidential candidates willy-nilly offer proposals that ignore not only those same separations but doing so using the kind of cheap demagoguery that defies the principles of both the Constitution and the Declaration, one doesn’t feel the gentle breezes of a return to Madisonian democracy.



Our era will produce substantial change for the generations to come. Whatever shape that takes, we would do better to avoid the mistakes of the past and use our era to strengthen, not diminish, the Constitution that has seen us through this and all of our previous crises.

TIME OUT: DEMOCRATIC DUNGAREES

Atlantic: “If you want to sell clothes in America, it helps a lot if buyers think your product is cool. Jeans have a backstory that any marketer would kill for. ‘Denim first became popular in the 1920s and 1930s in tandem with the rise of Hollywood,’ explains Emma McClendon, an associate curator at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who orchestrated a denim retrospective at the museum in 2015. … Over the years, the cuts and washes changed, but denim’s position as a relatively democratic element of the wardrobes of stylish, influential people didn’t. … In the past, only one or two styles of jeans were “cool” at a given time. … Now denim inventory is as infinite as the internet itself. Fast-fashion retailers update their selections constantly, which means that nearly every type of denim is available simultaneously. Depending on whom you ask, the big thing right now might be mom jeans.”

GRAHAM SET TO SQUEEZE FELLOW GOPERS WITH SHOW VOTE

AP: “GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President Donald Trump, is introducing a resolution condemning the Democratic-controlled House for pursuing a ‘closed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry.’ Graham announced the move Thursday and says the Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, is a co-sponsor. Graham plans a Thursday afternoon news conference. The nonbinding resolution gives Senate Republicans a chance to show support for Trump at a moment when Trump is urging his GOP allies to get tougher and fight harder for him as the House impeachment probe gathers momentum. Many Senate Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach amid the House impeachment inquiry. Rather than commenting on the substance of the probe, they are united in complaining that the House is taking depositions from witnesses behind closed doors.”



Some senators are keeping impeachment thoughts to themselves - Politico: “[Susan Collins] is among a group of senators from both parties who are increasingly citing their role as possible jurors in an impeachment trial. They argue that as impartial jurors, they shouldn't make any foregone conclusion — especially about a scandal that could force Trump out of office. … Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee agrees, saying jurors shouldn’t be ‘running around announcing their decision until they’ve heard the arguments.’ … The reserved nature of Republicans like Alexander, who is retiring, and the moderate Collins suggests some in the president's own party are legitimately open to Democrats' arguments — an ominous sign for Trump… It also has the added side benefit of excusing senators from the noisy, day-to-day chaos of the president’s investigation by Congress.”



Dems prepare to go public with probe - WaPo: “House Democrats are preparing to move their largely private impeachment inquiry onto a more public stage as soon as mid-November and are already grappling with how best to present the complex Ukraine saga to the American people. Over the past three weeks, a parade of current and former Trump administration officials have testified behind closed doors, providing House investigators with a compelling narrative of President Trump’s campaign to extract political favors from Ukrainian officials. … Among the witnesses Democrats hope to question in open session are the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., and his predecessor, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Both are seasoned diplomats who, in earlier House testimony, effectively conveyed outrage over a White House plan to withhold much-needed military aid from Ukraine…”



Wisconsin sees increase in support for impeachment - Marquette University: “A new Marquette Law School poll of Wisconsin registered voters finds that 46 percent think that there is enough cause now for Congress to hold hearings on impeachment of President Donald Trump, while 49 percent say there is not enough cause and 5 percent say they do not know. In April 2019, 29 percent said there was sufficient reason for impeachment hearings and 65 percent said there was not. The April poll was completed after Attorney General William Barr’s letter describing the Mueller report but before the report was publicly released. Earlier, in January 2019, 33 percent supported and 59 percent opposed hearings.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Loyalty to the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano questions President Trump’s relationship to upholding the Constitution: “After a weekend of torrential criticism, Trump announced that he had changed his mind and said he would not host the G-7 meeting at the Miami area resort. Yet, in the process of doing so, he characterized the Emoluments Clause as ‘phony.’ Who knows what he meant by phony? The clause is in the Constitution and it means what it says. Yet, whatever Trump meant by phony, it constituted at least a disparagement of the Constitution he has sworn to uphold and at worst a threat to ignore clauses he can disparage. This is most unusual and potentially dangerous, and it raises the question: Can the president lawfully enforce only the clauses of the Constitution with which he agrees and ignore those with which he disagrees? In a word: No.” More here.



Q POLL: WARREN AHEAD, BUT WORRIES ABOUT ELECTABILITY

Quinnipiac University: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has opened up a lead in the Democratic primary race after being locked in a tight race with former Vice President Joe Biden for several weeks, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 28 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 15 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 10 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris is at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar is at 3 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. … Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election… In today's poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll… Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent.”



Biden really slipping in fundraising pack - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is drawing more support from big-ticket donors than any other candidate in the race — yet he still can’t match his rivals’ cash flow. Biden has raised $20.7 million from contributions of at least $500 — $1.5 million more than his nearest competitor, despite entering the race later than all of them — thanks to the former vice president’s strong connections and goodwill among the traditional donors who have long financed the Democratic Party. … But it’s been nowhere near enough to make Biden the leader of the fundraising pack. In fact, his big-dollar dominance, and his reliance on those donors, is more evidence of how quickly small-dollar donations have become the most important component of political fundraising in a sprawling, fractured Democratic race. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are all outraising Biden, and stockpiling cash significantly faster than him, on the back of major support from online donors that Biden has been unable to build.”



Tim Ryan bows out - NBC News: “Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, ended his long-shot presidential campaign after months of struggling to find a footing in the crowded Democratic field. Ryan announced his decision to end his campaign in a video to supporters, stating he would run again for his House seat. He isn’t throwing his support behind anyone in the 2020 field at this time, his campaign told NBC. ‘I got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country: the workers who have been left behind, the businesses who have been left behind, the people who need health care or aren’t getting a quality education, or are saddled by tremendous debt,’ Ryan said. 'I'm proud of this campaign because I believe we’ve done that. We’ve given voice to the forgotten communities and the forgotten people in the United States.'""



Moderators announced for November debate - NBC News: “The fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia will have four moderators, MSNBC announced on Wednesday — and all of them are women. Moderating the Nov. 20 event, which is being co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will be Rachel Maddow, host of ‘The Rachel Maddow Show’ on MSNBC; Andrea Mitchell, host of ‘Andrea Mitchell Reports’ on MSNBC and NBC News' chief foreign affairs correspondent; Kristen Welker, NBC News' White House correspondent; and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. The debate will likely feature a smaller lineup of candidates than the dozen who qualified for October's debate in Ohio — only eight candidates have qualified for the debate stage so far, according to an unofficial NBC News tally. It will also be shorter than the three-hour October debate — it's scheduled to air from 9 to 11 p.m. ET.”



BORIS JOHNSON LAUNCHES BID FOR DECEMBER ELECTION

Fox News: “Boris Johnson will launch an attempt to hold a general election in Britain on December 12 to ‘get Brexit done.’ The British prime minister will attempt to convince members of Parliament to formally back the bid on Monday, but he will need the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons. Britain's next scheduled election is not until 2022. Johnson's move comes after his Brexit bill was finally passed earlier this week, but lawmakers defeated his request to push through the legislation in a three-day timetable, saying it didn't provide enough time for scrutiny. He said he expected the European Union to grant an extension to his October 31 deadline, likely to be to the end of January. The EU is expected to give its verdict on an extension on Friday. The prime minister said the Dec. 12 date will give lawmakers time before the election to scrutinize his Brexit bill. Under his plan, Parliament would remain working until Nov. 6, when campaigning would start.”

AUDIBLE: AMEN

“Back in 2015, his city roiled by unrest, by day the congressman was here in the Capitol working and leading in these hallways of power. But every night he rode the train back home and walked the neighborhoods, bullhorn in hand, encouraging unity and peace. Here’s what he said: ‘Let’s go home. Let’s all go home.’ Now our distinguished colleague truly has gone home, home to his Father’s house.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in his condolences for Rep. Elijah Cummings as he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol Thursday.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Without asking you to necessarily weigh in on the ‘wisdom’ of same (unless of course you want to), I have two ‘technical’ and hypothetical impeachment questions: If a president is impeached and IS convicted in the Senate, is he/she eligible to run for re-election? (Somewhat similar situation to Marion Barry in Washington, D.C.) If a president is impeached but is NOT convicted in the Senate, could the House vote to re-impeach the president the next day (perhaps even ad infinitum) in a political ground hog day?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: Most certainly, Mr. Wittnebert. President Trump could be removed from office and seek the presidency a second time, and he could be acquitted in the Senate and be re-impeached. But you’d have to think either scenario would be vanishingly rare. We talk often about impeachment being a political, not legal proposition. But that applies to its aftermath, too. If Trump becomes such a boat anchor that Senate Republicans feel obliged to cut ties with him, it will be because he is too great a political liability/embarrassment. If he is let off by the Senate, House Democrats will move urgently to pivot away from what will almost certainly be a somewhat embarrassing anti-climax.]



“I'm doing a bit of head scratching over what I see as competing information. By this I mean that I'm seeing President Trump's approval rating on a swift downhill slide and at the same time I'm hearing that the Democrats are hand-wringing over whether they have a candidate that can defeat him in 2020. Who needs to be more concerned?” – Neil Klapthor, Evans, Ga.



[Ed. note: The one who’s trailing a year from today! I kid, I kid… mostly. The past three weeks have been brutal for Trump, partly because of Democrats’ closing ranks and prosecuting their impeachment with vigorous determination. But it’s mostly been self-inflicted. Will the trend continue? Almost certainly not. It may get worse for the incumbent over time if further revelations drive a wedge between Trump and the GOP or it may get worse for Democrats because their own penchant for infighting will re-emerge. I suspect it will probably be quite a bit of both. But there are other considerations, particularly the health of the economy in the first two quarters of 2020. Given how much farther this river runs, it’s probably best to sail with the current for now and enjoy the view. We won’t find out who’s going over Niagara for a while yet.]

A PUMPKIN SPICE FLOAT

WTVC: “Around this time of year, most people take to carving pumpkins. But a farmer in Cleveland, Tennessee took things one step further. Justin Ownby grew a massive pumpkin that weighed 910 pounds… But he was not satisfied merely by its ornamental delights that enhance the season. Ownby's wife Christin Ownby shared video with WTVC that shows Ownby hollowed out the pumpkin, and converted to a buoyant watercraft that he tested on his farm's pond. A second video has someone off camera asking him to do his impression of ‘Washington crossing the Delaware!,’ and Ownby stands up as the pumpkin submerges under the sudden weight. Ownby says Justin used a seed to grow the pumpkin that came from a record-breaking pumpkin grown in Tennessee that weighed more than 1,700 pounds. … Christin Ownby says the pumpkin remains floating in the pond at last check, saying ‘It will make a great snack for the catfish!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“When I was growing up, I thought ‘gyp’ was simply a synonym for ‘cheat,’ and used it accordingly. It was only when I was an adult that I learned that gyp was short for gypsy. At which point, I stopped using it. … Why? Simple decency. … It’s a question not of who or how many had their feelings hurt, but of whether you want to associate yourself with a word that, for whatever historical reason having nothing to do with you, carries inherently derogatory connotations.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Oct. 17, 2013.

Clinton in recent weeks has privately stated she would enter the 2020 presidential race if she were certain she could win, The New York Times reported Tuesday.

Ingraham spoke of the weakness among the Democratic frontrunners, in particular former Vice President Joe Biden.

""The walking, talking gaffe-a-matic machine known as Joe Biden may have dropped in the polls for a few weeks, but now he's back on top. And what seems to be the grudging recognition that the other top candidates, Warren and Sanders, are just not going to cut it in key battleground states where common sense still means something,"" Ingraham said. ""I mean, who doesn't think that Hillary is a stronger candidate than that goofball Biden.""

On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that the average premium for the Affordable Care Act benchmark plan would drop by 4 percent in 2020, with 20 more insurance plans becoming available on healthcare.gov.

HOUSE GOP RELEASE PLAN IN BID TO FULFILL TRUMP PROMISE AS 'PARTY OF HEALTH CARE'

CMS Administrator Seema Varna also testified on Capitol Hill Wednesday, during a House Energy & Commerce hearing titled: “Sabotage: The Trump administration’s attack on health care,” that in some states, premiums are dropping even more significantly.

In Delaware, premiums dropped 20 percent; in North Dakota premiums dropped 15 percent; and in Oklahoma, dropped 14 percent. Three states, though, -- Indiana, Louisiana, and New Jersey -- will see premiums increase 10 percent or more.

The Trump campaign told Fox News that those figures are a result of action taken by the administration over the last few years to make the Affordable Care Act more competitive, deliver more free-market principles, give consumers more options, and improve the ObamaCare marketplace.

“While Democrats continue to push the narrative that President Trump is trying to ‘sabotage’ their health care, the latest data confirm exactly the opposite,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News.

Democrats on the Energy & Commerce Committee on Wednesday, though, blasted the administration, claiming it was engaging in a ""concerted effort to cut back on people's health insurance, their benefits, and what kind of coverage they have.""

Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said the administration is actively supporting a lawsuit that would overturn the Affordable Care Act and strip health care coverage from tens of millions of Americans and place ""extremely burdensome and sometimes illegal hurdles"" for Medicaid recipients.

""I am deeply concerned,"" he said.

2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SAYS WARREN IS LYING ABOUT HEALTH CARE PLAN: 'IT'S A SOUNDBITE'

Earlier this year, the administration told a federal appeals court that the program in its entirety should be abolished. Democrats criticized the administration and Republicans for trying to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

But the White House has touted a number of improvements under the ACA since Trump took office--including the administration's ability to ""make it easier for small businesses and self-employed workers"" to join and create Association Health Plans; the expansion of short-term, limited-duration plans that typically cost less than other ObamaCare options; the expansion of health reimbursement arrangements; and the elimination of the individual mandate, which forced Americans to buy health insurance, whether they wanted to or not.

This month, Trump signed an executive order that “directed HHS to take a number of specific, significant steps that will meaningfully improve the financing of Medicare, advance the care American seniors receive from their doctors, and improve the health they enjoy.""

But even as the Trump re-election campaign and Trump administration takes credit for the Affordable Care Act’s current stability, officials and Republican lawmakers are still pursuing Trump’s 2016 campaign promise of trying to do away with the program altogether.

This week, the Republican Study Committee released a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, two years after the GOP was unable to agree on a health care plan to scrap ObamaCare during the first year of Trump’s administration.

The new 66-page framework also represents an effort to compete with 2020 Democrats pushing health care plans like ""Medicare-for-all."" The new plan looks to “transform the individual marketplace’s current regulatory structure, unwind the ACA’s Washington-centric approach and largely return regulatory authority to individual states.”

""Until Congress gets around to replacing it, the president will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans,"" HHS Secretary Alexander Azar said. ""The president who was supposedly trying to sabotage this law has been better at running it than the guy who wrote it.""

As for 2020, Democratic presidential hopefuls like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have blasted Trump for his handling of the health care system, and are peddling a sweeping ""Medicare-for-all"" policy.

Candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden have instead touted ObamaCare, and proposed building on the Obama-era health care overhaul, while criticizing Trump for his moves to eliminate it.

“Before Donald Trump even stepped foot into the Oval Office, he pledged to strip millions of Americans of their health care,"" Biden said in a statement released by his campaign earlier this month. “As Donald Trump continues attempting to tear down the Affordable Care Act, I will fight him every step of the way.”

Meanwhile, with regard to the lawsuit, a federal appeals court in New Orleans could deliver its ruling on the case during the sign-up season--spanning from Nov. 1 in most states through Dec. 15.

Azar said that he was not concerned, even if the judges rule to throw out the entire health care program.

""Our messaging would be to keep calm and carry on,"" he said, noting that the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court. ""There will be no immediate disruption to anyone.""

Bob Paulson: The Mountie

Chuck Rosenberg: Welcome to The Oath. I’m Chuck Rosenberg, and I am honored to be your host for another thoughtful conversation with a fascinating guest. Bob Paulson, our very first international guest on the Oath, served as the twenty third commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The iconic Mounties are the Federal Police Force of Canada, but they have a broad mandate also to enforce municipal and provincial law in Canada. After a stint as an officer and a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force, where he learned hard and humbling lessons about leadership. Bob worked his way up through the RCMP, starting as a constable in a small British Columbia town where he fell in love with policing. A thoughtful, progressive and inspirational leader with a keen sense of humor, Bob Paulson explains the history of the Mounties, his own successes and failures as he rose through its ranks to lead the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lessons learned during an extraordinary career in law enforcement. Bob Paulson, welcome to The Oath.

Bob Paulson: Well, thank you. Thanks for having me, Chuck.

Rosenberg: You know, you are our first international guest. We are here in Ottawa, your nation’s capital, beautiful city, and it’s awfully nice of you to sit down with us.

Paulson: Well, I’m honored that you asked.

Rosenberg: Many of our listeners are from Canada and other countries around the world. But most of our listeners are American. And so, they may not know much about the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or that you were its former commissioner. And I was going to ask you a bunch of questions about it and about you.

Paulson: Sure. Yeah.

Rosenberg: So, tell us about you.

Paulson: Me? Well, I’m retired two years from the RCMP, but I was a career RCMP officer. I started out as a constable at the lowest rank in British Columbia in 1986.

Rosenberg: Is that where you grew up?

Paulson: No, actually, I grew up in a place called Lachute, which is near Montreal, so in Quebec.

Rosenberg: Long before you joined the RCMP as a constable, you served in the Royal Canadian Air Force.

Paulson: Yeah, I was a pilot. I went through 1977. I entered through the officer Canada training plan and got my wings and stayed in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, which is in the center of the country as an instructor pilot and I was fairly young

Rosenberg: Did you like flying?

Paulson: I loved flying. I hadn’t flown before I joined as a pilot. In fact, my first flight was on the airline to basic training.

Rosenberg: The first time you’d ever been a passenger?

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah.

Rosenberg: So, how did you know you wanted to be a pilot, or did you know?

Paulson: Well, it seemed exciting. My brother had joined–my older brother–had joined the military and was a naval officer. When I considered it, I thought being a jet pilot would be cool. And it was, it was very, very exciting. And the flying was great, but that’s where I started getting exposed at that real, sort of, meaningful level to responsibility, professionalism, and leadership. And I had a bad goal in the military.

Rosenberg: You told me that you grew up a lot as a result of serving in the Air Force.

Paulson: My, my time in the Air Force was a significant failure. And it was both a professional failure and a personal failure.

Rosenberg: And it in what way, Bob?

Paulson: So, I got my wings and I qualified as a jet pilot and I was also a jet pilot instructor and I was very young. And I had some responsibility to look after, to bring three or four student pilots along every day, doing their missions, doing their flights with them, critiquing them, helping them learn. But, I also had a responsibility as an officer and in the Canadian Forces. And so, while my pilot skills were very good, my, my officer development skills were lacking. And I didn’t–I didn’t service that part of the arrangement. Consequently, my first assessment that I got in the military from my flight commander, I remember it like it was yesterday, it was a kind of a punch in the face. I remember him looking me in the eye and saying and having written in my assessment, “Lieutenant Paulson displays significant downward flowing loyalty.”

Rosenberg: What did that mean?

Paulson: Well, I wasn’t sure. I knew it wasn’t good. But, I think the lesson that it was, and I came to understand what it was, is that I wasn’t servicing the organizational interest. I wasn’t participating in the mission of the organization. I was consumed with being popular. And consequently, I was hanging out with my students. You know, I was going for cocktails with them and being a friend as opposed to being their supervisor, being their officer. And it was a failure. I got in trouble. Well, an illustration of it is how I ended up getting charged and basically grounded in my flying career. I took a student out to the West Coast on near the end of his training.

Rosenberg: This is a separate matter,

Paulson: A separate matter, but illustrative, I think, of the failure that I’m not focusing on.

Rosenberg: We’re gonna focus on some successes later.

Paulson: Hopefully I have a couple that we can talk about. But, you know, as we talked about earlier, Chuck, I think failure, adversity is a key component to success, ultimately, and without a good understanding of the risks and the stakes, I don’t think you can succeed. In fact, in my case, I’m completely persuaded that had I not failed at such a level in the military, I wouldn’t have succeeded to the level that I did, if we can define my career as a success, ultimately.

Rosenberg: So, back to your story about the student pilot out West.

Paulson: Yeah. So, he had a brother who worked in a control tower and we were taking students out and exposing them to high density flight areas.

Rosenberg: What does that mean?

Paulson: So, a student pilot has to learn how to how to navigate an airplane into a high-density area, into a major metropolitan airport like Vancouver, Vancouver International, very busy airport, one of the busiest in Canada. So, that’s where we had gone. And in and around Vancouver, as in many cities, there’s a number of airports that are around there. This place was called: Pitt Meadows, and the student persuaded me that–I shouldn’t say persuaded me–I mean, the idea was, let’s take the airplane and go do a little impromptu air show over at this airport where my brother is in the control tower.

Rosenberg: Just for fun.

Paulson: Just for fun. Just for ego and just for a zoom, zoom jollies. And it was rife with bad judgment on my part, right. Not only was I the pilot in command of the aircraft, but I had, sort of, a responsibility for this young, want to be officer. So, we go to the airport, we close off the inter runway. We didn’t have radio communications because in those days the military airplanes had UHF radios and civilian aviation VHF radios. So, we beat up the airport, that was the vernacular, we beat it. We zoom bass, forward, and did all sorts of high speed passes. But at the end, I pulled up vertical. I did a series of vertical rolls. And that day, there was about a 6000-foot overcast ceiling. And I rolled off the top as I went vertical. And then, I pulled down towards the ground and I entered cloud at the top of my arm. And then I came around, went off to our mission, and we landed safely, ultimately on Vancouver Island, which is on the on the west coast of Canada. I didn’t know this, but there was a ministry of transport instructor doing check rides for private pilots that day. And, you know, he got the benefit of this impromptu air show by this irresponsible pilot from the Canadian Armed Forces. And he made notes, and he said ultimately, he wouldn’t have been so outraged had I not entered cloud at the top of the arc because I hadn’t considered, I ought to have known, but the pit metal localizer, which is one of the beams that guides aircraft down for landing, is used as a standard terminal arrival rooting for all of the commercial aircraft that would come into Vancouver International.

Rosenberg: And you’re flying acrobatics in there—

Paulson: In cloud–

Rosenberg: In a cloud, on their approach.

Paulson: Yeah, so pretty hard to blame the inspector. And ultimately, he complained to the military. They did a bit of an inquiry. Wasn’t particularly difficult given that he got the tail number of the airplane. And I was charged. I was charged under the National Defense Act.

Rosenberg: What does that mean?

Paulson: Well, the National Defense Act has a Queen’s Regulations and Orders, which is like a code of justice for the military. It’s equivalent to a criminal consequence. So, I was charged with performing aerobatics in a controlled zone. I was charged with failing to maintain the prescribed distance from cloud. And I was charged with the catch all, which is: conduct prejudice to the good order and discipline of the Canadian Armed Forces. And I had a bit of a summary trial. I didn’t defend myself. And as they say in the military, march they guilty son of a gun in. And I did. I marched in and took my lumps. But that was effectively the end of my career in the military. I was grounded, ultimately, and then transferred to a ground position in North Bay on the east side of the country. And so there already a fair bit of shame and embarrassment and shock that I had fallen so significantly, but not so much that I was prepared to leave the military. I thought I could salvage it.

Rosenberg: You still enjoyed it?

Paulson: I enjoyed the flying, but I wasn’t doing any flying. And I found myself being a production officer in an engineering section, which wasn’t what I was qualified to do, or what signed up for. But, ultimately, I met the commander of the squadron there in North Bay and he took pity on me and I started flying T-33s again. T-33s were the first-generation axial flow jet engines that we used as targets for real pilots. But, but I was able to fly a few missions and, and, so I thought I was getting back on track. But this, sort of, adolescent judgement of mine reared its head again, and I had some disagreements with some navigators that were flying with me. You know, one time, I’m flying out of Calgary, we’re going from eastern Canada to the West Coast, we have to stop to get gas because these little jet airplanes don’t go very far. So, I took off out of Calgary, and I got an overheat light, which is significant, a warning in a small airplane. So, I reduced power, and was going to–I declared a bit of an emergency, and came around. I was going to land.

Rosenberg: Back at Calgary?

Paulson: Back in Calgary. Calgary has got one of the longest airports in Canada –it’s got, what, 10,500-foot runway. That’s relevant because the checklist for an overheat required that I burn fuel down to reduce the weight so I could land, and put the brakes on, but I didn’t do that for some reason. I didn’t want to go fly out, and spend a lot of time flying over the mountains waiting for the fuel. And so, I landed and I took it just about every inch of that runway to land

Rosenberg: Because you’re heavy.

Paulson: And the brakes were red hot and the fire people came out and the navigator who couldn’t fly in the back was a little upset. And then, we had this, sort of, diagnose what was wrong. And I talked to the techs back at our home base, and they say: “you know what, maybe a blow by condition, which was this, the seeding of the exhaust pipe,” and didn’t have afterburners, that T-33. But because it gets so hot, it has to expand. And when it expands, its seats, sometimes its tailpipe is loose. So, I went out and I checked that, said: “yeah, yeah, it’s a little looser than normal, so let’s go.” I said to the navigator, “let’s go. We’re gonna go, and we’re gonna fly over the Rockies on reduced power.” He said: “no, no, no, that’s a bad idea. It’s not like we’re in war over here. What’s the urgency?” Get a tech to come up and fix it.

Rosenberg: Take your time, get it right, and then we’ll go.

Paulson: That’s right. I said: “no, no. I’m the pilot in command. Yeah, rank me by rank. But I’m the decision maker for the airplane because I’m the pilot.” So, he strapped in and strapped in and we took off at a reduced power setting, we made it out, but he wasn’t very happy because if the–my reckoning wasn’t correct, you know, he was out to get out and walk, and he didn’t want to do that. So, when we landed, he complained. And of course, he was right. I mean, it was very poor judgment, and it was characteristic of my approach to my responsibilities in those days. I was a, I was an adolescent and a young man’s body. And I was making decisions that had consequences for people’s lives. And I wasn’t executing on that responsibility. And ultimately, the military agreed. And I agreed at the end of my obligatory service. “Maybe you should go out and find something else to do. Mr. Paulson.” “Roger,” I resigned from the military honorably. It was all good. It was just a bad experience.

Rosenberg: But it must have stung.

Paulson: Oh, it stung. Yeah, stung my ego, it, it was embarrassing, it was shocking, personally. Yeah, and as we talked about, you know, there’s a greater consequence to a social harm, right. Plus, the ego that was, you know, I, I was a jet pilot in a military, and now, I’m not. So, I left.

Rosenberg: After leaving the military, and studying in college, you decided to join the RCMP?

Paulson: Yeah. So, I mean, when I was going to university, I was working in a bar a night. I got married when I left the military. And my wife was still in the military out west. So, I was traveling back and forth to Vancouver. And I was working in this bar, which was kind of a ne’er-do-well bar and a bit of a rough and tumble place. And one day, I saw this guy really clean cut, fit, looking, sharp guy, talking to the bartender, who was a female, by the name of Linda, I said: “who is that guy?” “Oh,” she said, “he’s a narc.” I said “a narc?” “Yeah, yeah, a RCMP officer,” and I said, “what do you want?” “He’s just talking to me. He thinks I’m his informant, but he likes to come in and know who’s who and you want to know who you are.” And so, I got thinking about that because I grew up in eastern Canada. So in Canada, there’s ten provinces, three territories. The RCMP polices at every level of policing in all but two provinces. So, in central Canada, Ontario and Quebec, we don’t have a, sort of, uniformed presence there. The RCMP didn’t do local policing and they didn’t do provincial policing. They just simply did federal policing akin to the FBI.

Rosenberg: Right. And so, for our U.S. listeners, that part of the RCMP is mandate, is like what they know of the FBI.

Paulson: Right.

Rosenberg: You are the federal police for Canada. That’s right. Similar to the Australian Federal Police or to the New Zealand police.

Paulson: Exactly. Yeah. But in those eight other provinces where the provincial police–and in about two seventy municipalities where the municipal police, and in the territories where the territorial police.

Rosenberg: And that model is very different than the FBI.

Paulson: In fact, it’s unique in the world. And if, if and when, and we do get it right from time to time, there is tremendous value in having that ability to draw and police from, from a perspective where you have all levels of communities and provinces and the country in your jurisdiction, right. It’s an incredible intelligence and strategic opportunity. So, I had grown up in an area where I didn’t see RCMP. I knew of them. I knew that they were the FBI. But it got me thinking about what this guy was doing. And so, next time he was in, I talked to him, and he was a street crime guy. So, he was kind of dressed casually, but he’d go around, and he’d try to understand who’s who. And that’s obviously one of the places you’d want to inform yourself of, is the ne’er-do-well bar, and who’s showing up, and what’s going on. So, it was interesting and it caused me to go down the local detachment and apply.

Rosenberg: You tell an interesting story about your application process and your interview process. Do you mind sharing that with us?

Paulson: In Canada, we have two official languages: French and English. And fortunately for me, my mother spoke French to me and I can speak French. So, starting off the story, I go to the detachment, I say, “well, I’d like to join.” She said, “Well, we’re only taking—“this is a female officer comes to the counter and says: “we’re only taking bilingual candidates.” I said: “well, I’m bilingual.” And then she says, “oh, I’m sorry, I’m not, so I’ll have to find someone who can call you.” So, I wait by the phone, a French officer calls me, and we have a nice conversation. And before you know it, I’m going through the process. And I get to the interview stage, which is the final stage. I’ve been tested, I’ve been examined, medically, psychologically, all of the tests that go into the process. And it’s looking pretty good. And Ken Pearson is his name, and I’ll remember him ‘till I die. He says to me: “so you’re a military pilot?” “Yeah.” “And you didn’t wash out?” “No, no I was an instructor and I got about 1,500 dollars.” “You mind telling me why you’re not a pilot anymore?” And so, I had perfected in my sort of dealing with my failure syndrome, I had perfected the art of telling a story about why I’m not a military pilot. You know, featured some of the trouble I got in, but not all the trouble.

Rosenberg: So, you had you had a version, but not a full version.

Paulson: Yeah, that’s right. And said: “Well, jeez, Mr. Paulson, I don’t see a problem here. I think we can get you on a troop right away. Are you free to go in January?” This was September. And I said, “yes, I am. That would be exciting. That’s great.” So, we stood up, and shook hands, and he slapped me on the back and out I went. I went home all excited that I was going to have another shot at redemption.

Rosenberg: You’re feeling pretty good.

Paulson: Feeling very good. Told my wife, as she then was, and she was a little skeptical. She said, “well, don’t get your hopes up.” And about a week and a half later, I got a call on my answering machine. And it was Ken Pearson, who was no longer Bob’s buddy. And it sounded more like the cop that he actually was. And he said, “yeah, look, we, we need to have another talk.” And so, I went down to Vancouver and he said, “I’m a little disappointed.” I said: “why?” “Well, did you not think we’d check into your previous employment?” I said: “Well, I thought you would.” He said: “we have no need of liars in the Mounted Police, Mr. Paulson.” I said, “I’m not a liar.” “Well, you didn’t tell me the whole story.” I said: “well, you know, there’s, there’s versions to that.”

Rosenberg: What did you leave out, Bob?

Paulson: I left out, sort of, the, the real reason why I left the military. I left–I had placed it more, as a sort of, I wasn’t compatible with the military, didn’t, sort of, jive with the leadership thing, and the actual specific failures. And there’s probably three or four of them that I can articulate that gave rise to this administrative burden that I placed on the armed forces. I left those out. And of course, those are all recorded, right.

Rosenberg: And they would matter a lot in this application process.

Paulson: Well, they’re looking for people who are going to go and have considerable sway over people’s lives. And it turns on truthfulness and the honor that a person can bring to their duties. I thought I was done for it. So, I gave him the whole story. And then he started shuffling, got a little nervous. He started shuffling his papers and holding his head in his hands and shaking his head. And then he looked me in the eye and he said, “look, Paulson, I don’t know why, but I got to take a chance on you. And if you let me down, I’m gonna come and find you.” You know, every time I tell that story, I get emotional because it was a break. It was the first real break I had in my sort of adult life. And I, you know, to this day, I say, I don’t know that I deserved a break, but he gave me one. And what that said about the organization, to me at the time, was this this is a place where I can where I can be honest with people, right. It was very, very significant.

Rosenberg: It was a real second chance.

Paulson: It was a real chance.

Rosenberg: You know, it’s interesting to me, Bob, on this show, we’ve talked with two retired four-star Navy admirals from the states: Jim Stavridis and Bill McRaven, and both describe in their own careers, and their own lives as junior officers, bad mistakes that they made. And second chances that they received, and how that played out for them when they became more senior officers.

Paulson: Right.

Rosenberg: And that they extended to others the same second chances that they had received when they were younger.

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah. And I’m struck by the relationship between adversity and leaders and how leaders deal with adversity. And failure is, is key to their success, right. Because you can’t go through any enterprise without having some stumbles. They’re not necessarily personal stumbles, but they’re stumbles in all manner of speaking. And, and how you deal with those, and how you help other people deal with those is the key to, to a successful leader.

Rosenberg: Ken Pearson let you in.

Paulson: Ken Pearson, let me. In fact, when I did the change of command ceremony and handed off to Brenda Lucki, who’s now the commissioner of the RCMP.

Rosenberg: She’s succeeded you as the 24th commissioner of the RCMP. You were the twenty third.

Paulson: Indeed. Yeah, that’s right. I talked about Ken–I don’t know if he’s still around—I, I should go and look him up and buy him a beer, but I owe him a lot.

Rosenberg: How did you like being a cop?

Paulson: Love being a cop. Fit me like a glove, and I couldn’t get enough of it.

Rosenberg: Now, before we go down this path, we should also explain something unusual about the RCMP, that there’s both, sort of, an enlisted rank and an officer rank.

Paulson: Yeah, so in the RCMP, of course, has a lot of history, a rich history, from you know, it was formed in 1873 when Canadian government and the Canadian country was just simply in the east of Canada, and the west were territories. And in fact, the RCMP was formed to go out and deal with the darn American whiskey traders who were polluting our indigenous folks and Western territories. And so, our primary mission was–and we call it the March West–when the force was formed, a couple of hundred officers, mostly taking from the military, and hence are a rich military tradition. And they marched west into this territory and brought law and order to the west.

Rosenberg: And it wasn’t the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the time. It was–it had a different name.

Paulson: It was called the Northwest Mounted Police, because in the territories, in the northwest. Of course, in modern terms, people question the means by which the whose issues were settled. But I mean, it was a different environment. And certainly, modern notions of justice were foreign to the world back then, and certainly in that territory. And then there was an issue as to whether or not they would be disbanded, or not because they were entering into contractual arrangements with provinces that were being formed in the west, Saskatchewan being one of them. And they were gonna disband them because there was a federal police force called the Dominion Police. But, then they merged them together and made the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. And that’s the origins of the force.

Rosenberg: And the organization you ultimately joined,

Paulson: Ultimately joined, and ultimately led.

Rosenberg: So, explain how there’s both an enlisted rank and an officer rank within the RCMP.

Paulson: Right. So, because of the military traditions, they kept the rank structures and so on the rank structures of the modern RCMP, and they’ve changed little over time. You started out as a constable and you become a corporal and then you become a sergeant and then you become a staff sergeant and you may become the sergeant major. And those are all noncommissioned ranks. The officer, the executive level of the force, starts at the inspector level, and goes like, inspector superintendent, Chief Superintendent, Assistant Commissioner, Deputy commissioner, Commissioner. And so, you seek a commission at the sergeant rank, basically sergeant or staff sergeant, if you’re advanced. It used to be very, very restricted. And now, it’s more, sort of, developmental as we identify people who are good leaders and can be good executives.

Rosenberg: But you started out as a constable?

Paulson: Everyone does. In the RCMP, we insist that all officers come from our enlisted ranks. And so, I started as a constable, and I was particularly interested in the crime solving element of it. I used to read all–you know, off duty, I would go in and read files of murder files or complex robbery files or serial offender files. It just fascinated me because I’d never sort of understood that kind of bad people that were out there. But, you get, as a cop, you begin to sort of get exposed to, holy smokes, I didn’t realize this kind of stuff was going on out there.

Rosenberg: In your own community.

Paulson: In your own community.

Rosenberg: You don’t see it.

Rosenberg: That’s right.

Rosenberg: As a civilian.

Paulson: Yeah, particularly in great countries like we’re blessed to live in, right. We’re by and large, mostly safe.

Rosenberg: We are.

Paulson: My eldest daughter, who’s now a federal prosecutor in Vancouver, probably won’t like me telling this story, but on my days off, we would work shifts. So, four on, four off, right? Twelve hour shifts. On my days off, I get her, my dog would go into my jeep.

Rosenberg: Your dog, Sam.

Paulson: My dog Sam. It was a big black lab. And we’d drive around town and look for people that I had warrants for. And they got, you know, 18-month-old baby in the back in the car seat.

Rosenberg: And a big old, lab

Paulson: Big lab and we’re putting the arm on these guys. And I loved it, and I talked to them all, and I try to understand what drove them and what motivated them.

Rosenberg: And you’re good at talking to people.

Paulson: I am good at talking to people, yeah.

Rosenberg: Do you like that?

Paulson: Yeah, I do. I do like it. I like, I like reaching inside because I–and it goes back to my failure before–like, life’s, life’s challenging. Life can be hard. And everybody faces some sort of adversity. And when you can tap into people’s challenges and, you know, offer a hand, it’s very rewarding.

Rosenberg: I imagine as a constable on the streets of

Paulson: Chilliwack,

Rosenberg: Chilliwack.

Paulson: Yeah,

Rosenberg: You run into lots of addiction problems, mental health problems, people who are down and out for various reasons.

Paulson: But, there’s another, there’s another, sort of, awakening in me, is understanding what was driving criminality, because I took–in in Bob’s simple world, you have people who, sort of, are driven by consequence to crime. You know, they have no money, they have drug addictions, they have alcohol problems, they have familial difficulties. And they have to do something in order to live. And then, you’ve got the, sort of, I want to be a bad guy, class of person, and we can talk about them later. But my early my early exposure to that was that mostly, for example, burglaries. We started big problem burglaries. So, if you had a clearance rate of, a clearance rate being how many of the burglaries that you solve of 20 percent, you were doing really, really good, right.

Rosenberg: So, largely, an unsolved crime.

Paulson: Yeah, but if you stop and think who’s doing who’s doing burglaries in a town, who does that right. It’s people that need the instant access to cash, to get drugs, to get booze. Kids who want toys that they don’t have, kids who want stereos. It’s not hard to figure out.

Rosenberg: So, the distinction you would make there, is people forced to crime as opposed to attracted to crime.

Paulson: Exactly. Exactly. Or interested in crime, right. Early on in my career, I was putting that together. I was very lucky in the kind of people I got to be with as I came up in the job. Very, very lucky. And my trainer used to insist that on every burglary, you go and do a series of inquiries in the neighborhood, and find out who’s who. Every neighborhood has its own character. And it’s not, it’s not exceedingly difficult to figure out who’s doing the burglaries. And so, I would do that, and I’d talk to all the neighbors. If you’ve seen anything he had any trouble, any? Oh, yeah, we’ve seen this Pinto That’s been–you remember the Ford Pinto? Very distinctive looking car. And it was, I think, a pink or a red one. So, I was writing it all up and I was giving it to the detectives and I was on the hunt for this Pinto. I go home from a night shift, first night shift, the burglary street crew guys. They find this Pinto. They find a woman who’s driving it, and they find some, some property that they can attribute to a crime. And so, they arrest her. And when I get to work that night, she’s in cells in a strait-jacket. And so, I talked to the burglar guys and I said, “so what she’s got?” They said, “now she won’t talk. She will not talk. She’s gone nuts. She’s DTA. She’s throwing herself against the bar. ”She’s sort of coming down off of drugs, off of heroin. She was a heroin addict. And so, they were only going to be able to charge her with possession of stolen property, which was what was in the car. And the link to possession, you know, easy to say, hard to prove. You got to show that she had knowledge that those things were in the car. So, long story, long story short, it wasn’t looking good. Was probably going to get released. So, I went inside her in the cell and she was in a strait-jacket, I started talking to her and got down the floor with her, and she asked for a cigarette. And I smoked in those days. I gave a cigarette and we started talking about her addiction and her problems and her arrest. I said, “you want to go? You want to go in a room and get coffee or something?” “Yeah.” So, I take this jacket off. We go in the room. We’re talking about her. We’re talking about her problems. We’re talking about, you know, how she became addicted. And then she offered up. I’ve have been doing all these burglaries, I’ve been doing all these break ins, is the vernacular.

Rosenberg: Breaking and entering.

Paulson: Yeah, I said: “really? And I thought you were because I saw this Pinto everywhere” I went, I said: “how many have you done?” She said: “Jeez, I don’t know. Hundreds.” “Hundreds? Well, we’ve got to put this together.” Can we put this together and she offered: well, why don’t we do this, officer? Why don’t we get in your car? Because I know the neighbors don’t know the names of the streets. You drive around and I’ll tell you which house it is and. So, I went back and told my boss and he said, “wow, really, I’m going to put Jenkins with you there so she doesn’t run off.” And we went and drove all over town, I cleared 52 burglaries that night just by talking to her, just by being sort of human to her. And that was the, another insight into, into policing, is that it’s a very, very important job, but you can’t just do it on the back of authority.

Rosenberg: I found, as a federal prosecutor, Bob, that really you could talk to just about anyone if you had a degree of empathy, you were willing to listen, put judgment aside, and treat people with civility.

Paulson: Indeed. Indeed. Yeah, and so, that embarked–led me down a path of serious crime work because I was brought into a plainclothes section within the year. Like I’d been on the road for a year now, I’m in plainclothes.

Rosenberg: Canada generally is a low crime, low homicide, low shooting country. It’s a very safe country. Is that a fair characterization?

Paulson: Well, I think if, you know, if the comparison is the United States, I think it is.

Rosenberg: But nevertheless.

Paulson: Yeah. No, it is a relatively safe country. And that’s why I think that when we have violent crimes, or we have serial offenders, or we have those types of really community-shocking crimes, that we, we mobilize, you know, heaven and earth to make sure that we get in front of it. But it’s a growing trend. We have an excess of excessive gun violence in Canada now.

Rosenberg: So, you’re promoted through the ranks of the RCMP. You’re still enlisted, right? You’re not yet a commissioned officer. What do you make that jump?

Paulson: So, I go from Chilliwack. My wife is in the military, so I have to move to another, fairly remote, part of British Columbia, which is on the west side of the country and the West Coast. And, back in uniform again. And then, they start the promotion exercise, they changed the promotion system, such that it’s a knowledge based exam. And so, I aced that, I got the highest mark in the country. So, I’m promoted to corporal in Prince Rupert, which is a very remote area of Canada, it’s on the north west coast of British Columbia. And that was some fascinating policing because I got to do some very interesting work with indigenous folks. And, you know, the RCMP has a long tradition from its origin of dealing with Aboriginal people. Well, we also have a very shameful history of having participated in some of the most notorious incidents with indigenous people in Canada.

Rosenberg: Would you describe some of that?

Paulson: Yeah. So, when I go up to Prince Rupert, there is a massive public outcry, over the recognition that residential schools where indigenous folks, young people were ripped from their families, and put in these, sort of, regional areas for schooling in accordance with the European notions of education. And were just taken from there. And who are the people that we’re doing the use of force element of that enforcement? It was the RCMP, but we did an investigation to try and reconcile that because many of the students in the residential schools were abused, some horribly, some, some killed. And it was, it was just a black mark on the country and particularly on the force who participated in that. And so, we’re trying to put some justice to it. And we did a national investigation to find these people. But I’ll tell you a quick story that was really–I used it when I apologized on behalf of the RCMP, to the Aboriginal people of Canada.

Rosenberg: This is when you were a commissioner.

Paulson: When I was commissioner, I offer this apology. But when I was a corporal, I was tasked with investigating all these people, these list of students, go find these students and find out what happened to them. And so, I’m traveling all over the northwest of British Columbia looking for these. One guy left on the list, I couldn’t find, and he was in a community called Terrace, British Columbia, which is a little bit more north than on the coast as well. Turns out, what I could find about him was that he had succumbed to drugs and alcohol and it was a street person. And, you know, good luck finding a street person if they didn’t want to be found. But, I had the local detachment look out for him. And if ever they found him, get him into a tank, and sober him up. And I wherever I was, I’d be there. And so, I got–we found him. So, I show up, and he’s in bad, bad shape. So, we give him rest. We clean him up and get him to an interview room and the man’s a victim. So, we think we shouldn’t be treating him like he’s a crook. And he wants to know what this is all about. And I tell him a little bit about it. We go through his history, and he’s telling me the history of his experience with residential school, and how he was abused there by one of the priests at this particular school. And he was old enough that he knew they didn’t want to have that happen to him. And so, he ran away from the school. And so, what would happen when they ran away from the school? He went home and his parents were trying to hide him. But guess who showed up to take him away?

Rosenberg: The RCMP.

Paulson: The RCMP, and forced them back in there and he says: “and then it happened again.” And then he went through this, what I referred to, as a moment of clarity that we had between us as we both broke into tears, and we realized his whole life had been wasted and destroyed because of what had happened,

Rosenberg: Had been stolen from him.

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah. It’s a very profound moment.

Rosenberg: What happened to him, Bob?

Paulson: Well, he was, you know, ultimately compensated, as all the victims were. But there’s no giving a person back their life, right. But it was an education for me to understand the consequences of these sort of decisions that institutions make, or other governments make, and institutions implement and how, you know, there needs to be some consideration put into those things. And it was–it stayed with me all my life.

Rosenberg: But credit to the RCMP for helping to fix a horrific problem that they had contributed to.

Paulson: Right.

Rosenberg: Earlier in their history.

Paulson: One of the things with the RCMP that’s interesting, is that the history the RCMP is very iconic in Canada.

Rosenberg: It’s iconic in the United States, too. I mean, we all have an image of that RCMP Mountie.

Paulson: Right. And, you know, the idea that, that the history and the image and the, sort of, weight of the identity of the force, and that’s how we refer to it, the force, as though it’s in a Star Wars, that somehow that is relevant to decisions that leaders make in the execution of their duties as law enforcement officers, whether it be federally, provincially, or municipally. It was a characteristic that I think hurt the RCMP, right. Because we both wanted to stay in history and retain that iconic, classic, sort of, image, and not modernize, not let go of some of those things. So the idea that decisions, modern decisions being made on the back of history and not on their merits, not on the current reality, not on principle and values, was something that that I came to try to fix in the RCMP. And it was difficult.

Rosenberg: When did you become an officer, Bob?

Paulson: So, I was commissioned to the rank of inspector in late 2001, and I was put into a position called the Major Case Manager for Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs in British Columbia. And I was put there, by and large, well, entirely, by one of my most influential mentors, who was a guy called Gary Bass, who was then, the criminal operations officer for the province of British Columbia. So, he was like the number two police officer. But he was in charge of operations. He says, “congratulations, Bob, you’re an inspector.” I said, “yes. So, I’m going to need, you know, meet, need some people. I need some money.” And he says, “well, you’re not to go figure that out.” But he wanted me to attack the Hell’s Angels, who had been there, too, for untouched. In terms of criminal investigations, they’re very resilient. And depending on where they are, in which chapters, like the B.C. chapters of the Hell’s Angels are the most successful.

Rosenberg: The British Columbia chapter.

Paulson: British Columbia. Yes, British Columbia chapter most successful, richest ,and influential

Rosenberg: And violent.

Paulson: And violent in the world.

Rosenberg: And how did the Hells Angels sort of infiltrate British Columbia? This wonderful, beautiful, pastoral part of your country?

Paulson: Well, it’s interesting. The history is the mafia in Montreal where, in partnership with the Hells Angels in Montreal. And they sent out people to, sort of, build the grassroots of the Hells Angels out there.

Rosenberg: So, very much by design.

Paulson: Oh, entirely by design. They’re a very strategic organization. And if we could be a strategic in some of the things that we did as they were in the things that they did, we’d be much–in fact, that, you know, I lecture often about leadership and so on. And one of the things that you have to put on those characteristics of effective leaders is morality, because some of the most effective leaders I’ve seen have been criminals. If you measure it simply by, you know, the outcome and, and their, you know, desired outcome.

Rosenberg: And by leadership, you’re not talking about values based leadership. You’re just talking about the ability to lead.

Paulson: To marshal resources and people towards an outcome.

Rosenberg: OK. So, a brand-new Inspector Paulson, go solve this Hells Angels problem in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Paulson: That’s right.

Rosenberg: What did you do?

Paulson: Well, I went around to everybody who had money and resources and people, and persuaded them to give me some of them. So, because I was able to draw a picture of many of the murders that were happening and many of the recent unprosecuted drug seizures that we had, I was able to identify a target group. And I was able to persuade people that we are going to be successful if we are able to infiltrate them, if we’re able to use people from within to betray them, effectively. And if you’ve got experience with organized crime groups, and particularly successful organized crime groups, that’s one of the only ways–like they’re impervious to wiretaps, simply. The Hells Angels in British Columbia would have their lawyers hold seminars on crime solving techniques, such that when they would go for their walk and talks–walk and talks are a cop vernacular for a sneaky conversation that you can’t hear–they’d always sort of throw their arms around each other and talk in their ears, whispering in their ears. Ultimately, when I got an agent, I had my wife, so a microphone into his collar to pick up those conversations. And, but they’re strategic, right. They know what they want to do.

Rosenberg: Very careful. Good operational security.

Paulson: Right. And well instructed, right, well-prepared.

Rosenberg: And so how do you infiltrate a group like that?

Paulson: You target someone within their organization, and you use intelligence to recruit them, right. Either through circumstance that brings it to their advantage. In other words, you know, they’re in a jackpot and they need to get out of the jackpot. And they meet the, sort of, characteristics of a cooperative informant. And you can work them.

Rosenberg: Because unlike in the movies or in television, embedding an undercover in an organization like that is extraordinarily difficult.

Paulson: Very difficult, very difficult and impossible in the Hell’s Angels, because they have a very hierarchical sort of progressive development of these individuals. And they need–they do a history check on who you are and people vote for them and they do neighborhood inquiries like cops ought to do. They have puppet clubs, these clubs, puppet clubs are, are sort of, secondary, not full Hell’s Angels. They have other foolish names like, you know, The Reckoners or the Skull Daggers or whatever.

Rosenberg: But they’re affiliated.

Paulson: They’re affiliated. And they’re–you know, the Hells Angels use nominees to do most of their hands-on crime. And one of them, when I got into a fight with his wife and she burned down his house and he was in Prince George, which is in the north of the province. And I got wind of that, got in my car and drove up, had him brought in, and all his money was in the wall of this house, and was all burnt. And he didn’t have any more money. And he was the president of this club in Prince George.

Rosenberg: He was unhappy.

Paulson: He was vulnerable to recruitment. And so, speaking of Gary Bass again, so I talked to him and we talked about how we could maybe help his life out a little bit. And he said, you know, “50-grand. We could talk.” I didn’t have 50-grand. Drove all the way back to Vancouver from Kamloops about a two-and-a half hour drive. Got the approval. I got 50 grand, big wad of cash, stuffed it in my pants, drove back to the hotel room and then I’m 50 grand. I said, we have a deal. We got a deal. I stood up, shook my hands, took money from my belt, to his belt, and off we went.

Rosenberg: And you were in?

Paulson: We were in.

Rosenberg: And he abided by the deal.

Paulson: He did.

Rosenberg: What did what did he do for you?

Paulson: First of all, he informed us as to the realities of criminality within the relationship between his club and the Vancouver chapter of the Hells Angels. And then he was dealing and he was wearing a wire and he was putting a video where we needed it because we needed we need persuasive evidence. All right. Just even calling him a person of dubious character. Like he’s not going to be your star witness unless he’s corroborated excessively and completely by video, by audio. And so, what we wanted to do, is to have him develop and get up in the organization, you know, reach those successive layers.

Rosenberg: And that’s going to require some patience.

Paulson: It’s going to require patience. But it’s also going to require this because it’s gonna get a little legal. I’ll try to keep it simple, but because of the nature of the crime that they are doing, which is all nominee crime. Right. In other words, they would have their, their “mopes,” as we’d call them, go do the hands-on stuff. So, a full-patch Hell’s Angels would have a series of hang arounds that they would be very careful in giving instructions often would have instructions tiered down to those people.

Rosenberg: Giving the leadership of the Hells Angels some plausible deniability if things went bad

Paulson: Right. Insulation from the actual oil that you might get on your hands when you’re holding a wrench. So, in order to get to them, this guy had to get access to them, in order to get access to them, he had to be successful at doing what he was being told to do by lower level people. And so that required what we referred to as: allowing drugs to remain in circulation. So, there was one of these guys that was overseeing a series of meth production labs.

Rosenberg: And so, our listeners know, that it is a very difficult thing for law enforcement to do. In fact, in the United States, we have an obligation to take those drugs off the street.

Paulson: That’s right. That’s exactly right. Our policy in the day, the RCMP policy, was not to allow drugs to remain in circulation.

Rosenberg: People get hurt.

Paulson: People get hurt and then you’ve got your hands on it, right? And in fact, that I testified for weeks at this, ultimately, this trial on this very issue, because I was being accused, unsuccessfully, I might add, of adding to the risk that associates to these serious, serious drugs. But, for instance, he would be–our, our agent would be tasked to go to person A pickup, three kilos of meth, take them to person B, C and D, hand them off. Take the money. Bring it back. Put it into place and then come back and report.

Rosenberg: And in part, it’s because there’s an interest in letting the criminal enterprise run, gathering more intelligence, and having your informant sort of, ascend the ranks.

Paulson: Exactly.

Rosenberg: The tradeoff, of course, is that drugs are remaining in circulation.

Paulson: Indeed. And that was it. And so, we had to, we had to, sort of, devise a method that on principle that could be palatable not just to the RCMP, but to the courts, and ultimately, the Canadian public.

Rosenberg: To the society that you serve.

Paulson: Exactly. And weighing the proportional sort of harm that comes from allowing three kilos of meth to remain in circulation, but getting the guys that’s going to drive about five or six more labs.

Rosenberg: And this is not a class from hypothetical. This is something you have to wrestle with in real time. But the consequences, the morality of the legality.

Paulson: Exactly. It’s very difficult. And so, what we came up with because of the law allowed for it.

Rosenberg: In Canada.

Paulson: The law allows for it. Yeah, both controlled drugs and substances act as it then once and the criminal code contemplates police, or those working for the police, to engage in activity which would otherwise be criminal. And we’ve done in other areas where we wouldn’t have undercover officers. You know, for credibility, go slash tires of a car or something, or break a window, or break into a place or represent some sort of criminality. The means to do that was very elaborate and required authorities, and documented proportionality assessments, and wings that was quite elaborate and very sophisticated. Yet in our controlled Drugs and Substances Act, it wasn’t quite as elaborate. You were just simply under the guidance in a real investigation, you were allowed to embark on activities which would otherwise contravene the act. Anyway, so the law allowed for it, policy didn’t. I had to persuade people in Ottawa that, you know, Bob had a system that would be successful. And we documented every transaction and we did that proportionality weight in advance of the decision to allow things to go on. And sometimes, we would invest tremendous money at continuing surveillance for days until it was clear, or at least in our judgment, it was clear, that our agent would not be put at risk by the seizure. Right, and so, we would do everything to take the drugs out. And so that went on for a couple of years. It burned our agent out, but we were very successful and ultimately brought charges against a bunch of those bad guys. It didn’t stop the Hell’s Angels, but it just demonstrated that they were vulnerable. And there’s been a success of, sort of, series of successful prosecutions against them. But, you know, you had to up your game. You couldn’t just go, you know, follow the motorcycles around and hope that they were going to fall into some sort of handcuff.

Rosenberg: Now, you have to be proactive and creative and be willing to take a risk.

Paulson: Yeah, that’s right. And be able to defend the risk in a sort of principled way.

Rosenberg: Bob, there is a downside to doing such good work in British Columbia. I assume that the bosses back in Ottawa notice you in your work.

Paulson: They did. In fact, I had to go to Ottawa frequently for authorities, for some of the, kind of, bleeding edge stuff I was doing. And so, yeah, I got noticed. And I was I was offered a promotion to Ottawa, which I turned down.

Rosenberg: And why do you turn it down?

Paulson: Well, my family then, was grounded in the lower mainland.

Rosenberg: For us Americans.

Paulson: British Columbia. And they were very happy. They didn’t want to move. My wife didn’t want to move. And frankly, I was I was pretty happy. I wasn’t I was ambitious, but not ambitious in the get to the top of the force thing, I wanted to get sufficient authority to do the things I wanted to do.

Rosenberg: You wanted to resolve cases?

Paulson: Exactly. Exactly. And the higher up you get, the less sort of influence you have on individual cases, and the more responsibility you have for the systems and processes that guide those individual systems or those individual investigations. So, I didn’t want to move and I turned it down, and there was a bit of a consequence, although I was promoted, thanks to Gary Bass to superintendent in British Columbia.

Rosenberg: That’s a big job.

Paulson: It is a big job. And I was completed a mile and many put me in charge of community and aboriginal policing. And that–so I wasn’t doing investigations anymore. And then Ottawa came calling again and said they’d like me to go to Ottawa at a sort of entry level into the senior executive ranks.

Rosenberg: As a practical matter, can you say no again?

Paulson: I could have said no, but that had been the end of Bob again, right. That had been the end of Bob, the influential police officer. So, I persuaded my family to come along and we, we moved to Ottawa in 2006.

Rosenberg: Were you missing British Columbia?

Paulson: I was, yeah. I was missing, I was missing the work. But, I ended up being in charge of criminal intelligence. And then, I became the operations officer national security and ultimately promoted to the assistant commissioner in charge of national security at the time when the national security file was hopping. And that was a very exciting time, you know, coming from the major crime world, and having developed what, many have called this major case management, which is this sort of doctrine for how to support major cases to prosecution, I was able to bring some of that to to the world of national security and it was a great, great time. But there was a deputy commissioner who didn’t like me. So, Paulson wasn’t a good guy.

Rosenberg: How could that be?

Paulson: I know. Look at me. Listen to me. And I don’t know why he was he was very self-interested. And he did, unabashedly, have his eyes set on the commissioner’s chair

Rosenberg: And the commissioner and the RCMP, traditionally, at least came from within the ranks of the RCMP. Right.

Paulson: Yeah, exactly.

Rosenberg: Which is a little bit different, by the way, than the FBI director, who traditionally has never served as a special agent, for instance.

Paulson: Well, that’s right. And then, so this deputy commissioner was serving under the first civilian commissioner from the outside that we’d ever had.

Rosenberg: First, and only.

Paulson: First, and only, Bill Elliott, who I came to serve under at that point, I was off in contract policing.

Rosenberg: What does that mean, Bob?

Paulson: So, contract policing is the role where we create policies and oversight for our contractual arrangements with the provinces and municipalities. And so, t

Rosenberg: His is in the RCMP, his role as other than the federal police

Paulson: As the response to call people the provincial police force, the municipal police force. And from there, I was promoted to Deputy Commissioner in charge of federal policing, which is effectively the number two position. People in the contracts don’t like to hear this. It’s our core business. That’s why the organization exists, to do federal policing, national security, federal statutes, international obligations, protective policing. It is, in and of itself, a significant mandate. Many of the agencies, the United States, are created to do those specific things. In Canada, we have the one agency doing it. Then, the civilian commissioner retired after four years. And then, there was a competition. I went in the competition, and Prime Minister Harper called me to his office one day and said, “look, I’m considering appointing you to the commissioner, but I think I should probably talk to you first.” It was very process oriented, straightforward guy.

Rosenberg: You liked him?

Paulson: I liked the man and I liked his style. I liked how principled he was. But the fact that there was a political push to have someone else appointed commissioner, he didn’t know me from Adam.

Rosenberg: So, how did you come to his attention then, Bob?

Paulson: Through this process, you know, he says we need a commissioner, the RCMP. Do I want to appoint someone who’s sort of lined up to the conservatives, or do we want to run a process and try and select the most capable candidate for this? And the process ran. I went along. There was psychometric testing. There was a series of interviews.

Rosenberg: Must have been a bit of a head spinner. At one point, you’re on the floor of a jail cell sharing a cigarette with a woman in a straitjacket, who’s committed, you know, 52 burglaries, and now you’re in the office of the prime minister of Canada being interviewed to be the next commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Paulson: Absolute head spinner. You know, until I was the deputy commissioner and I was acting often for this civilian commissioner because he was–as he was leaving–I thought to myself, you know, I could probably do this job and I could probably fix some of these things I’ve been bellyaching about for years. When I threw my name in the hat, when the headhunter came and saw me and said, would you participate in this process? I said, “yes, I will.” And then I wanted it. And it was the first time I wanted it.

Rosenberg: And what about the moment you got it?

Paulson: Yeah. Then, it was like the dog chasing the car that catches it, right.

Rosenberg: What do I do now? When were you appointed the twenty third commissioner of the RCMP?

Paulson: In December 2011.

Rosenberg: And what did you want to do?

Paulson: I wanted to fix the place. I wanted to restore the trust that had been–it was it was being shaken as I was being appointed. There was a series of slow, terrible disclosures by female officers who had suffered harassment and sexual harassment and sexual violence, even at the hands of some of their supervisors. It was just shaking the place. I remember standing in the lobby of the House Commons next to the Minister, who was the minister of public safety, then announcing my appointment. And there was a series of reporters, a horseshoe of reporters and lights and cameras. And they weren’t all smiling. All right. They weren’t all sharing the moment with Bob.

Rosenberg: They weren’t as happy as you.

Paulson: Wanted to rip me limb from limb and say, what? What are you going to do about this? Right. And I remember thinking all I could talk about was I was going to bring leadership and accountability to the organization in ways that it hadn’t seen before. And it was going to be difficult, require time, require patience. That’s all I could say.

Rosenberg: With respect to the sexual harassment issues that you found in the RCMP, sounded like it had gone unaddressed. What did you do?

Paulson: I brought process to it. We needed to have a process by which they could be properly investigated. The criticism of that response is: just believe me, I’m here in the media. I’m telling my story. What else do you want? Like, where are these people being arrested? And are our processes and systems for dealing with complaints of harassment were not engendering the trust and the faith of the membership, so that they would have some sort of opportunity to have these complaints resolved in the near term.

Rosenberg: But they may have genuinely felt they didn’t have an avenue within the organization. They had to go outside.

Paulson: They absolutely felt that. They absolutely felt that. And, and lawsuits started mounting up, such that, we needed, you know, a separate office of our legal department to manage them all. And so, ultimately, we needed to get to a place where we could settle the lawsuits, but we couldn’t settle the lawsuits until we had some process by which we could respond, and have the institution recognized as being ready to respond to complaints of harassment, whether they be sexual, or not.

Rosenberg: That’s only a part of the problem. You have to respond to the complaints and have a process to resolve them, but you also have to fix the underlying culture.

Paulson: Right, it just wasn’t modern. And so, it required a number of changes on a number of fronts that recognize that these were not failures of individuals. For example, a young woman in a remote post, maybe there’s three or four officers there, and she wants to have a family, the enormous pressure and judgments and criticisms that she faces by getting pregnant, right, is that you’re, you’re letting the team down. And we’re building a team from the moment we’re bringing people into depot.

Rosenberg: By depot, you mean the RCMP training facility in Saskatchewan?

Paulson: Yeah, we bring 32 people together, and we forge those into a unit so that they understand what the team is. But then when you’re letting the team down because you want to go and have a life, you’re facing judgment. People felt that was their fault. And I said, “no, that’s not their fault. It’s our fault, because we can’t organize ourselves to support that, because the law says that we should support it—“

Rosenberg: –well, and then also it’s also the right thing to do.

Paulson: Right. Right. But it’s not an individual failure. It’s a management failure. We’re failing our people by not providing strategies and systems to support them, to have their lives, while they risk their lives for Canadians. You know, one of the features of an effective leader, in my estimation, one of the characteristics, is an action-oriented implementer, right. Someone who’s prepared to do things. Yes, I know that you’re the deputy commissioner of federal policing, that’s a very nice position you have there, Bob. What do you do when you hang your coat up, and what happens next? Then what do you do?

Rosenberg: What’s the plan?

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah. And so, I started out by–and you may get a kick out of this because our history is talking about the American constitution, which I’m a tremendous fan of.

Rosenberg: I know you read quite a bit about it.

Paulson: We studied it, actually on this course that I was blessed to have, and yeah, I’m a big fan. So, I tried to build a constitution for the RCMP. We have the RCMP Act, in which, you know, and that’s, that’s it, I mean, that’s the law. But I tried to get a document that would sort of frame up interests within the organization, and would frame up how things should roll, where authority lies, and what it means to have authority, and all the things, that was quite a beautiful document that I attached to our administrative manual. But, it had no sort of. You didn’t have any constitutional weight. It couldn’t be slapped over the head of anybody.

Rosenberg: Was that met with resistance, acceptance? How did folks feel about you trying to sort of create a constitution for the RCMP?

Paulson: It was met mostly with an open mouth stare.

Rosenberg: Meaning folks didn’t understand what you were trying to do.

Paulson: Right. You know, shame on me. But that, sort of, informed me a little bit about this sort of magnitude of the task that I was facing, in terms of modernizing.

Rosenberg: You know, it’s interesting. When I ran the DEA, we didn’t have a core values program, and I thought it was important just to articulate what our core values are. And there was a bit of an open mouth reaction. You know, why are we doing this? What do we need it for? How does it help us do our jobs? And the answer is: it may not help today or even tomorrow, but by articulating a set of core values for an organization, you’re framing your work for hopefully generations to come. But it’s a hard thing to explain in just a couple of sentences.

Paulson: Absolutely. And key to changing an organization, let alone, a culture, is having a vision that people can, sort of, attach to and say, “oh, I see what he’s talking about.: But here’s the thing I used to say a lot–I started out when I was a deputy commissioner–I said, you know, everybody’s pulling for the RCMP. Canadians love the RCMP. They want the RCMP to succeed.

Rosenberg: So, do Americans.

Paulson: Yeah. The work we do is important. And that gives us the status that we all sort of roll around in that we’re happy with. The work is important. But let me tell you how we do it. That’s more important. I made a point of lecturing to every commissioned officer class. I would talk about an interest-based leadership model. And according to Bob, the interest-based leadership model places a hierarchy over three, sort of, main interests. The public interest is at the top, organizational interest is at the second place, and employee interest is third place. And then I’d say, what do you think of that? It was like I’d sworn in front of everyone. It’s like I said something really, really bad because the idea of leadership is that you’re looking after people, like you can’t be a leader without people, you gotta look after your people, but you’ve got to be able to do it with a mission in mind, the organization’s mission, and you’ve gotta, sort of, be guided by the public interest. And there are people that are making decisions out of personal interest for promotions, for whatever, people that are making decisions that aren’t weighing on the organizational impact, which is not the image of the force, but the organizational interest is not being respected in the discharge of your duties. Back to Lieutenant Paulson getting his first assessment, you know, on the flight line, being told, hey, pal, you’re not. You know, you might think you have a couple of ranks up on your shoulder,

Rosenberg: But you’re not cutting it.

Paulson: You’re not cutting it and you’re not doing–you’re not honoring the contract that put those stars on your shoulder. You’re not doing that. So, you better start doing it. That was how I approach some of those things. And it was a–it was fascinating discussion with those young officers because they’d done decisions. And often in police work, decisions can be contained within the facts that you’re facing. But as you get up in rank, and you begin to take more responsibility, you’ve got to cover those things with some other interests besides, you know, your own y

Rosenberg: Our best leaders should have the broadest view.

Paulson: Exactly.

Rosenberg: And should understand why without having to be prompted. Public interest is more important than personal interest, or even, as you say, organizational interests.

Paulson: Indeed.

Rosenberg: Hard to find those people aren’t.

Paulson: And it’s hard even as I sit here today, as we militarize more and more, we’re bringing ourselves farther and farther away from the people that we are policing. And if policing means guard over the flock with the best, deadliest weapons, then OK, but that’s not what it is. And it’s a difficult conversation, particularly with the profession, because there’s some very strong emotions that form part of this deliberation.

Rosenberg: You know, we wrestle, too, in the United States, with this notion of police militarization. And I’ve always said: “it’s not the stuff. It’s how we use this stuff.” So, it’s one thing for a police department in a big city to have an armored personnel carrier. There might be a time that they need it, but they have to be very careful about rolling it out for an ordinary protest.

Paulson: Exactly. You need the equipment. But so, my position was, yeah, have the equipment. I remember I got into a shouting match with a subordinate officer in front of a senior officer when I was in contract. Please. So, I’m an assistant commissioner. We’re having a meeting in front of the deputy commissioner, and the chief superintendent, who is one rank below me, we’re talking about water cannons because we had the G-8 or G. 20 going on in Toronto. And he says, “yes, I got a water cannon, and we’re driving it down to Toronto.” I said: “what you mean you got to water cannon?” Well, we got one again. Where’d you get that? We bought it. “So, who’s who’s, who’s working it?” “I don’t know.

We’ll get there when we get there, their guys, the emergency response guys, they’ll work it.” “Under what conditions?” Well, like things get out of hand. Understood as what? So, but I felt when I was asking those questions, like I was outside of the police value system. Paulson, do you not get this? No, I get it. But you get what’s gonna happen when we deploy this water cannon and kill little Jimmy, who is just out there for his first protest. And we have two years of inquiry to live through. Like who do I referred them to, you know, like use your head so you can have the equipment we need the equipment in. And it’s like when I was saying earlier about, about how important the RCMP is to Canadians and what we do. Yeah, yeah. How do we do it, though? That’s really important. And people aren’t putting their minds to how we’re doing what is so important. It’s like you just occupy the uniform and put on the high browns and the Stetson, and people clap. There’s more to the job than just occupying the position. And that’s the cultural change I was after.

Rosenberg: I’d be remiss, Bob, if I didn’t ask you about your oath of office.

Paulson: Right.

Rosenberg: The oath that a young man or woman would take to become a Mountie.

Paulson: Yeah. And I’d sent you the oath from the Northwest Mounted Police. And the first oath is to the queen or the king.

Rosenberg: The head of state.

Paulson: The head of state. The other one, which is very interesting and is one that I always reminded people of, was this one, the oath of office, and it talks about, for example, Mr. Evans here, solemnly swore that he would faithfully, diligently and impartially execute and perform the duties required of him as a member of the Northwest Mounted Police, and will well and truly obey and perform all lawful orders and instructions which I shall receive as such, without fear, favour or affection of, or towards any person or party whomsoever. So, help him God. And my favorite part of that is the without fear, favour, or affection. And what that speaks to in terms of values and the qualities of effective leadership–I often maintain that one of the under-recognized or perhaps, mis-understood qualities is one of courage that leaders have to have and courage, not in the traditional sense of facing the lion, or wrestling bad guys, or getting into fights, but having the courage to live and think and be in a way that respects the values in the organization, and takes courage. And until you’re placed in those situations where you have to execute on that, I don’t think people understand how much courage it takes to make the right decision in the face of consequences

Rosenberg: And uncertainty.

Paulson: Yeah.

Rosenberg: So, this is an oath of allegiance taken by a gentleman named Warren Wells Evans. And I can’t quite read the date, but it’s April of 1890-something.

Paulson: Yeah. Yeah.

Rosenberg: Is it the same oath today?

Paulson: It’s a little different today.

Rosenberg: Does it still contain the fear, favour, or affection language?

Paulson: No, it doesn’t. They took it out which is which is sad and just diligently and honestly.

Rosenberg: But again, your obligation is not to a particular person or party, it’s to the law.

Paulson: Absolutely. To the rule of law. For police officers, you’ll always be faced with that. You’ll always have to choose. And for the most part, we all make the right decisions.

Rosenberg: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Bob, is, as we discussed, iconic, legendary. We know it in the United States. And we deeply respect it. As you said, it’s always had a very good relationship with the citizens of Canada. Do you miss it?

Paulson: Yeah, I miss–I miss the people. I miss doing the police work.

Rosenberg: Have you been able to get back into police work, Bob?

Paulson: Well, I wanted to, and one of the things that I did prior to leaving as commissioner, was I upped the reserve program because we we’re short of police officers.

Rosenberg: And so, after about six months of having left office, I rode over to the reserve office, and I sent them an application. Former Commissioner Bob Paulson as a reserve officer Paulson.

Paulson: Yeah. I didn’t tell anybody. I didn’t tell my wife. And so, I got a call from the deputy commissioner: “what’s going on?” I go: “what I. I just wanted to take a crack at it.” I understand. I’m probably not going to. Probably not gonna go there. But I do miss it. I do miss the work.

Rosenberg: Well, Bob, I’m really grateful for a couple of things for your remarkable service to the people of Canada as an officer, as a constable, and as a commissioner of the RCMP, but also for taking some time to sit down with us today and tell us about it. It’s a truly inspirational story.

Paulson: Well, thank you very much, Chuck. Thanks for the opportunity.

Rosenberg: It’s certainly our pleasure. Thank you for your time, Bob.

* A new national Quinnipiac poll found Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, 28% to 21%. (The previous Quinnipiac poll showed Warren with a more narrow, three-point advantage.) Bernie Sanders was third in the latest poll with 15%, and Pete Buttigieg was the only other candidate to reach double digits with a 10% showing.

* On a related note, Amy Klobuchar was sixth in the poll with 3%, which means the Minnesota senator has now qualified to participate in next month’s Democratic primary debate. For now, she’s one of nine candidates to meet the participation threshold.

* The latest Monmouth poll in South Carolina found Biden leading Warren, 33% to 16%, which is a much closer advantage than the same poll showed in July. Sanders is third in the poll with 12%.

* In Wisconsin, which is arguably the most important 2020 battleground state, the latest Marquette University Law School poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in the state by six points, 50% to 44%. The same results showed Sanders leading the president in the Badger State by two points, while Warren was up by one point. Marquette found Pete Buttigieg trailing Trump in a hypothetical matchup by two points.

* After briefly expressing tacit support for a presidential impeachment inquiry, Rep. Mark Amodei (R) has apparently lost his spot chairing Trump’s re-election campaign in Nevada.

* On a related note, though he wasn’t specific as to whom he was referring, Trump yesterday described his “Never Trump” Republican detractors as “human scum.”

* After Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) insisted that the Trump impeachment effort is a “lynching,” his Democratic rival, Jaime Harrison, raised $150,000 in one day for his 2020 campaign.

Elizabeth Warren enjoys a widening lead over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination — though another recent survey showed Biden holding the top spot.

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, grabs the support of 28 percent of Democrats and independent voters who lean toward the Democrats in a survey released Thursday by Quinnipiac University. Biden stands at 21 percent in the poll, with populist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 15 percent.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In Quinnipiac’s previous survey – conducted prior to the Oct. 15 fourth round Democratic debate – Warren had a slight 30-27 percent edge over Biden. But her advantage was within the poll’s margin of error. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid, was at 11 percent.

Quinnipiac’s new survey showing Warren with a clear lead outside the sampling error stands in stark contrast to a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS released a day earlier that suggested Biden at 34 percent, with Warren a distant second at 19 percent and Sanders at 16 percent. The former vice president’s 15 percentage point lead was his largest since April in CNN polling.

During the spring and summer Biden remained the unrivaled front-runner in the Democratic 2020 battle, but then Warren surged and has been tied with the former vice president in many national and early primary and caucus voting state polls this autumn.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg grabs 10 percent support in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 3 percent. According to Klobuchar’s campaign, their candidate has now reached the polling threshold and qualifies for the next debate, which will be held next month in Georgia.

No other candidate in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders topped 1 percent in the poll.

""Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement.

The survey indicates Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against President Trump in the 2020 election. But his electability has deteriorated, from a high of 56 percent days after he declared his candidacy in late April, to 42 percent now.

Thirty percent of those questioned say Warren has the best policy ideas, topping the rest of the field. And Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic White House contender, at 28 percent.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Among the nearly three-quarters of those polled who said they either watched October’s debate or paid close attention to news stories about it, 26 percent said Warren did the best job, followed by Buttigieg with 17 percent, Biden with 12 percent, Sanders at 11 percent, and Klobuchar at 8 percent. When asked who did the worst job in the recent debate, 15 percent said Biden and 11 percent said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

""Despite coming under attack at the debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren was viewed as doing the best job, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig, which may have helped his standing in the primary,” Snow said. ""Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Oct. 17 - 21, with 1,587 self-identified registered voters — including 713 Democratic voters and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of effort for Democratic primary questions is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

They're pulling from essentially the same strain of Democratic primary voters. Splitting that vote should dramatically weaken Warren's position in the field, but she is leading anyway.

So unless something unforeseen and dramatic happens between now and next spring -- and it could -- but if it doesn't, Elizabeth Warren will be the Democratic nominee. And that, as they say, has implications for all of us. There are her many terrible policy ideas -- Obviously we'll get to those in just a minute, but more immediately, there is Warren herself.

You're going to be seeing a lot of Elizabeth Warren over the next year. She'll be on your television screen nonstop. You will hear her voice rising from your car radio at red lights.

If you live in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina, you may find her in the flesh, loitering outside your Starbucks or waiting on your doorstep.

Prepare yourself because wherever there is Elizabeth Warren, there is falseness. Fake is who Warren is. She is authentically ersatz.

It turns out that pretending to be an Indian is not the least real thing Warren has ever done. She is always that synthetic, even when she is sitting around the kitchen, as seen in a video she was featured in earlier this year.

""I'll pass on the beer for now,"" says the off-camera figure -- who she says is her husband. It had to be an actor, right? No actual married couple could have an exchange that stilted. They'd have to be reading off cue cards, complete with intentionally bad grammar for that patina of middle-class authenticity.

Wherever there is Elizabeth Warren, there is falseness. Fake is who Warren is.

""I'm going to get me a beer,"" says the Harvard professor. Fetch me my Winston's. I'm hankering for a smoke. You have got to be kidding!

Except Elizabeth Warren isn't kidding. She expects you to believe every word of what she says, which means you're watching someone who will say literally anything. Whatever it takes.

In the primaries on the Democratic side, what it takes is maximum leftward pander. So that's what Warren has delivered this season. There's no issue in which she doesn't have the most radical possible position. And for now, it's working. Quinnipiac confirms that.

But how will Warren's positions on the issues play with the rest of the country in next fall's general election? Let's see.

On immigration, Warren wants to decriminalize all border crossings into this country. If that sounds crazy to you, you are hardly alone. Two-thirds of the country opposes that idea, too.

Warren also says she wants to abolish ICE, that's our federal immigration enforcement agency. How many Americans agree with her on that? Fewer than 25 percent agree with Elizabeth Warren on that.

Under her plan, we'd likely see a huge increase in illegal immigration, of course, and she has told us that every one of those foreign nationals is entitled to completely free health care, courtesy of you. How many Americans approve of that idea? Well, not that many, not surprisingly.

Though more than say they favor race-based reparations. And that's something else that Warren has called for. Sending people tax dollars based on their skin color is a genuinely unpopular idea in this country. But Warren doesn't seem to care.

As she has pointed out before, America is so racist, we deserve it.

Warren: We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice, racism, health care racism.

""Health care racism?!"" Hmm. You've got to wonder which bored teaching assistant in what mediocre state university thought up that phrase, ""health care racism"" -- and what it might mean.

Warren didn't bother to define it, of course. In her world, it is self-explanatory. You just add the word racism after any category of public policy, and all the ""woke"" kids nod in unison. ""Oh, health care racism. Yeah, man. It's systemic. This country was built on health care racism."" Of course, it was.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why we need ""Medicare-for-all."" It's a costly plan to be sure. But it's a plan that Elizabeth Warren -- because she is magic, being infused with the power of her ancestral Cherokee spirit animals -- can pay for without raising taxes on you, or anyone you know, or anyone you will ever meet. She can do that. She swears she can.

Marc Lacey, national editor for the New York Times/Democratic debate moderator: Will you raise taxes on the middle class for pay to pay for it? Yes or no?

Warren: No, it's how much are your costs?

Matthews: How --

Warren: It's how much -- it's how much families end up spending.

Matthews: I know that argument, but will you pay more in taxes? But why don't you want to answer that question? Because as Jake said tonight, that's a Republican talking point. It's not a Republican talking point. It's a question.

Warren: It's a question about where people are going to come out economically. Look --

Even the establishment media are getting fed up with her evasive answers.

Warren wants you to think she will only raise taxes on “the wealthy.” But her “Medicare-for-all” plan would impose massive tax increases on the middle class.

When questioned by the press as to whether her plan will involve higher middle-class taxes, Warren continues to bob and weave and dodge the question.

STUDY: EXORBITANT TAXES ON RICH AND CORPORATIONS WOULD COVER LESS THAN HALF OF 'MEDICARE FOR ALL'S' COSTS

In advance of the last debate by Democratic presidential candidates, Americans for Tax Reform released a video compilation of Warren’s middle-class tax dodges. It shows Warren dodging the question on at least 17 different occasions, all around the country. During the after the debate, she dodged the question another eight times.

Big media names on the left are growing exasperated as Warren refuses to level with them.

“Why don’t you want to answer the question?” said MSNBC’s Chris Matthews after trying to get an answer out of her on seven times in a row. Finally, he threw in the towel and said: “I’m not getting anywhere.”

During an interview with Stephen Colbert, Warren was asked: “How are you going to pay for it? Are you going to raise the middle-class taxes?""

As Warren ramped up her usual long-winded dodge, Colbert cut her off and said: “I've listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion for you about how you might defend the taxes that perhaps you're not mentioning.""

Even Warren’s Democratic primary opponents are finally calling her out. The day after the last debate, former Vice President Joe Biden said her evasiveness is raising questions about “whether or not she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people.”

Warren fashions herself a serious policy person who will level with the American people. But she’s just another tax-and-spend liberal who has a problem telling the truth.

As it turns out, Americans know they already pay enough in taxes. They also know the games Democrats play with tax rhetoric: A promise during the campaign to only raise taxes on a tiny part of the very wealthiest Scrooge McDucks.

But once in office, the Democratic politicians “discover” by golly that they, in fact, will be imposing tax increases on nearly everyone.

Warren has extraordinarily expensive big plans, funded courtesy of your wallet. Her plans will intrude into every aspect of American life.

It’s no wonder Warren has already endorsed a long list of tax increases including a carbon dioxide tax – a new national energy tax that will drastically increase costs for Americans.

A carbon tax is so toxic with voters that even the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign purposefully steered clear of it. Her campaign wrote an internal memo noting that a carbon tax would “disproportionately impact low-income households.”

Warren has also endorsed a 30 percent national gun tax, making it more expensive for households to protect themselves. Her gun tax plan has a deliberate goal of reducing gun ownership in the United States – an attempt to tax the Second Amendment out of existence.

Warren seems to have a problem telling the truth about her policies. But if she gets the Democratic nomination, there will be a historic contrast on taxes. Warren wants to raise your taxes. President Trump wants to cut taxes. Voters won’t be fooled."

The issue centers around whether such a plan, estimated to cost $32-34 trillion over 10 years, can be sufficiently funded without significant tax increases on the middle class.

Warren has been asked for an explanation 17 times on the campaign trail, ""America's Newsroom"" host Sandra Smith noted, including at a debate last week. She has vowed to ""soon"" release a detailed plan and claimed that health care costs for Americans will go down dramatically, blunting any tax hikes.

Payne said the $34 trillion is for ""Medicare-for-All"" but Warren has also promised many other ""goodies"" to voters. He said she now needs to ""pull a rabbit out of her hat"" or risk being ""boxed in"" on the issue.

""It may have to be a mea culpa,"" said Payne, wondering whether Warren will have to commit to a tax hike of some kind.

On the debate stage last week, Warren faced biting criticism from some of her rivals, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, who accused her of being dishonest about the plan's costs.

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued that “your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

O'Grady and a panel of experts broke down some of the biggest proposals coming out of the current field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and how the ideas can be financed.

""Let's take Elizabeth Warren. She's promising $40 to $50 trillion in new spending over the next 10 years,"" said Brian Riedl, an economic policy expert and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ""Let's assume $30 trillion of that can't come from the rich.""

STUART VARNEY ON KEEPING HOME HEATING BILLS DOWN THIS WINTER

""According to the Congressional Budget Office,"" continued Riedl. ""In order to raise $30 trillion, you would need either a payroll tax of 33 percent on top of the current 15 percent payroll tax. You're looking at about a 48 percent total payroll tax.""

""Or you could do a value-added tax, which is essentially a national sales tax, which is the other way Europe funds their welfare states,"" he suggested. ""You would need a 78 percent national sales tax to fund a $30 trillion agenda.""

""Are you saying that the government would take almost half of the income that your employer gives you? They would take that out even before you see that paycheck?"" asked O'Grady.

""That's correct. It would go from 15.3, which it is today, to nearly 50 percent for a payroll tax. That means ... nearly half of your paycheck would be taken out in the payroll tax. And of the remaining half, you're still paying the income tax. And when you go shopping, you're going to be paying sales tax. If there's a VAT tax, you're paying that. The cumulative effect of these taxes would be absolutely enormous,"" said Riedl.

""You can't get the proponents of these policies to talk openly about the taxes they require,"" he said, ""because once the American people find out what they cost, once they find out that Medicare-for-all isn't a free lunch -- support is going to collapse.""

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE'LL FINANCES 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

""They do talk about it,"" said Fox Business Network host David Asman, ""but in the most dishonest way, I mean, it's like Liz Warren saying: 'Come on two pennies for a billionaire. What is two pennies?'""

Senator Warren's Democratic colleagues have called her out for not being fully transparent about the costs of the government programs that she is touting.

During the last Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar took Warren to task, saying: ""At least [Sen. Bernie Sanders is] being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

The story -- titled “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’” -- said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against President Trump, citing Biden’s lackluster debate performance in Ohio last week.

""What does she have to lose at this point? She's run twice, she's lost twice, in one she won the popular vote. Her image is what her image is. In the words of a famous woman, what difference at this point would it make?"" he asked, referring to the former secretary of state's famous remark at a 2015 House hearing on the Benghazi attack.

BEN SHAPIRO: NOW IS THE TIME FOR HILLARY TO JUMP BACK IN

Shapiro pointed to Clinton becoming more vocal in recent weeks during a series of media appearances to promote a new book. He noted that Clinton went after 2020 candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, in the ""weirdest way,"" claiming the Iraq War veteran is a Russian asset.

Shapiro said the attack was ""exactly what [Gabbard] has been waiting for"" as she responded by calling Clinton ""the queen of warmongers"" and accusing her of being behind a campaign to sink her candidacy.

Overall, Shapiro said the Democratic presidential field, currently led by Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, is weak and Clinton sees an opportunity.

""Elizabeth Warren is weak,"" he said, noting that Warren's newly released education plan would ban federal funding for charter schools, claiming they're not competitive.

""What are you talking about?"" he asked, adding that ""if you're Hillary, you gotta be thinking 'maybe I ought to jump back in.'"""

But at least one family member who lost a loved one in the bloody massacre – in which a gunman killed 20 children and six adults – claims Biden is distorting the facts.

""The issue of gun violence has been a concern of mine for a long, long time,"" Biden says in the video. ""What really got to me though, really firsthand, was what happened up at Sandy Hook.

""I think I met with every one of the parents,"" he continues, ""and ... the families of those who were lost.""

But JT Lewis, 19, whose brother Jesse, 6, was killed in the attack, which happened just 11 days before Christmas, says former President Obama met with each of the grieving families after the Newtown shooting — not Biden.

SANDY HOOK FATHER AWARDED $450,000 IN DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR

“This is a lie,” Lewis writes in a Twitter message about Biden’s claim. “Obama came to Sandy Hook and met with every family. Joe Biden DID NOT.

“In fact,” Lewis adds, “my family was not allowed on Air Force One because we refused to support Obama/Biden gun control efforts.”

Biden addressed Sandy Hook family members June 15, 2016, CBS News reported, but it was unclear whether all families were represented.

In another post, Lewis reminds his followers of another instance in which Biden got his facts wrong regarding a school shooting.

He refers to an incident from August of this year, when Biden claimed to have been vice president at the time of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.

But the Parkland shooting happened in February 2018, more than a year after Biden had left the vice presidency.

“@JoeBiden is either a liar or he’s losing his mind,” Lewis concludes.

Gaffes have been one area of concern for the Biden campaign, which has been losing momentum in recent weeks. Other topics that have some supporters worried include increased scrutiny of Ukraine business dealings that involved Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE BOTHERED BY WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING TO TRUMP

Eric Trump said Democrats have been “embarrassed” twice already, referring to hearings with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, respectively, and thus are trying again with a “quid pro quo” angle regarding his father and Ukraine.

“Look what happened to Kavanaugh. Look what happened the embarrassment that was the Democratic Party during the Kavanaugh hearings,” Eric Trump told Hannity. “Look what happened in the Mueller hearings. That poster child went out there and he looked like an absolute buffoon. Didn't put together a sentence, very clear he didn't write the report, very clear he was getting marched around by the Democrats.”

He said Rep. Adam Schiff, D.-Calif., has been trying to impeach his father since he took his oath of office.

And the thresholds for the White House contenders to make the debate stage are once again rising.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The Democratic National Committee on Friday announced that the debate will be held on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. The DNC said that PBS NewsHour and Politico will co-host the showdown.

The debate will be the first held on the West Coast, and specifically California. The Golden State is playing a larger role this cycle in determining the Democratic presidential nominee. California moved up the date of its primary and will be the largest of the 15 states scheduled to vote on Super Tuesday, which will be held on March 3 of next year.

To make the cut for the Dec. 19 debate, candidates must now receive at least 4 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls or surveys in the early primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or hit at least 6 percent in two qualifying polls in the early voting states. Only polls released between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12 will be considered.

The DNC is also upping the fundraising threshold. Candidates will now have to hit campaign contributions from at least 200,000 individual donors – with a minimum of 800 unique contributors in at least 20 states or the District of Columbia.

The candidates have until Dec. 12 – one week before the debate – to hit the fundraising and polling criteria.

SOME 2020 DEMS FUME OVER DNC'S DEBATE CRITERIA

Nine candidates out of the remaining field of roughly 17 Democratic White House contenders say they’ve hit the lower thresholds to make the stage for next month’s fifth-round debate, which will be held Nov. 20 in Georgia. They are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, businessman and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Three candidates who reached the October debate stage are at risk of not qualifying for the November showdown. They are Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro of Texas, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, also of Texas.

The DNC’s qualifying criteria have been repeatedly criticized by many of the middle- and lower-tier candidates for months. Activists also argue that the job of narrowing the field belongs to the voters in the early-voting states rather than with national party leaders.

Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chairman Tom Perez told Fox News in September that the process has been “eminently fair” and added “we’re going “to continue to be transparent.”"

The independent senator and 2020 presidential primary contender announced on Thursday his plan to legalize marijuana by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House.

Sanders, whose home state of Vermont in 2018 legalized possession of one ounce of pot and let each adult resident grow two plants for personal use, has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide. He’s argued that the criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.

“Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Along with legalizing marijuana nationwide, Sanders also proposed expunging all past marijuana-related convictions and funneling some of the revenue from the legal marijuana business into communities hardest hit by the so-called War on Drugs.

“When we talk about criminal justice reform and ending institutional racism in America, we are talking about ending the disastrous War on Drugs, which has disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans,” his campaign said in a statement.

“It is time to admit the criminalization of marijuana was a disaster, especially for communities of color, and allow those most impacted to move forward with their lives. Our job now is to legalize marijuana and vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions, and ensure that revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in communities hit hardest by the War on Drugs.”

Legalizing marijuana has gone from a once-fringe issue to a mainstream topic of debate as more states have let residents buy and grow pot.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, while there are only nine states in the nation where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent poll from Gallup found that 66 percent of Americans supported fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.

The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.

While Sanders was the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates and senators such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records.

The only major candidates who haven’t supported full legalization: former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Biden said he supported decriminalization and rescheduling, criminal-record expungement and increased research access to marijuana, but argued it should be up to states to decide whether to legalize the drug. Klobuchar has said she supported decriminalization and legalization, but so far has not gone into specifics on her stance."

The event, to be co-hosted by The Washington Post on November 20, marks MSNBC's second debate gig this election cycle.

Maddow will be joined by MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker and Washington Post White House reporter Ashley Parker, an all-woman panel of moderators, the network said.

NBC raised eyebrows for including Maddow, who drew ratings for its cable network for pushing what critics have described as ""conspiracy theories"" during the two-year Russia investigation, as a debate moderator earlier this year as such a position is usually assigned to serious, unbiased journalists.

Maddow's debate performance was widely criticized for keeping much of her focus on the findings of then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

MSNBC OPINION HOST RACHEL MADDOW'S DEBATE PRESENCE WAS 'A LOSS FOR JOURNALISM,' CRITICS SAY

""One would think that NBC News, which purports to be a news organization, would go above and beyond to make sure its hosts’ line of questioning was fair and honest, especially given the backlash the network received for its decision to have a far-left pundit moderate a presidential debate,"" BlazeTV White House correspondent Jon Miller told Fox News.

Others slammed the ""conspiracy theorist"" on social media, saying her presence at a presidential debate was a ""disgrace.""

NBC has been under fire in recent weeks in the wake of the reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, who detailed the network's efforts to kill his Harvey Weinstein story and the alleged yearslong misconduct from its former star anchor Matt Lauer.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM'S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

Last week, a prominent women’s group called on the Democratic National Committee to pull its upcoming debate from MSNBC unless NBC News ""cleans house"" and launches an independent investigation into ""allegations of a culture of sexual abuse"" at the network.

UltraViolet Action, a leading national women’s organization, claimed the Democrats' fifth presidential debate shouldn’t happen if NBC didn't ditch its beleaguered leadership.

""The DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,"" UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement.

On Wednesday, a group of activists and sexual assault survivors from the organization held a protest outside NBC News' New York City headquarters.

The group called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and ""every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors"" at the Peacock Network.

""It's not just a Matt Lauer problem. It's a company-wide problem, and it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,"" Thomas said outside NBC’s famed 30 Rock.

BIDEN, FACING CASH CRUNCH, FLIPS ON SUPER PAC SPENDING

NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign effectively dropped its longstanding opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs on Thursday, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to try and lift him in the Democratic primary. The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals. … As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort. But on Thursday, Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, softened that stance… ‘Let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,’ Ms. Bedingfield said. ‘He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.’”



Biden still leads in Warren two-to-one in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner in the latest poll in South Carolina – which holds the first southern primary in the race for the White House. But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall. Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July. Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent.”



Dems nudge debate threshold to 4 percent for December - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates… To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early-voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early-state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or the District of Columbia.”



Bernie’s small-donor numbers padded by repeat contributions - WSJ: “The February day that Bernie Sanders began his second Democratic presidential campaign, Christine Peloza gave him $27, the amount Mr. Sanders often boasted was the average donation in his first run. Then, she kept giving, in $3 increments, clicking donate up to 20 times a day. By the end of June, Ms. Peloza, a 34-year-old office manager at an elderly care facility in Illinois, had donated more than 850 times to Mr. Sanders… The Sanders campaign laid claim to the majority of these ‘super donors,’ the Journal found, with about 1,000 of them. The other Democrats in the race combined for at least 650 ultra-repeat givers, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had at least 125. And President Trump’s re-election campaign, which began in 2017, has at least 250.”



Gabbard, facing dimming House hopes, drops re-election bid - Reuters: “Tulsi Gabbard, the last House member still in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Thursday she would not seek reelection for her Hawaii seat. ‘I believe I can best serve the people of Hawaii and our country as your President and Commander-in-Chief,’ she said in an announcement posted on Twitter. Gabbard’s decision clears the way for Hawaii State Senator Kai Kahele, who announced a primary challenge against her this spring. ‘I wholly respect and appreciate Congresswoman Gabbard’s decision not to pursue re-election for her Congressional seat as she pursues the Presidency,’ Kahele said in a tweet.”

TIME OUT: LASTING LEGACY

WAMU: “There have been several stories recently highlighting the last time a Washington baseball team won a World Series. The answer most given is the Senators in 1924. Now, it’s true that the Senators were Washington’s last major league baseball team to win a World Series. But there was another very successful team to come afterward. The Homestead Grays won three Negro League World Series titles. … Now, there are plenty of reasons why baseball enthusiasts would disagree with this argument. They might say that the Grays were not exclusively a Washington team. They were founded in Pittsburgh in 1912 and didn’t start splitting time until 1940. … Like many Negro League teams, the Homestead Grays did not have a dedicated field. … Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith saw a financial benefit to letting the Grays play some of their games at his stadium in D.C.… Thus, the team became the Washington Homestead Grays.”

IMPEACHMENT WOES FOR SWING STATE GOP SENATORS

NYT: “Senate Republicans facing steep re-election races next year know the impeachment inquiry coursing steadily ahead on the other side of the Capitol will determine President Trump’s political fate. Their growing fear is that it will also determine their own. In a matter of weeks, those few senators have watched helplessly as the investigation by House Democrats has lobbed a grenade into the middle of their campaigns, putting them on the defensive amid a torrent of damaging revelations about the president’s conduct with no clear end in sight. It has tightened the squeeze they were already feeling between a political base that demands unquestioning loyalty to Mr. Trump, and the moderate swing voters who may very well decide their elections. And it is one reason that support for the president in the Republican-led Senate appears to be subtly softening, a phenomenon that some of his own advisers fear that Mr. Trump does not fully appreciate.”



Big bucks for Trump re-elect not trickling down to Senate runs - RCP: “President Donald Trump is raising record amounts of cash for his 2020 reelection. But that fundraising might isn’t spilling over to the most vulnerable Republicans fighting to hold onto their seats in a narrowly divided Senate. During the third quarter, former astronaut Mark Kelly took in $2.5 million more than Republican Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. In Maine, state House Speaker Sara Gideon bested longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins by over $1 million. And in Colorado, Cory Gardner, who led Senate Republicans’ campaign arm in 2018, barely outraised former Gov. John Hickenlooper, who had been in the race just five weeks before the quarter ended. The trouble for Republicans extends to states where they’re supposed to be on firmer ground. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst didn’t crack $1 million and was outraised by the leading Democrat. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis narrowly outraised Democrat Cal Cunningham…”



OBAMA ON CUMMINGS: BEING STRONG MEANS BEING KIND

ABC News: “The funeral for Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings took place in his hometown of Baltimore Friday morning. ‘Elijah Cummings came from good soil,’ former President Barack Obama said in his eulogy. ‘A leader who once said he’d die for his people even as he lived every minute for them. His life validates the things we tell ourselves about what’s possible in this country -- not guaranteed, but possible.’ Obama went on to say that while hearing Cummings’ daughters speak at the funeral, ‘I was thinking I’d want my daughters to know how much I love them, but I’d also want them to know that being a strong man also means being kind, that there’s nothing weak about kindness and compassion. There’s nothing weak about looking out for others. There’s nothing weak about being honorable. You’re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Per your response to a question From the Bleachers in [Thursday’s] Report, Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that conviction post-impeachment can result in permanent disqualification from any federal office. My recollection is that this is an issue apart from mere conviction/removal—an additional punishment the Senate may, but need not confer. Apart from that, I suppose technically anyone can RUN for President, but if subsequent to conviction and with this disqualification applied, s/he would, if somehow elected, be legally barred from actually taking office. Love your Reports, and your appearances on FNC!” – Doug Chamberlain, Hooksett, N.H.



[Ed. note: Quite right you are. The Senate could apply that further sanction. I should have been clear on that point! Thank you for pointing it out.]



“Most batches or degrees do not prepare the recipient to do anything except further education. Taxpayer tuition is for the schools/universities, not students. Maybe ‘free’ tuition for a trade school would benefit the student and the community. I have two graduate degrees and have taught college level courses.” – Jim Fullilove, Shreveport, La.



[Ed. note: America has a most distressing educational problem. College graduation rates continue to rise while high-school graduation rates continue to fall. This is a reflection of a society in which a broad elite – maybe 30 percent of the country – sees increasingly better outcomes, while the remainder is falling farther behind. It strikes me that the important work ought to be done in improving secondary education before we just punt the problem into additional years of universal education.]

To this day, I – who travel the roads often for business – can almost always find my comfort food, the microwave burrito, at any hour at any convenience store. It is the perfect culinary treat, containing every food group, … and prepared ‘fresh’ in an aged microwave found buried at the back of the store with pre-set numbered times - as to which you must simply guess. The cheese, beans and other contents are irregularly heated in wonderful patches, and the corners of the flour tortilla without moisture become perfectly crunchy (or just hard). The last salty savory bite from the bottom of the slightly melted plastic wrapper is like the last Oreo in a pack, and it compels you to wonder how much longer to the next highway exit or rest stop, where you might consider getting just one more. Comparing this oasis treat with unproductive party primaries and anti-constitutional, anti-‘democratic republic’ zanies is just wrong.” – Ken Levine, Lionville, Pa.

MAYBE TRY FROOT LOOPS AFTER YOUR NEXT COMMUTE

UPI: “Researchers in Virginia said they trained rats to drive tiny cars and learned the activity was a means of stress relief for the rodents. The scientists at the University of Richmond's Lambert Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory said they trained two groups of rats to operate the ‘rat-operated vehicle,’ or ROV, which works by having the rats push down on a copper bar that propels the tiny car forward. The rats were rewarded with Froot Loops cereal when they drove to the end of the enclosure. Kelly Lambert, head of the laboratory and lead author of the story … said researchers analyzed the rats' droppings and found both groups of rodents had an increase in hormones that control stress responses. … Lambert said the study could have implications for how researchers approach depression and other mental illnesses in humans.”

WHAT WILL WE MAKE OF OUR MOMENT?

Periods of political upheaval can be wonderful things. Needed changes once deemed politically impossible suddenly become realities. Old superstitions and their totems can finally be discarded.



But it’s never all good.



The tumult of the first half of the 1970s is instructive. After that period, which included the resignations of the vice president and then president over corruption and abuses of power, Washington ushered in much-needed ethics reforms. Congress cracked down on payola for members and mandated financial disclosure for itself and the other two branches.



But that same era resulted in the birth of the modern political primary system that wreaks increasing damage on the republic cycle after cycle. Getting rid of smoke-filled rooms may have decreased the power of party bosses, but has introduced more demagoguery – both fanatical and fantastical – to our public life.



Like last-call shots of Fireball, microwave burritos and men in skinny jeans, it sounded like a good idea at the time.



As the parties clash this time in Washington, we don’t know what the era to come will bring. Which will be the positive changes to laws and attitudes born from this era of political chaos unseen four decades? Which will be ones that linger like a Fireball hangover?



With this in mind, consider the offering from today’s WaPo: “The Constitution isn’t the cure for President Trump. It is the cause.” by Shira Lurie, a history professor at the University of Toronto who formerly taught at the University of Virginia.



We encourage you to read her piece to get a fuller understanding of the argument, but her basic effort is to caution those involved in the struggle to either oust or constrain President Trump by constitutional means are simultaneously deepening our esteem for our flawed founding charter.



“Democrats can and should seek a constitutional remedy to remove Trump,” she writes. “But we need to confront the idea that a president who lost the popular vote by millions, deceives the public, attacks the press and does not have the confidence of the majority of Americans may not be a distortion of the constitutional order, but a feature.”



We wondered whether to even call attention to the piece lest we be guilty of that version of straw man argument that The Dispatch’s David French has delightfully dubbed “nut picking.” That’s when you find a fringe character from an opposing point of view and drag them forward to suggest that some far-flung idea is really mainstream.



Lurie is not in the political mainstream. In fact, she acknowledges it by expressing concern that Democrats are expressing excessive reverence for the Constitution.



“Worshiping the Constitution as a sacred text is not patriotism, it’s fanaticism,” she warns. “We can continue to pray to it, but it won’t save us. It is high time to address the anti-democratic foundations of American government.”



But we fear that the bipartisan reverence for our founding is actually pretty surficial these days. Leaders in both parties are closer to Lurie than she knows.



When the executive branch shows absolute contempt for the clearly stated powers of the legislative branch in a letter that sounds like it was dictated by Huey Long from a balcony you don’t get that good ol’ separation-of-powers tingle.



When Democratic presidential candidates willy-nilly offer proposals that ignore not only those same separations but doing so using the kind of cheap demagoguery that defies the principles of both the Constitution and the Declaration, one doesn’t feel the gentle breezes of a return to Madisonian democracy.



Our era will produce substantial change for the generations to come. Whatever shape that takes, we would do better to avoid the mistakes of the past and use our era to strengthen, not diminish, the Constitution that has seen us through this and all of our previous crises.

TIME OUT: DEMOCRATIC DUNGAREES

Atlantic: “If you want to sell clothes in America, it helps a lot if buyers think your product is cool. Jeans have a backstory that any marketer would kill for. ‘Denim first became popular in the 1920s and 1930s in tandem with the rise of Hollywood,’ explains Emma McClendon, an associate curator at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who orchestrated a denim retrospective at the museum in 2015. … Over the years, the cuts and washes changed, but denim’s position as a relatively democratic element of the wardrobes of stylish, influential people didn’t. … In the past, only one or two styles of jeans were “cool” at a given time. … Now denim inventory is as infinite as the internet itself. Fast-fashion retailers update their selections constantly, which means that nearly every type of denim is available simultaneously. Depending on whom you ask, the big thing right now might be mom jeans.”

GRAHAM SET TO SQUEEZE FELLOW GOPERS WITH SHOW VOTE

AP: “GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President Donald Trump, is introducing a resolution condemning the Democratic-controlled House for pursuing a ‘closed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry.’ Graham announced the move Thursday and says the Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, is a co-sponsor. Graham plans a Thursday afternoon news conference. The nonbinding resolution gives Senate Republicans a chance to show support for Trump at a moment when Trump is urging his GOP allies to get tougher and fight harder for him as the House impeachment probe gathers momentum. Many Senate Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach amid the House impeachment inquiry. Rather than commenting on the substance of the probe, they are united in complaining that the House is taking depositions from witnesses behind closed doors.”



Some senators are keeping impeachment thoughts to themselves - Politico: “[Susan Collins] is among a group of senators from both parties who are increasingly citing their role as possible jurors in an impeachment trial. They argue that as impartial jurors, they shouldn't make any foregone conclusion — especially about a scandal that could force Trump out of office. … Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee agrees, saying jurors shouldn’t be ‘running around announcing their decision until they’ve heard the arguments.’ … The reserved nature of Republicans like Alexander, who is retiring, and the moderate Collins suggests some in the president's own party are legitimately open to Democrats' arguments — an ominous sign for Trump… It also has the added side benefit of excusing senators from the noisy, day-to-day chaos of the president’s investigation by Congress.”



Dems prepare to go public with probe - WaPo: “House Democrats are preparing to move their largely private impeachment inquiry onto a more public stage as soon as mid-November and are already grappling with how best to present the complex Ukraine saga to the American people. Over the past three weeks, a parade of current and former Trump administration officials have testified behind closed doors, providing House investigators with a compelling narrative of President Trump’s campaign to extract political favors from Ukrainian officials. … Among the witnesses Democrats hope to question in open session are the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., and his predecessor, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Both are seasoned diplomats who, in earlier House testimony, effectively conveyed outrage over a White House plan to withhold much-needed military aid from Ukraine…”



Wisconsin sees increase in support for impeachment - Marquette University: “A new Marquette Law School poll of Wisconsin registered voters finds that 46 percent think that there is enough cause now for Congress to hold hearings on impeachment of President Donald Trump, while 49 percent say there is not enough cause and 5 percent say they do not know. In April 2019, 29 percent said there was sufficient reason for impeachment hearings and 65 percent said there was not. The April poll was completed after Attorney General William Barr’s letter describing the Mueller report but before the report was publicly released. Earlier, in January 2019, 33 percent supported and 59 percent opposed hearings.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Loyalty to the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano questions President Trump’s relationship to upholding the Constitution: “After a weekend of torrential criticism, Trump announced that he had changed his mind and said he would not host the G-7 meeting at the Miami area resort. Yet, in the process of doing so, he characterized the Emoluments Clause as ‘phony.’ Who knows what he meant by phony? The clause is in the Constitution and it means what it says. Yet, whatever Trump meant by phony, it constituted at least a disparagement of the Constitution he has sworn to uphold and at worst a threat to ignore clauses he can disparage. This is most unusual and potentially dangerous, and it raises the question: Can the president lawfully enforce only the clauses of the Constitution with which he agrees and ignore those with which he disagrees? In a word: No.” More here.



Q POLL: WARREN AHEAD, BUT WORRIES ABOUT ELECTABILITY

Quinnipiac University: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has opened up a lead in the Democratic primary race after being locked in a tight race with former Vice President Joe Biden for several weeks, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 28 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 15 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 10 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris is at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar is at 3 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. … Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election… In today's poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll… Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent.”



Biden really slipping in fundraising pack - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is drawing more support from big-ticket donors than any other candidate in the race — yet he still can’t match his rivals’ cash flow. Biden has raised $20.7 million from contributions of at least $500 — $1.5 million more than his nearest competitor, despite entering the race later than all of them — thanks to the former vice president’s strong connections and goodwill among the traditional donors who have long financed the Democratic Party. … But it’s been nowhere near enough to make Biden the leader of the fundraising pack. In fact, his big-dollar dominance, and his reliance on those donors, is more evidence of how quickly small-dollar donations have become the most important component of political fundraising in a sprawling, fractured Democratic race. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are all outraising Biden, and stockpiling cash significantly faster than him, on the back of major support from online donors that Biden has been unable to build.”



Tim Ryan bows out - NBC News: “Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, ended his long-shot presidential campaign after months of struggling to find a footing in the crowded Democratic field. Ryan announced his decision to end his campaign in a video to supporters, stating he would run again for his House seat. He isn’t throwing his support behind anyone in the 2020 field at this time, his campaign told NBC. ‘I got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country: the workers who have been left behind, the businesses who have been left behind, the people who need health care or aren’t getting a quality education, or are saddled by tremendous debt,’ Ryan said. 'I'm proud of this campaign because I believe we’ve done that. We’ve given voice to the forgotten communities and the forgotten people in the United States.'""



Moderators announced for November debate - NBC News: “The fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia will have four moderators, MSNBC announced on Wednesday — and all of them are women. Moderating the Nov. 20 event, which is being co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will be Rachel Maddow, host of ‘The Rachel Maddow Show’ on MSNBC; Andrea Mitchell, host of ‘Andrea Mitchell Reports’ on MSNBC and NBC News' chief foreign affairs correspondent; Kristen Welker, NBC News' White House correspondent; and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. The debate will likely feature a smaller lineup of candidates than the dozen who qualified for October's debate in Ohio — only eight candidates have qualified for the debate stage so far, according to an unofficial NBC News tally. It will also be shorter than the three-hour October debate — it's scheduled to air from 9 to 11 p.m. ET.”



BORIS JOHNSON LAUNCHES BID FOR DECEMBER ELECTION

Fox News: “Boris Johnson will launch an attempt to hold a general election in Britain on December 12 to ‘get Brexit done.’ The British prime minister will attempt to convince members of Parliament to formally back the bid on Monday, but he will need the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons. Britain's next scheduled election is not until 2022. Johnson's move comes after his Brexit bill was finally passed earlier this week, but lawmakers defeated his request to push through the legislation in a three-day timetable, saying it didn't provide enough time for scrutiny. He said he expected the European Union to grant an extension to his October 31 deadline, likely to be to the end of January. The EU is expected to give its verdict on an extension on Friday. The prime minister said the Dec. 12 date will give lawmakers time before the election to scrutinize his Brexit bill. Under his plan, Parliament would remain working until Nov. 6, when campaigning would start.”

AUDIBLE: AMEN

“Back in 2015, his city roiled by unrest, by day the congressman was here in the Capitol working and leading in these hallways of power. But every night he rode the train back home and walked the neighborhoods, bullhorn in hand, encouraging unity and peace. Here’s what he said: ‘Let’s go home. Let’s all go home.’ Now our distinguished colleague truly has gone home, home to his Father’s house.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in his condolences for Rep. Elijah Cummings as he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol Thursday.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Without asking you to necessarily weigh in on the ‘wisdom’ of same (unless of course you want to), I have two ‘technical’ and hypothetical impeachment questions: If a president is impeached and IS convicted in the Senate, is he/she eligible to run for re-election? (Somewhat similar situation to Marion Barry in Washington, D.C.) If a president is impeached but is NOT convicted in the Senate, could the House vote to re-impeach the president the next day (perhaps even ad infinitum) in a political ground hog day?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: Most certainly, Mr. Wittnebert. President Trump could be removed from office and seek the presidency a second time, and he could be acquitted in the Senate and be re-impeached. But you’d have to think either scenario would be vanishingly rare. We talk often about impeachment being a political, not legal proposition. But that applies to its aftermath, too. If Trump becomes such a boat anchor that Senate Republicans feel obliged to cut ties with him, it will be because he is too great a political liability/embarrassment. If he is let off by the Senate, House Democrats will move urgently to pivot away from what will almost certainly be a somewhat embarrassing anti-climax.]



“I'm doing a bit of head scratching over what I see as competing information. By this I mean that I'm seeing President Trump's approval rating on a swift downhill slide and at the same time I'm hearing that the Democrats are hand-wringing over whether they have a candidate that can defeat him in 2020. Who needs to be more concerned?” – Neil Klapthor, Evans, Ga.



[Ed. note: The one who’s trailing a year from today! I kid, I kid… mostly. The past three weeks have been brutal for Trump, partly because of Democrats’ closing ranks and prosecuting their impeachment with vigorous determination. But it’s mostly been self-inflicted. Will the trend continue? Almost certainly not. It may get worse for the incumbent over time if further revelations drive a wedge between Trump and the GOP or it may get worse for Democrats because their own penchant for infighting will re-emerge. I suspect it will probably be quite a bit of both. But there are other considerations, particularly the health of the economy in the first two quarters of 2020. Given how much farther this river runs, it’s probably best to sail with the current for now and enjoy the view. We won’t find out who’s going over Niagara for a while yet.]

A PUMPKIN SPICE FLOAT

WTVC: “Around this time of year, most people take to carving pumpkins. But a farmer in Cleveland, Tennessee took things one step further. Justin Ownby grew a massive pumpkin that weighed 910 pounds… But he was not satisfied merely by its ornamental delights that enhance the season. Ownby's wife Christin Ownby shared video with WTVC that shows Ownby hollowed out the pumpkin, and converted to a buoyant watercraft that he tested on his farm's pond. A second video has someone off camera asking him to do his impression of ‘Washington crossing the Delaware!,’ and Ownby stands up as the pumpkin submerges under the sudden weight. Ownby says Justin used a seed to grow the pumpkin that came from a record-breaking pumpkin grown in Tennessee that weighed more than 1,700 pounds. … Christin Ownby says the pumpkin remains floating in the pond at last check, saying ‘It will make a great snack for the catfish!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“When I was growing up, I thought ‘gyp’ was simply a synonym for ‘cheat,’ and used it accordingly. It was only when I was an adult that I learned that gyp was short for gypsy. At which point, I stopped using it. … Why? Simple decency. … It’s a question not of who or how many had their feelings hurt, but of whether you want to associate yourself with a word that, for whatever historical reason having nothing to do with you, carries inherently derogatory connotations.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Oct. 17, 2013.

Clinton in recent weeks has privately stated she would enter the 2020 presidential race if she were certain she could win, The New York Times reported Tuesday.

Ingraham spoke of the weakness among the Democratic frontrunners, in particular former Vice President Joe Biden.

""The walking, talking gaffe-a-matic machine known as Joe Biden may have dropped in the polls for a few weeks, but now he's back on top. And what seems to be the grudging recognition that the other top candidates, Warren and Sanders, are just not going to cut it in key battleground states where common sense still means something,"" Ingraham said. ""I mean, who doesn't think that Hillary is a stronger candidate than that goofball Biden.""

The host made the case for why Clinton may be a possibility.

""She has instant name recognition, a massive fundraising apparatus that could be reactivated, and her old campaign team would quickly reconstitute,"" Ingraham said.

Ingraham laid out what could be pushing Clinton to run and what could also be stopping her.

""Of course, Hillary is smart enough to know that the only thing worse than losing once to Donald Trump would be losing twice to him. And that, too, is a distinct possibility."""

Is 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton seriously mulling a third stab for the White House?

Clinton’s own comments and actions in recent weeks sparked the Washington buzz, fueling stories that she could possibly enter her party’s nomination race at this late date amid complaints from some Democratic Party insiders who view the current field of contenders too weak or progressive to take on President Trump next year.

LONGTIME HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER REFUSES TO RULE OUT A CLINTON 2020 BID

Clinton even indirectly took aim at Trump on Friday during the nationally televised memorial service for the late Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who has vocally clashed with the president.

Comparing Cummings to the prophet Elijah, Clinton said to loud applause that “like that Old Testament prophet, he stood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.""

Longtime top Clinton adviser Philippe Reines also fueled the flames, saying in interviews this week with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson and Dana Perino that his old boss had not closed the door on a 2020 bid.

He told Carlson Clinton hasn't closed the door to running, saying she would ""think about it long and hard"" if she thought she had the best odds of beating Trump — while still calling the scenario unlikely.

“I think it’s somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it’s not zero. I don’t know how to be more honest than that,” Reines said Thursday on Fox News' ‘Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.’

“To the extent that I talk to her about the race and just in general what she’s up to, I do think she’s been looking and watching wistfully, which is totally understandable given the race she went through in 2016,” Reines said.

The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee, has essentially remained in the spotlight ever since losing the 2016 election to Trump — yet winning the national popular vote.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

But her comments and actions in recent weeks have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level, renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has presidential ambitions despite past claims to the contrary.

The latest episodes include Clinton tweeting “Don’t tempt me” in response to Trump's suggestion about running in 2020; mocking Trump’s interactions with foreign leaders; and arguing without evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a “Russian asset” — a swipe that injected her into the 2020 primary battle, even from the sidelines.

A top aide downplayed the 2020 speculation, however.

“The short of it is that she’s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,” longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told Fox News earlier this week. “It’s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it’s as simple as that. She’s out there telling the truth.”

CLINTON MULLING WHITE HOUSE BID, CITING WEAK FIELD, ACCORDING TO REPORTS

But the story went viral on Tuesday, with a New York Times report that Clinton in recent weeks stated she would declare her candidacy if she were certain she would win the race.

The article, headlined “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’,” noted that about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City raised concerns whether former Vice President Joe Biden – a co-front-runner – could stand strong against Trump, and worried about his fundraising struggles and the need to defend his son Hunter Biden over business dealings in Ukraine amid the House impeachment inquiry into the president. Those gathered also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were likely too liberal to win the general election.

An adviser close to the Biden world, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said the former vice president’s camp is not taking the media reports seriously and they continue to “move ahead.”

And in the crucial first primary state of New Hampshire, a top Democrat says concern with the field and a hunger for another candidate is not a topic of conversation that she's heard.

“I’ve heard nothing about people wishing someone else would get into the race,” said Kathy Sullivan, a longtime Democratic National Committee member and former New Hampshire Democratic party chair.

Sullivan, who backed Clinton in the 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns, told Fox News, “I’m not taking this seriously. I love Hillary Clinton and I think she’d be a fantastic president but there is a lot of really good people running for president right now. I think it’s too late in the day for someone to get into the race. I don’t take it seriously and I don’t think it’s a good idea and we don’t need to have anyone else in the race right now.”

It is getting late in the game, especially in New Hampshire, where Nov. 15 is the last day for a candidate to file to get their name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot.

And a longtime Democratic veteran of over 10 New Hampshire primaries noted that “we’ve seen this before. It’s not an uncommon Democratic trait to long for someone who is not in the race. It’s like pre-buyer’s remorse. Shopper's remorse.”

Bernie Sanders’ campaign on Thursday accused Joe Biden of selling out to big donors in an effort to “buy the election” following reports that the former vice president and frontrunner for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination would form a super PAC to accept unlimited donations from billionaires and corporate elites to cure his current fundraising woes.

A spokesperson for Biden’s campaign responded Thursday evening, telling Fox News in a statement that, in the eyes of President Trump, “the general election has already begun,” and Democrats must use any means possible within the parameters of current federal elections laws to win back the presidency — even if that includes taking money from corporations and billionaires alike.

TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING CASH HAUL REPORTEDLY RATTLING DEMOCRATS

""Joe Biden has spent his campaign promising elite donors that nothing will fundamentally change for them, and he has made clear to fossil fuel and pharmaceutical donors that he will be their ally,” Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. “As a result, he has had trouble generating significant grassroots support from Americans who are getting crushed by those same big donors — and so his supporters are suddenly begging for help from super PACs, even though they are vehicles for the kind of corporate corruption that Democrats should be fighting to stop.”



""Let’s be clear: super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors,” he continued. “Every Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs -- and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy.”

Biden, who’s trailing his Democratic rivals in fundraising, said when he first announced his candidacy in April that he would not accept money from super PACs. The former U.S. senator from Delaware declared he was committed to driving perceived ""dark money"" from politics.

Before entering the 2020 race, Biden told PBS NewsHour in January 2018 that he was the one who told Sanders not to accept super PAC money, arguing he would lose the trust of the middle class.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN RESPONDS TO BIDEN’S ’60 MINUTES’ INTERVIEW, TAKES SWIPE AT HUNTER

“My positions are a hell of a lot closer to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on some of the economic positions,” Biden told PBS’s Judy Woodruff last year. “I mean, I sat with Bernie. I'm the guy that told him you shouldn't accept any money from a super PAC because people can't possibly trust you.”

Within the third quarter, Biden’s campaign raised $15.2 million but was left with just $9 million after expenditures, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign, which welcomes super PAC contributions, and the Republican Party together raised $125 million in that same time period for the president’s re-election, according to the Republican National Committee. Using these funds, Trump's campaign paid for attack ads targeting Biden amid an ongoing Democratic-led House impeachment inquiry against the president.

While Biden’s campaign this week softened its stance on accepting super PAC donations, Sanders boasted his bid for the presidency is 100 percent grassroots funded. Biden’s campaign told Fox News on Thursday that he is still committed to eradicating private donations from federal elections — but until he becomes president, is open to big-donor contributions to defeat Trump.

“As president, Joe Biden will push to remove private money from our federal elections. He will advocate for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United [a 2010 Supreme Cout decision on campaign financing] and end the era of unbridled spending by Super PACs,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told Fox News.

“Until we have these badly needed reforms, we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to re-elect this corrupt president,” she continued. “And let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided the general election has already begun. In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency. Nothing changes until we defeat Donald Trump.”"
