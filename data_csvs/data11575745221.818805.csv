I’m generally sympathetic to Joe Biden as a person and think that in most respects his administration would be hard to distinguish from a third Obama term. He’d staff the government with good, decent, well-meaning and competent people and he’d do his honest best to be a president America could take pride in. I’m not sure a third Obama term is what the country really needs right now, or that that is the best we can do, or that Biden would perform nearly as well as Obama when it came time to make the really hard decisions. I’m not even sure, at his age, if he’s up for the challenge. But I’m not hostile to Joe Biden. Except, perhaps, when I hear him talk about Republicans as if they’re people who can be reasoned with or partnered with in good faith negotiations.

Biden on getting things done post Trump: ""With Donald Trump out of the way, you’re going to see a number of my Republican colleagues have an epiphany. Mark my words. Mark my words,” — Liz Goodwin (@lizcgoodwin) November 6, 2019

One way or another, the Republicans will one day be free of Donald Trump, and they will change as a result. But the main way political parties change is through the churn of elections. Their vulnerable members are the most likely to be interested in bipartisanship, but they’re also the first to lose. The Democrats didn’t become more interested in working with Trump when centrist senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Donnelly of Indiana lost their reelection bids. The same thing is happening on a greater scale to the GOP as the Democrats continue to pick off lawmakers who come from competitive states and districts. If Joe Biden wins a resounding victory over Trump, he will also probably see many of the likeliest Republican partners for bipartisan legislation bounced out of office at the same time. And, honestly, there aren’t many partnering candidates to begin with.

It’s true that when political parties lose consistently and for a long time, they can begin to moderate their positions and move to the center. This is basically what happened with the Democrats in the early nineties. But, as the anti-government party, the Republicans are more comfortable being in the opposition than the Democrats. They spent about sixty years in a near perpetual congressional minority between 1933 and 1995. What finally brought them out of the wilderness wasn’t moderation but the triumph of the radical conservative movement. They seem more than happy to lose elections if the alternative is to work with Democrats.

If anything, the possibility of bipartisanship is more remote than ever. First, the Democrats have very few conservative members left in Congress, so there’s no longer much ideological overlap to work with. Second, the rise of right-wing media has brought along an extremely strong enforcement mechanism for highlighting and punishing any softness or compromise from Republican officeholders, very much including their leadership.

I have no doubt a President Biden would have a vastly more cordial relationship with Senate Republicans than a President Warren or Sanders or Harris. But they’d still feel compelled to oppose him at every turn because personal relationships can only help on things that have very low visibility to the enforcers at Fox News and other conservative media outlets.

President Biden would not find a receptive Republican audience for any part of his platform in Congress. More likely, the GOP would change their position on an issue rather than maintain it if was consistent with Biden’s view. They would characterize everything he proposed as radical and budget-busting and in the service of non-white welfare cheats. They would shut down the government and default on the national debt to extract the maximum amount of concessions.

This isn’t just a problem for Biden. Things would be basically the same but more heated if the next president pushed a more progressive agenda. No one can magically fix the Republican Party or make its members cooperative. No one can enact their agenda under the present rules because the Republicans will have the power to block almost all substantive legislation.

But Biden keeps saying that he’s got the magic touch. It’s somewhere between insulting and dishonest to hear him talk about the Republicans having an “epiphany” if he becomes president. This is a party that is sticking with a criminal and incompetent and immoral and reckless president because, like Israel’s right-wing Likud Party, they don’t turn on their leaders.

I wish Biden were right. But I’ve been blogging for about 15 years now, and all that time I’ve been saying that the Republicans are far worse than most people understand or are prepared to admit. And they have kept proving me correct over and over and over again. They aren’t going to reverse course and get better. What they’re going to do, eventually, is circle the drain for long enough that they’re flushed into the annals of history."

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg considered a presidential campaign in 2008. And 2012. And then again in 2016.

In each instance, things didn’t quite work out for the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, and six months ago, Bloomberg conceded that he wouldn’t be a candidate in the 2020 election cycle, either. “I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election,” he wrote in column announcing his decision not to run. “But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

Evidently, the former mayor now sees a different landscape through those clear eyes.

Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg is positioning himself to enter the Democratic presidential primary, a longtime Bloomberg adviser confirmed to NBC News Thursday, though he has not yet made a final decision. “Yes and yes,” Kevin Sheekey wrote in an email responding to the questions about whether Bloomberg, 77, a billionaire businessman, was preparing to run and collecting signatures in Alabama, moves first reported by The New York Times on Thursday afternoon.

The Alabama angle may seem unexpected – it’s a ruby-red state that is unlikely to play a major role in the election – but it’s the state with the earliest filing deadline. In fact, that deadline is today, which is why, as the New York Times’ report put it, Bloomberg is “expected to file paperwork this week designating himself as a candidate in at least one state.” (The filing deadline in New Hampshire is a week from today, and by any fair measure, it’s of greater electoral importance.)

According to the former mayor’s spokesperson, Howard Wolfson, Bloomberg’s principal concern is that the current field of Democratic presidential hopefuls isn’t strong enough to defeat Donald Trump, which apparently led Bloomberg to reconsider his decision.

Complicating matters, he’s not alone: the Washington Post’s Eugene Robinson noted late yesterday that he spoke to a reliable source who told him former Attorney General Eric Holder “has been consulting strategists” about also possibly jumping into the 2020 presidential race.”

So, let’s take stock.

Right off the bat, the idea that the current field of Democratic presidential hopefuls appears likely to struggle in a general election is suspect. It was, after all, just this week that several national polls found Trump trailing the top Democratic candidates by margins ranging from 8 to 17 points.

If those numbers were reversed, and the Republican enjoyed healthy leads, the rationale for a “white knight” to storm in and rescue the party from a likely defeat would be more compelling. But that’s not the case.

The next question is whether it’s reasonable to expect Bloomberg to find a sizable number of Democratic primary voters who’d rally behind him. The New Yorker certainly has greater name recognition than the billionaire who’s already running for the Democratic nomination – hello, Tom Steyer – but it’s not unreasonable to be skeptical of Bloomberg’s chances.

Age is a consideration – Bloomberg is nine months older than Joe Biden, and only five months younger than Bernie Sanders – as is the fact that Bloomberg, in the not-too-distant past, was a Republican who helped elect George W. Bush to the White House. In New York City, he never even competed in a Democratic primary.

It’s also easy to imagine much of the Democratic base being suspicious of a billionaire jumping into the race, late in the game, using his resources to get ahead.

Finally, we recently kicked around the many problems “white knight” candidates face, which is why they nearly always fall short.

I know better than to make categorical predictions, and one look at the Oval Office serves as a reminder than unexpected things can and do happen in electoral politics. But given everything we know, the odds are not in Bloomberg’s – or any other possible 11th-hour candidates’ – favor."

And the former vice president dismissed suggestions that a likely candidacy by the billionaire business mogul and former New York City mayor is a reflection of his own performance as he runs for the White House.

Biden was in New Hampshire on Friday to file to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. His appearance came the morning after news that Bloomberg filed his paperwork on Friday – ahead of a deadline – to designate himself as a candidate in Alabama’s Democratic presidential primary.

BLOOMBERG MOVE UNDERSCORES DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONCERN OVER CURRENT 2020 FIELD

Bloomberg -- a former independent who registered last year as a Democrat -- flirted with a presidential bid early this year but in March ruled out a run. His top advisers said on Thursday that he changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls were not “well-positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

“I welcome him in the race. Michael's a solid guy and let's see where it goes. I have no problem with him getting in the race,” the former vice president told reporters.

Biden shot down talk that Bloomberg is likely to launch a Democratic nomination bid because Biden’s own campaign is struggling. Some recent polls have suggested the frontrunner is losing ground to rivals like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

“In terms of he's running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead,” he emphasized.

And Biden took a shot at reporters, saying, “I know you guys like this fiction about how things have closed down and everything's moving.”

Asked by Fox News if he’s talked with Bloomberg in recent days, the former vice president appeared to confirm the two have had a recent conversation, saying “I've spoken with Michael a lot.”

But he refused to elaborate, saying “it would be inappropriate of me to tell you about any conversations I had or didn't have with him about whether or not he was going to run.”

If Bloomberg launches a campaign, he could quickly spend millions on his own behalf. Biden – who’s long pushed for publicly funded elections and who’s struggled with his fundraising compared to some of his top 2020 rivals – didn’t directly answer when asked if he was concerned.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Instead, Biden praised Bloomberg’s contributions to the efforts to curb gun violence and to combat climate change.

Calling him an “honorable guy,” Biden said, “Michael Bloomberg has put a lot of money behind things that causes I care a lot about from dealing with keeping guns off the street and assault weapons, et cetera. He's done a lot for dealing with a whole range of issues.”

The conventional wisdom is Bloomberg – who like Biden is considered more moderate than others in the race - could take votes away from Biden. But longtime New Hampshire Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, a top Granite State Biden supporter, dismissed such concerns.

“Our guy is solid at this point in time,” the state senator stressed.

He said that Democrats in the state weren’t clamoring for another candidate to enter the race, noting they “are very satisfied with the current field of candidates.”

Biden -- accompanied by former four-term Democratic Gov. John Lynch -- passed through a cauldron of supporters packed into the halls of the historic New Hampshire Statehouse as he arrived to file. And after he filed, he headlined a rally with supporters.

While Biden remains at the fore in national polling, he’s slightly behind top-tier rivals Sanders of Vermont and Warren of Massachusetts in the latest New Hampshire survey. The two progressive standard-bearers hail from states seen as New Hampshire neighbors.

Biden emphasized that “it's really important that you do well in the first four states. It could be enough to make you a nominee. It could be enough to keep you in the race. It could be enough to take you out of the race.”

And he stressed that “I plan on trying to win New Hampshire. I'm not here to come in second. I never entered anything to come in second.”

A couple of hours before Biden’s appearance, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang filed to place his name on the primary ballot.

While complimenting Bloomberg, Yang predicted that “I do think that he’s going to have an uphill climb in the race, in part because of New Hampshire, where the people here in New Hampshire love to meet a candidate in person, take their temperature, look into their eyes, sometimes have them in their living room. I don’t think that’s going to be possible with Mike.”

And Yang – who’s campaigned extensively in the state over the past year and a half – emphasized that “there are some things money cannot buy and you can’t replace thousands of conversations in New Hampshire and in the early states with advertising. It’s just not possible. I welcome Mike into the race in the sense that he is a great American leader and has a lot to offer but I think he’s got his work cut out for him”

New Hampshire is the next major deadline Bloomberg faces. The deadline for candidates to file to place their name on the first-in-the nation presidential primary is next Friday, November 11.

Bloomberg aides told Fox News that there’s no word yet on whether the former New York City mayor will come to New Hampshire to file. But they added that they'll do ""everything necessary to keep all of our options open.”

But Bloomberg’s reached out to some top Granite State Democrats. Longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley told Fox News that he received a call from Bloomberg."
3,Brooke Singman,"EXCLUSIVE:House Republicans plan to call Hunter Biden, the Ukraine whistleblower and a range of other witnesses to testify in the upcoming public Trump impeachment hearings, according to a witness list obtained exclusively by Fox News.
It is unclear, at this… [+8684 chars]",House Republicans will call a number of high profile officials to testify in a public setting as part of the formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump.,2019-11-09,Fox News,"Republicans want Hunter Biden, Ukraine whistleblower as impeachment inquiry witnesses",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-hunter-biden-ukraine-whisteleblower-impeachment-witness,"EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans plan to call Hunter Biden, the Ukraine whistleblower and a range of other witnesses to testify in the upcoming public Trump impeachment hearings, according to a witness list obtained exclusively by Fox News.

It is unclear, at this point, how many of the Republicans’ proposed witnesses will be approved by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and the Democrats, because the newly-approved resolution governing the impeachment inquiry give the approval power to the chairman and the members of the majority.

""Americans see through this sham impeachment process, despite the Democrats' efforts to retroactively legitimize it last week,"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes wrote in a letter to Schiff on Saturday, referencing the impeachment rules.

""To provide transparency to your otherwise opaque and unfair process, and after consultation with [House Oversight Committee] Ranking Member Jim Jordan and [House Foreign Affairs Committee] Ranking Member Michael McCaul, the American people deserve to hear from the following witnesses in an open setting,"" he continued.

At the top of Republicans’ list is former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, who has emerged as a central figure in the Ukraine controversy due to his business dealings.

The impeachment inquiry began when a whistleblower reported that Trump had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine—specifically, why former Vice President Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter held a lucrative role on the board, bringing in a reported $50,000 per month.

Republicans noted that in testimony from former State Department official George Kent raised concerns about ""the appearance of a conflict of interest stemming from Mr. Biden's position on Burisma's board,"" and added that former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich was prepared by the Obama State Department to address questions about Mr. Biden's position on Burisma during her Senate confirmation process.

MULVANEY SEEKS TO JOIN LAWSUIT QUESTIONING HOUSE SUBPOENA POWER, SIDESTEPPING IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY

At the time, the former vice president was running U.S.-Ukraine policy under former President Barack Obama.

Republicans also plan to call the younger Biden's former long-time business partner, Devon Archer, who also sat on the board of Burisma. Republicans claim Archer can help the public to understand ""the nature and extent of Ukraine's pervasive corruption information that bears directly on President Trump's longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country.""

On Saturday, Schiff said in a statement that the Intelligence Committee was evaluating the GOP request and would ""give due consideration to witnesses within the scope of the impeachment inquiry, as voted on by the House.""

“This inquiry is not, and will not serve, however, as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit, or to facilitate the President’s effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm,” he said.

Fox News has also learned that Republicans plan to call the whistleblower—whose identity remains anonymous—to testify publicly as part of the inquiry. Schiff said in September the whistleblower would appear before Congress “very soon,” but in recent weeks has suggested that testimony is unnecessary.

""Because President Trump should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers, the anonymous whistleblower should testify,"" Nunes wrote. ""Moreover, given the multiple discrepancies between the whistleblower's complaint and the closed-door testimony of the witnesses, it is imperative that the American people hear definitively how the whistleblower developed his or her information, and who else the whistleblower may have fed the information he or she gathered and how that treatment of classified information may have led to the false narrative being perpetrated by the Democrats during this process.""

Republicans are also requesting that the ""more than half a dozen sources"" the whistleblower cited in their complaint to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, whose identities also remain anonymous, attend for a public deposition.

NIKKI HALEY SAYS TRUMP DOES NOT DESERVE 'DEATH PENALTY' IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS

In addition, Republicans also are expected to call Alexandra Chalupa as a witness. Chalupa was a Ukrainian-American consultant for the Democratic National Committee who allegedly had meetings with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C. to discuss incriminating information about Trump campaign officials during the 2016 presidential election.

Chalupa was first brought into the conversation in January 2017, after Politico published a report exposing her as a DNC operative, who worked in the Clinton White House and met with officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in an effort to expose ties between former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Russia.

""Given President Trump's documented belief that the Ukrainian government meddled in the 2016 election to oppose his candidacy, which forms the basis for a reasonable desire for Ukraine to investigate the circumstances surrounding the election and any potential Ukrainian involvement, Ms. Chalupa is a prime fact witness who can assist Congress and the American public in better understanding the facts and circumstances surrounding Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election,"" Nunes wrote.

JIM JORDAN ASSIGNED TO INTEL COMMITTEE AHEAD OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Also included in the list obtained by Fox News is Nellie Ohr—a researcher at opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned the now–infamous anti-Trump dossier, and was paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through law firm Perkins Coie. Ohr and her husband, DOJ official Bruce Ohr, were critical figures in Republicans’ efforts to investigate the origin of the Russia probe. Republicans are calling Nellie Ohr to testify because in October 2018, she told congressional investigators that Fusion GPS was getting information from Ukrainian sources.

""In a 2018 interview with the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, Ms. Ohr stated that, during her work with Fusion GPS that ultimately assisted in the production of the Steele Dossier—comprising false allegations against then-candidate Trump—Fusion GPS used information from sources in Ukraine, including Serhiy Leshchenko who recently lost his post from the Ukrainian parliament,"" Nunes wrote, noting that Ohr is a ""prime fact witness.""

Nunes, in his letter, said that he and Republicans ""expect that you will call each of the witnesses listed above to ensure that the Democrats’ “impeachment inquiry” treats the President with fairness, as promised by Speaker Pelosi.""

""Because the Democrats’ resolution unfairly restricts Minority rights and because you have provided no information about which witnesses you may invite to testify at future hearings not yet scheduled, we reserve our right to request additional witnesses, if necessary, as you announce additional hearings,"" he added. ""Your failure to fulfill Minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process.""

Meanwhile, Republicans will also call several officials that Democrats on the impeachment committees have already received testimony from—including ex-National Security Council official Tim Morrison, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, and high-ranking State Department official David Hale.

The House approved formal rules for the impeachment inquiry process last week. While Republicans opposed the resolution and complained the rules were unfair, they still gave minority Republicans the ability to subpoena witnesses, with the concurrence of Democratic committee chairs. If the chair does not consent, the minority can appeal to the full committee.

This process still gives Democrats final say over witnesses.

NUNES DEMANDS SCHIFF TESTIFY IN PRIVATE AS PART OF HOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Schiff, who is leading much of the impeachment inquiry, announced Wednesday that his committee would hold its first open hearings next week, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.

“Next week, the House Intelligence Committee will hold its first open hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry,” Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted Wednesday.

“On Wednesday, November 13, 2019, we will hear from William Taylor and George Kent,” Schiff continued. “On Friday, November 15, 2019, we will hear from Marie Yovanovitch.”

Meanwhile, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., penned a letter to Schiff late Friday, demanding the chairman appear for a deposition behind closed doors ahead of the public hearings next week to testify on his contacts with the whistleblower."

In an interview with PBS News Hour on Friday, Biden said that although he would not reverse President Trump's decision to move the embassy at this point, he said: ""I wouldn't have done it in the first place.""

A person close to Biden's campaign told Fox News on Thursday that Biden's comments are ""not out of synch with the position that he's had"" but rather are a criticism of the way Trump handled the decision, which drew the ire of Palestinians who also stake claim to the land.

BIDEN DROPS TO FOURTH AMONG IOWA DEMOCRATS, NEW POLL SHOWS

""His objection was not to the move but to the way it was done. It should have been made in the context of a larger deal that achieved important concessions for the peace process,"" the source told Fox News.

Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden said in a statement to Axios that ""Vice President Biden would not move the American embassy back to Tel Aviv, but he would re-open our consulate in East Jerusalem to engage the Palestinians.""

In 2018, Trump made good on a main campaign promise to appease his conservative and evangelical base by formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moving the embassy to the city.

Biden backed numerous pieces of legislation passed by the Senate during his tenure as a representative from Deleware that supported both moving the embassy and recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel-- a law that was waived by Trump's predecessors.

“Joe Biden spent literally decades promising to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, only to fail when he had eight years as vice president to do it. President Trump made a similar promise, but unlike Joe Biden, he actually stuck to his word and got it done,” Trump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement to Fox News on Thursday.

During former President Barack Obama's campaign in 2008, Biden said ""it's been my position for years,"" to have Jerusalem recognized as the undivided capital city of Israel.

""Jerusalem must be the capital of Israel. Whatever decision the Israelis make, that's a decision we'll support,” Biden said at the time.

“I think we should move the embassy, but you don't have a [Israeli] government asking us to move the embassy there. Let them make the judgment,” he added.

Biden's flip flop on the issue marks yet another attempt by the candidate to align himself with left-leaning voters by reversing his previously held stances, which has drawn the ire of other Democratic contenders vying for the nomination.

Biden, who has remained in the lead according to most national polls but is neck and neck with two other candidates-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.-- came under fire for changing his decades-long position on the Hyde Amendment in June.

His 2020 Democratic rivals criticized Biden's previous support as a senator for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to subsidize abortions except for cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is endangered -- a notion some of his campaign rivals fear has a disproportionate impact on minority communities.

Biden reversed his stance on the controversial piece of legislation at a campaign rally, saying he ""can no longer support an amendment that makes"" a woman's right to an abortion ""dependent on someone's ZIP code.""

Last week, the House approved rules for an already ongoing impeachment inquiry that stemmed from an anonymous intelligence community whistleblower’s complaint about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

A transcript of the call released by the Justice Department showed Trump urged Zelensky to probe Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who was reportedly making seven figures working for a Ukrainian natural gas company. The redacted memo also does not show any quid pro quo.

""When you look at the transcript, there's nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president,"" Haley said.

O'Donnell then interjected: ""To be clear, it was not a complete transcript. There are still things that are missing from it. And in it, he does say, 'I would like you to do us a favor,' though.""

Cotton said that Schiff, D-Calif., would not say that the whistleblower qualifies to be questioned by Republicans under his impeachment proceeding's rules.

The process still gives Democrats final say over witnesses, however, making it unlikely they can follow through on their plan to call Schiff to testify about his contact with the whistleblower.

WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY HAS LONG HISTORY OF TRYING TO BRING DOWN TRUMP; ADMITS CLIENT WORKED W/ DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

Cotton said that Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are going the ""extra mile"" to protect former Vice President Joe Biden from questions about his family's business dealings in Ukraine.

""I can't imagine that she wants to see Joe Biden or Hunter Biden called to account for this obvious conflict of interest during the Obama era,"" Cotton said.

“These questions basically say the Republicans can only have witnesses if they will play into his storyline. Nothing that would actually portray what truly happened. Certainly, nothing that would allow the calling of what may be the most important witnesses in this matter,” Cotton said.

Hanson claimed Friday on ""The Story"" that if Bloomberg seeks the same political lane as former Vice President Joe Biden, the Delaware Democrat appears to be a better fit for party centrists.

Biden, 76, can successfully play to his ""Good Old Joe From Scranton [Pa.]"" image and appeal to the white working-class, Hanson claimed.

The 77-year-old Bloomberg, on the other hand, has become well-known as a supporter of gun control and memorably campaigned against super-sized soft drinks while mayor of the Big Apple.

BLOOMBERG MOVE UNDERSCORES DEMOCRATIC PARTY PANIC OVER 2020 FIELD

""When you look at the issues that Bloomberg has advocated -- restrictions on the Second Amendment or 'nanny-state' intrusiveness into everything from plastic straws to super-sized drinks, climate change, open borders, sort of traditional engagement with China -- that's not the issues that won Donald Trump those swing states [in 2016],"" Hanson said.

""So, I don't quite see the logic.""

However, the Hoover Institution fellow also credited Bloomberg with being one of the richest men in the world, a ""master"" of media and well-informed on the issues.

""He was a Republican that won in New York -- which is an achievement, but other than that, he's got a lot of liabilities.""

Bloomberg won two mayoral elections in New York City as a Republican and won a third term as an independent before joining the Democratic ranks. He succeeded current Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, a Republican, as mayor and preceded incumbent Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.

In a recent statement, Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson said the ex-mayor is concerned about the current Democratic field and claimed his influx of resources into this week's Virginia state elections shows he is actively working to help the party. Wolfson noted Virginia's previously Republican-controlled House of Delegates and State Senate flipped to the blue column Tuesday.

""In 2018 [Bloomberg] spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable,"" Wolfson said. ""And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature.

On ""The Story,"" Hanson claimed Bloomberg lacks the charisma of other candidates -- which could hurt him in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and other key states Trump hopes to win.

She’s run a substantive campaign, and the press loves her gotta-plan-for-everything approach almost as much as her steady rise in the polls.

Joe Biden? The left can’t stand him. The Nation just ran an “anti-endorsement” urging Biden to drop out, saying he’d been “picking up where the Obama administration left off: a restoration of business as usual for the K Street lobbyists and Wall Street speculators.”

MEDIA TRUMPET KENTUCKY VOTE AS TRUMP FAVORITE FACES DEFEAT

But Warren would be the scourge of the big bankers, checks all the progressive boxes and isn’t a white male to boot. No wonder Bill Gates is openly worrying that she’ll soak him for $100 billion.

Sure, the Massachusetts senator is starting to get a tad more scrutiny since she unveiled a $20-trillion plan to pay for Medicare for All, after months of finessing journalists’ questions on the issue. And there was an “SNL” skit with Kate McKinnon portraying her as a know-it-all playing with funny money—not exactly Alec Baldwin territory.

But these have been dwarfed by glowing profiles of her time in Oklahoma, or at Harvard, or even as a bankruptcy lawyer, and how she developed into a fierce consumer advocate.

So why is a founding editor of Politico suggesting the press is giving her short shrift?

The argument John Harris makes in his new column is that reporters talk to downbeat Democrats who are chattering about Warren and “her embrace of mandatory ‘Medicare for All.’ By these lights: The plan is wildly expensive, unrealistic, frightening to moderate voters in key swing states who want to dump Trump but need reassurance before empowering a liberal in the Oval Office.”

After all, how much of an albatross would it be in a fall campaign when more voters learn that Warren would kick 150 million Americans off private insurance in favor of a massive government-run program?

Harris, a former Washington Post reporter, concludes that “the more pervasive force shaping coverage of Washington and elections is what might be thought of as centrist bias, flowing from reporters and sources alike. It is a headwind for Warren, Sanders, the ‘squad’ on Capitol Hill, even for Trump. This bias is marked by an instinctual suspicion of anything suggesting ideological zealotry, an admiration for difference-splitting, a conviction that politics should be a tidier and more rational process than it usually is.”

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

Harris admits to this bias, and then challenges himself to provide the other side.

Warren, he writes, “is ready to divide the county and her party over the proposition that a much more aggressive role for government is needed to bring business to heel and protect individuals and the global climate from the predations of a free market…Fundamental societal change comes from people burning with grievances, obsessed with remedies, ready to demolish old power arrangements to achieve their ends.”

In other words, it’s risky and aggressive candidates who wind up changing society, such as Trump in 2016, not the wise and seasoned incrementalists. In fact, it’s the media establishment and Beltway mandarins that have brought us such debacles as the Iraq war and 2008 financial meltdown.

Well, maybe. But first you’ve gotta get elected. And Democrats have to decide whether Warren represents their best shot.

Meanwhile, the Washington Post takes some relatively mild criticism of Warren from Biden and Pete Buttigieg to ask whether they are getting into “one of the most fraught areas for a female candidate: Is she likable?”

Buttigieg criticized Warren’s “my way or the highway approach” and said she is “so absorbed in the fighting that it is as though fighting were the purpose.” Biden said she reflects “an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics.”

These are garden-variety jabs in politics. They’re not saying she’s personally angry. They’re saying she’s a rigid ideologue who doesn’t like compromise—just what you’d expect from rivals occupying the moderate lane.

If even policy-based criticism of Elizabeth Warren is ruled suspect, she’ll sail to the nomination, despite the misgivings of the media and political establishment."

Schoen's comments came as President Trump predicted on Friday that Bloomberg wouldn't ""do well"" and would hurt former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ""Little Michael will fail,"" Trump said outside of the White House.

While Bloomberg has filed to run as a candidate in Alabama's Democratic primary, he has yet to make an official announcement.

""If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing. But the late timing of our entry means that many candidates already have a big head start in the four early states, where they've spent months and months campaigning and spending money,” Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson said in a statement.

BIDEN ON BLOOMBERG: 'I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH HIM GETTING IN THE RACE'

“We have enormous respect for the Democratic primary process and many friends in those states, but our plan is to run a broad-based, national campaign,” he added.

Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina are the first four states to kick off the presidential nominating calendar. They are scheduled to hold their caucuses and primaries in February of next year, ahead of the rest of the country.

Top-tier candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Vice President Joe Biden, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have built up strong organizations – with plenty of boots on the ground - in the early voting states.

Bloomberg flirted with a presidential bid early this year – including a swing through New Hampshire - but in March ruled out a 2020 White House run. His top advisers said on Thursday that he changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls were not “well positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

On Friday, Bloomberg aides filed paperwork in Alabama to designate him as a candidate in that state’s Democratic presidential primary just ahead of the deadline.

Bloomberg aides told Fox News the next primary ballot deadline he faces as he takes concrete steps towards launching a White House bid is Tuesday in Arkansas

Minutes after Bloomberg’s announcement, New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley responded.

“We are disappointed and frankly very surprised that any candidate would launch a campaign for the White House where their path doesn't run through New Hampshire or any of the other early states,” Buckley wrote.

“New Hampshire and other early state voters are some of the most engaged voters in the country,"" the longtime state party chair added. ""They ask tough questions that prepare the candidates for what's to come in the general election. It's unfortunate that Michael Bloomberg doesn't want to participate in this invaluable, important, and unique primary process and be tested the same way that the other Democratic candidates have been and will be.""

And Iowa Democratic Party chair Troy Price tweeted that ""it's disappointing to hear that Mayor Bloomberg doesn’t plan on competing in Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses or the other three early nominating states.""

Retail campaigning is a crucial compenent of campaign politics in Iowa and New Hampshire, with some voters in both states often meeting and asking qusetions of the candidates multiple times during the course of a presidential primary cycle.

If Bloomberg follows through and officially enters the race, he's expected to spend millions of his own money on his White House bid, lauching TV and digital ads from coast to coast as he likely runs a national campaign.

But Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang, who's campaigned extensively in Iowa and New Hampshire over the past year and a half, predicted that Bloomberg is ""going to have a uphill climb in the race.""

Speaking to reporters after he filed to place his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot - hours before Bloomberg's announced decision to skip the early voting states - Yang said “there are somethings money cannot buy and you can’t replace thousands of conversations in New Hampshire and in the early states with advertising. It’s just not possible.""

""I welcome Mike into the race in the sense that he is a great American leader and has a lot to offer but I think he’s got his work cut out for him,"" Yang added."

Jordan, R-Ohio, replaces Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., who temporarily resigned from his post on the panel Friday.

TRUMP CLAIMS IMPEACHMENT MAKING HIM 'STRONGER,' RAILS AGAINST WHISTLEBLOWER

“Jim Jordan has been on the front lines in the fight for fairness and truth. His addition will ensure more accountability and transparency in this sham process,"" House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a statement on Friday.

Under current terms, Jordan, as the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, has been in the room for most closed-door depositions. Because he is not a member of the Intelligence Committee, though, the Ohio Republican cannot ask questions.

""In Speaker Pelosi’s House, those responsibilities have fallen victim to partisan witch hunts,"" McCarthy said. ""The typically venerable Intelligence Committee has now become the partisan Impeachment Committee.""

McCarthy said Crawford will rejoin the committee after the inquiry is complete.

""Along with millions of Americans across the country who are frustrated with this impeachment-obsessed majority, Rick has offered to step aside for this charade,"" McCarthy said. ""When it is finished, Rick will rejoin the committee and resume his work to keep our country safe.""

A senior House Democratic aid tells Fox News that Democrats allowed the personnel shift because “it is customary that whoever the minority proposes is accepted.”

Jordan, who has been a staunch defender of the president, in his current role, would not have been on the dais during open hearings next week to counterpunch. Republican leadership all week had been weighing the Jordan move, and considering adding Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., as well. But in order to position Jordan on the panel, Republican leadership is required to remove one of the current Republicans on the panel. Removing three, to also include Meadows and Zeldin, would be somewhat of a feat.

""Politically, there's no way for us to pull this off,"" a Republican source told Fox News.

The assignment comes just days before the first open hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., announced that the first public hearings as part of the inquiry would be held next Wednesday and Friday, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.

“Next week, the House Intelligence Committee will hold its first open hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry,” Schiff tweeted.

“On Wednesday, November 13, 2019, we will hear from William Taylor and George Kent,” he continued. “On Friday, November 15, 2019, we will hear from Marie Yovanovitch.”

“More to come,” he added.

The first public hearing will feature Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who already testified behind closed doors before congressional investigators that the president pushed Ukraine to investigate election interference, former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and their Ukrainian dealings — and that he was told U.S. military aid and a White House meeting were used as leverage to get a public announcement from Kiev that the probes were underway.

TRUMP-UKRAINE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY TO START 'OPEN HEARINGS' NOV. 13, SCHIFF SAYS

Kent, the deputy assistant Secretary of State, also will appear with Taylor. Kent testified behind closed doors last month, and told the committees that he had concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, in 2015, but was rebuffed by the former vice president’s staff, which said the office was preoccupied with Beau Biden’s cancer battle.

Meanwhile, next Friday, Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, will appear in a public setting. She testified last month behind closed doors as well, telling lawmakers that Ukraine told her about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s campaign to oust her from her post in the administration. Yovanovitch was pushed out of her job in May on Trump’s orders.

Yovanovitch said she learned from Ukrainian officials last November or December that Giuliani was in touch with Ukraine’s former top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, “and that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me.”

“Basically, it was people in the Ukrainian government who said that Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general, was in communication with Mayor Giuliani,” she testified.

In her testimony, Yovanovitch also told investigators that she was not disloyal to the president.

""I have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told our embassy team to ignore the president's orders since he was going to be impeached,"" she said. ""That allegation is false. I have never said such a thing to my embassy colleagues or anyone eIse.""

""We move forward with the open phase,"" Schiff told reporters on the Hill on Wednesday, adding that the committee still has ""remaining depositions,"" which they ""will be conducting over the next couple of days.""

The impeachment inquiry was opened after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.

A transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any quid pro quo. Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.

The White House, though, has maintained the president did nothing wrong.

The House of Representatives, last week, passed a measure largely along party lines, formalizing the process and setting “ground rules” for the impeachment inquiry, including for public witness testimony.

While Republicans opposed the resolution and complained the rules were unfair, they still gave minority Republicans the ability to subpoena witnesses, with the concurrence of Democratic committee chairs. If the chair does not consent, the minority can appeal to the full committee.

""We're glad to see that Chairman Schiff has decided to move his impeachment proceedings out of his top-secret bunker and into the public eye,"" a GOP aide told Fox News Wednesday. ""We're confident that the American people will see that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on the Ukrainian government -- for anything.""

The GOP aide added: ""Unlike Chairman Schiff, we have never had anything to hide and look forward to the opportunity to present the facts of the case.""

Meanwhile, U.S. diplomat David Hale appeared before the committees leading the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday behind closed doors. Hale is expected to tell lawmakers that political considerations were behind the State Department's decision to withhold U.S. military aid from Ukraine.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are locked in a race to the left that could leave either struggling to attract the center in a general election, and former Vice President Joe Biden is facing lingering doubts about his campaign's strength.

The billionaire Bloomberg, despite previously ruling out a run, is expected to file paperwork this week designating himself as a candidate in Alabama’s Democratic presidential primary. In a statement, his political adviser Howard Wolfson said bluntly that Bloomberg was worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls is not “well positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

BLOOMBERG EXPECTED TO FILE PAPERWORK TO ENTER 2020 ALABAMA DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

""In 2018 [Bloomberg] spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable,"" Wolfson said. ""And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature.""

He added: ""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated -- but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.""

That’s a view shared by a number of Democratic strategists and commentators. While Biden remains near the top of the polls, questions about his age, fitness and fundraising ability have shadowed him, and he has been savaged by the party’s left-flank for his more moderate positions on questions such as health care, immigration and even working with Republicans.

“This is a thunderclap,” Obama strategist David Axelrod tweeted about the Bloomberg news. “And not exactly a vote of confidence from leading moderate in durability of @JoeBiden campaign.”

Trump, meanwhile, predicted that Bloomberg would hurt Biden, and indicated he looked forward to the prospect of a Bloomberg candidacy.

“There’s no one I would rather run against than Little Michael,” Trump told reporters, while also casting doubt on Bloomberg's ability to prevail in the primaries.

It remains unclear whether Bloomberg, running from the center-left, could command the kind of primary support necessary to rise in the packed field, even spending his own fortune to do it.

One possibility, as Trump suggested, is that he'd draw just enough support from Biden to boost a more liberal candidate such as Warren, D-Mass., or Sanders. I-Vt. -- whose big-spending policy prescriptions have also raised alarm about general election viability.

“There’s more anxiety than ever,” Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, told The New York Times last month. Brown has also been eyed by some Democrats as a possible late entrant to the race.

“We’re both getting the calls. I’ve been surprised by some who’ve called me,” Schultz said.

Last Friday, Warren released her “Medicare-for-all” plan, coming with an eyewatering price tag of $52 trillion (including $20 trillion in new spending over the next decade) and a promise not to raise taxes on the middle class -- a claim met with deep skepticism from across the political spectrum. But centrists were also scathing about how the plan would play out in swing states.

“This is going to cause down-ballot damage in swing districts and states if she’s the nominee,” Colorado State Rep. Bri Buentello told Politico.

Sanders, meanwhile, on Thursday released his immigration plan -- a grab bag of far-left items including a deportation freeze, full welfare access for illegal immigrants, the dismantling of federal immigration agencies, and the promise to accept a minimum of 50,000 “climate migrants” in the first year of a Sanders administration.

While those plans have been cheered by left-wing activists, it is far from clear how well they would go down in swing states any Democrat needs to win in order to beat Trump.

While current national polling suggests most of the main 2020 candidates would beat Trump next year, there are warning signs in the polling data for Democrats -- apart from the general caveat that most polling also showed Trump losing in 2016, and he didn’t.

The swing states generally show a tighter race against Trump. A New York Times/Siena College survey in six battleground states released Friday shows that Democrats there also prefer a more moderate pick. A majority, 55 percent, said they wanted a candidate more moderate than most Democrats, and 62 percent wanted a candidate who would try and find common ground with Republicans.

“With Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on may be pulling up lame and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,” Axelrod told the Times last month.

The idea that Bloomberg’s entrance into the 2020 race is a response to the deficiencies of the current field has been greeted by glee by Republicans.

“Really? Another one?"" Republican National Committee Rapid Response Director Steve Guest tweeted. “The fact that Michael Bloomberg feels the need to run for president underscores the weak Democrat field and shows that Democrats know they can’t compete with @realDonaldTrump in 2020.”

There are other signs that Democrats on the sidelines are nervous about the current field. Hillary Clinton has been the subject of a series of rumors that she may throw her hat in the race -- a prospect that seemed unthinkable a year ago. The Washington Post, meanwhile, reported that former Attorney General Eric Holder is considering stepping into the race too.

The consideration of any of these politicians may reflect sheer personal ambition as much as concern about the field -- but the fact they're even flirting with a run at this late stage indicates they see an opening for that reason.

It remains to be seen whether Bloomberg will jump all the way in. The next major deadline he faces is in New Hampshire, where the deadline for candidates to put their name on the ballot is Nov. 11. Bloomberg aides tell Fox News there’s no word yet on whether the former New York City mayor will come to New Hampshire to file. But they add that they'll do ""everything necessary to keep all of our options open.”

Team Bloomberg is also reaching out to top Granite State Democrats. Longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley told Fox News that he’s been contacted. But others have pushed back on the idea that what Democratic voters want is even more candidates to choose from.

Longtime New Hampshire based Democratic consultant James Demers – who’s backing Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey this cycle – said that “anybody and everybody has a right to run if they want to but I’m hearing voters more and more saying ‘I really want this field to winnow down to six or seven so I can process who’s running and they’re not asking for the field to grow.’

“So I think it’s a high-stakes game for anyone to get in this late in the game because that’s not where the voters’ heads are,” he said.

Mulvaney was called to testify on Friday at 9 a.m., but did not show up.

HOUSE COMMITTEES REQUEST MICK MULVANEY DEPOSITION AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., subpoenaed Mulvaney after the White House rejected the original request for him to appear. Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Oversight Committee Acting Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., had wanted to hear from the top White House official, claiming he had “substantial first-hand knowledge and information” relevant to the inquiry.

""Past Democrat and Republican administrations would not be inclined to permit senior advisers to the president to participate in such a ridiculous, partisan, illegitimate proceeding – and neither is this one,” White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters on Tuesday.

Mulvaney has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry, which was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint about the now-infamous July 25 phone call between the president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower alleged that Trump, during the call, pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden—as military aid to the country was being withheld.

Schiff, Engel and Maloney have claimed that evidence uncovered in the inquiry, thus far, has revealed that Mulvaney was “directly involved in an effort orchestrated by President Trump, his personal agent Rudolph Giuliani, and others to withhold a coveted White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations that would benefit President Trump’s personal political interests, and jeopardized our national security in attempting to do so.”

A transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any ""quid pro quo."" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.

The chairs also accused Mulvaney of playing “a central role” in the president’s move to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and criticized him for his response to questions about the funds during a press conference at the White House last month.

The chairs wrote: “You admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine security assistance to further the President’s own personal, political interests, rather than national interest.""

During a press conference on Oct. 17, Mulvaney was asked why Trump ordered the hold on military aid. The White House’s position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.

“We do that all the time with foreign policy,” Mulvaney said. “And I have news for everybody: Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.”

For days afterward, Mulvaney tried to walk back his statement after critics claimed he acknowledged a ""quid pro quo,"" but the committee chairs described his earlier comment as a confession.

MULVANEY SUBPOENAED AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

“Despite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trump’s order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the President’s 2020 re-election campaign,” they wrote.

The House has deposed a slew of witnesses, several of whom have indicated that Mulvaney -- who is also the director of the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) -- withheld military assistance to Ukraine on Trump's orders, a charge strongly denied by the White House.

The latest official to do so was Bill Taylor, the acting Ambassador to Ukraine. Schiff released Taylor’s testimony on Wednesday, showing he told lawmakers that “the hold on security assistance for Ukraine came from Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and that the Chief of Staff maintained a skeptical view of Ukraine.”

Taylor also testified that Mulvaney “helped schedule the call” on July 25 between Trump and Zelensky, despite opposition from ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton, who warned the call would be “a disaster.”

Taylor said that Bolton “thought that there could be some talk of investigations or worse on the call.”

“Turned out he was right,” Taylor said."

Sens. Harris, D-Calif., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to Barr after The Washington Post reported that Trump made the request around Sept. 25, when the administration released a transcript of the call.

TRUMP PUSHES BACK ON REPORT BARR DENIED REQUEST FOR PRESS CONFERENCE CLEARING HIM ON UKRAINE

The outlet reported that Trump has told associates he wished Barr would have held the news conference, amid the escalating House impeachment probe surrounding the call. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Trump's desire for a public announcement from Barr was discussed among White House officials, who in turn relayed that desire to the Justice Department. However, the outlet reported that it couldn't be determined how hard Trump had pressed for a news conference -- or the reason for Barr's denial.

“These reports raise serious concerns about the president’s perception of the Justice Department as a partisan political instrument and his willingness to use the power of federal law enforcement in pursuit of his own objectives,” the senators wrote in the request.

“We submit this FOIA request in order to obtain communications, documents, and other information related to the president’s reported request that you hold a news conference to clear him of wrongdoing during his call with the Ukrainian president,” the request said.

House Democrats claim that the call, in which Trump urged Zelensky to “look into” allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and alleged Ukraine interference in the 2016 presidential election, was part of a quid pro quo involving the withholding of U.S. military aid that was temporarily blocked by the White House. Trump has denied a quid quo pro while the Ukrainians have said there was no pressure from the White House.

Trump has also pushed back on the reports.

“Bill Barr did not decline my request to talk about Ukraine,” he tweeted Thursday morning. “The story was a Fake Washington Post con job with an 'anonymous' source that doesn’t exist. Just read the Transcript. The Justice Department already ruled that the call was good. We don’t have freedom of the press!”

Trump then tweeted a more robust denial: ""The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference. Never happened, and there were no sources!"" This, after he tweeted earlier calling the story “totally untrue and just another FAKE NEWS story with anonymous sources that don’t exist.”

The request from the senators calls for all memos and correspondence involving Barr, Deputy Attorney General Jeffery Rosen or the immediate office of the attorney general since August 14 as well as phrases including “Ukraine,” “Zelensky,” “transcript,” “journalists” and “news conference.”

“If President Trump’s passionate assertion that such reports are ‘pure fiction’ and ‘Fake News’ is indeed correct, then the Department of Justice should have no problem in expeditiously processing our request,” the senators wrote.

Charles Cooper said in the letter that his client “was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far."" However, the letter suggested that Bolton will only appear before Congress if a judge orders him to do so.

BOLTON WARNED OF 'HAND GRENADE' GIULIANI, SHUT DOWN UKRAINE MEETING, AIDE TOLD IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The heads of the three House committees leading the investigation-- House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel, D-N.Y.-- had previously requested that Bolton testify but he did not appear for a scheduled Thursday interview.

Cooper said Bolton and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman are seeking a ""definitive judgment from the Judicial Branch determining their Constitutional duty in the face of conflicting demands"" from the White House and Congress. The attorney -- who represents both men -- noted that unlike the other witnesses, Bolton and Kupperman provided direct advice to Trump regularly and would be asked during any congressional appearance to disclose sensitive foreign policy and national security information.

House Democrats leading the probe into whether Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in exchange for military aid have accused Bolton and Kupperman of stonewalling after Bolton failed to show up for a deposition this past week.

Investigators slapped Kupperman with a subpoena for relevant information related to the probe but later withdrew it and said they would not seek one for Bolton. Instead, they mused that they'd use both of their refusals to cooperate as further evidence that the president is trying to obstruct Congress in their inquiry, forming the basis for one of the articles of impeachment against Trump.

MICK MULVANEY SUBPOENAED BY HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The House committees have also accused Bolton and Kupperman of coordinating with the White House to skirt Congressional subpoenas and delay the inquiry even further, which the two have vehemently denied.

""Dr. Kupperman stands ready, as does Ambassador Bolton, to testify if the Judiciary resolves the conflict in favor of the Legislative Branch's position respecting such testimony,"" Cooper wrote. ""The House Chairs are mistaken to say Dr. Kupperman's lawsuit is intended ""to delay or otherwise obstruct the Committees' vital investigatory work.""

Several witnesses who have testified have indicated that Bolton was gravely concerned by what they viewed as attempts by the president to engage in a quid pro quo arrangement with Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens.

Most recently, Fiona Hill, a former top White House expert on Russia, testified that Bolton distanced himself from the effort to leverage investigations from Ukrainians in exchange for a White House meeting -- and warned that Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani was a “hand grenade” who was “going to blow up everyone,” according to transcripts of her testimony released on Friday.

Hill told Congress that Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney met with Ukrainian officials in the White House on July 10 and told them that the White House would agree to a meeting between Zelensky and Trump if the investigations into Biden began. Hill said that Bolton ""immediately stiffened and ended the meeting.""

Hill said Bolton ""made it clear that he believed that they were making, basically, an improper arrangement to have a meeting in the White House, that they were predicating the meeting in the White House on the Ukrainians agreeing, in this case, based on the meeting on July 10th, to restart investigations that had been dropped in the energy sector.""

Hill added that Bolton later told her: ""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up"" and asked her to relay that message to a White House lawyer.

Exclusive: Key witness in Trump impeachment inquiry communicated with Dem staffer on 'delicate' issue after complaint, emails show, despite testimony

Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and a key witness in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, communicated through her personal email account with a Democratic congressional staffer about a ""quite delicate"" and ""time-sensitive"" matter -- just two days after the whistleblower complaint that kickstarted the inquiry was filed, and a month before the complaint became public, emails obtained Thursday by Fox News showed.

During Yovanovitch's deposition on Capitol Hill last month, U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., asked her about an email she received Aug. 14 from the staffer, Laura Carey -- and Yovanovitch indicated under oath that she had never personally responded to it. She said only that someone in the ""Legislative Affairs Office"" at the State Department had responded to Carey, to the best of her knowledge.

However, emails obtained by Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" showed that in fact, Yovanovitch had responded to Carey's initial Aug. 14 email, writing that she ""would love to reconnect and look forward to chatting with you.""

State Department official flagged Hunter Biden's 'conflict of interest' in Ukraine, testimony shows

A career official at the State Department told House investigators conducting the impeachment inquiry against President Trump that he raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest with Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine while his father Joe Biden oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president -- but was told that it wasn't appropriate to discuss the matter because of the health struggles of Biden's eldest son, Beau.

According to a transcript of his Oct. 15 closed-door deposition released Thursday, George Kent said that in January or February 2015, he ""became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board"" of Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings. After discussing concerns about the perception of a conflict of interest with Joe Biden's staff, Kent said he was shut down. ""The message that I recall hearing back was that the Vice President's son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time,"" he testified.

In his testimony, Kent also confirmed he had no ""direct knowledge"" that U.S. aid to Ukraine was ever connected to the opening of a new investigation against the Bidens concerning their business dealings there.

Bloomberg appears ready to enter 2020 race - and Dem aide thinks it's 'just what the doctor ordered'

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg appears to be seriously considering entering the 2020 race for president. Bloomberg is expected to file paperwork this week designating himself as a candidate in Alabama's March 3 Democratic presidential primary, Fox News has learned. He had announced earlier this year that he would not seek the party's nomination. But in a statement obtained Thursday by Fox News, Bloomberg political adviser Howard Wolfson said the billionaire businessman was worried the current crop of Democrats seeking the White House was ""not well-positioned"" to defeat President Trump.

In an appearance on ""The Ingraham Angle"" Thursday, Chris Hahn, a former aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Bloomberg ""might be just what the doctor ordered to shake this thing up right now"" and would shift the current 2020 Democratic presidential field's focus to issues important to the center of the party and people across the country.

CBS News sparks outrage for reportedly firing ex-ABC News staffer who leaked Epstein bombshell

CBS News is facing heavy backlash for reportedly firing the ex-ABC News staffer who leaked footage of ABC News anchor Amy Robach exposing how the network killed the Jeffrey Epstein story. Journalist Yashar Ali cited ""two sources with knowledge of the situation"" who claimed ABC News executives ""believe they know the identity"" of a former employee with access to the viral footage, in which Robach claims her network ""quashed"" her reporting on Epstein, and that they suspected the leaker was working at CBS News.

According to Ali, executives at both networks were in contact throughout the process and the CBS staffer has since been fired. The reported collaboration between the two networks and firing of the CBS staffer were widely criticized on social media. ""CBS fired a staffer for... a story that was embarrassing to ABC?""

HIPSTERS, HENRY, HOGS AND HOW TO LOSE AN ELECTION

As the weather turns nippy here in our nation’s capital we cannot resist thinking of Bob Hope’s great old line: “It’s so cold in Washington that the politicians actually have their hands in their own pockets.” In order to keep the blood pumping, what do you say to a serving of news nuggets?



- Oh, Michael Bloomberg. The former New York mayor and multi-billionaire is a national political figure in the same way that Brooklyn hipsters are leading a national cultural trend. It seems true if you live in the media universe of the NYT, “Morning Joe” and Vanity Fair think pieces. In what is at least his third flirtation with a presidential run in this cycle alone, Bloomberg is using his wealth to start to secure ballot access for next year’s primaries… Just in case. This was met with huge response across the media spectrum. But our default position remains, “So what?” We’d imagine that Bloomberg would open up in something like sixth place if he did declare. And as Tom Steyer has shown a willingness to burn bales of money hardly guarantees forward momentum. The consultants who have bought second homes stoking Bloomberg’s presidential fantasies are likely the only ones to benefit from this, ahem, bloomlet.



- But what if he really does jump in? If Bloomberg gets any kind of traction the obvious beneficiary is Elizabeth Warren. The bellyaching from old-guard Democrats like David Axelrod about front-runner Joe Biden has helped draw Bloomberg closer to the race. But what do these mandarins think would happen if Bloomberg really got in? He wouldn’t be drawing votes from Warren, that’s for sure. His only path forward would be to cut Biden off at the knees, further splitting the moderate vote. There are no perfect candidates, that’s a fact the Democratic donor class had better figure out if they’re really serious about winning in 2020.



- One of the strategies Republicans are reportedly weighing to deflect criticism of President Trump’s Ukrainian fiasco is to scapegoat three Trump insiders: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Rudy Giuliani and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. The idea would be to say that three had gone rogue and exceeded the president’s desires. Mulvaney, as it turned out, was quite right in the Oct. 17 press conference that was denounced and derided. His stated position – that Trump had leaned on his Ukrainian counterpart about Joe Biden, that aid to the country was conditioned on cooperation, that politics are part of foreign policy and that everybody needed to “get over it” – has become the de facto position of the GOP and administration. It makes sense to torch Giuliani, who has only been bad news for Trump. Sondland is already acting as a free agent. But it seems more than a little dangerous to try to punish the chief of staff just now.



- As Michael Kinsley long ago taught us about Washington: “The scandal isn't what's illegal, the scandal is what's legal.” A great piece in the WSJ today from reporters Thomas Grove and Alan Cullison illustrates one of the slimiest realities of life in Washington. There’s been a great deal of focus on how Hunter Biden cashed in on his father’s influence with wealthy foreigners seeking favorable treatment from the U.S. government. But like many others, Burisma, the Ukrainian firm at the center of the scandal, pumped big money into official Washington through multiple channels. The slop bucket sloshes on think tanks, lobbyists, message mavens and other influence peddlers. It’s all perfectly legal and perfectly putrid. But from Beijing to Riyadh to Moscow to Mexico City, rich and powerful folks know that the hogs will line up at the trough in Washington every time. Oink, oink.



- We were dubious about the near-universal predictions that Jeff Sessions’ effort to reclaim his Alabama Senate seat would run into a buzz saw of opposition from his erstwhile tormenter, President Trump. Sessions’ rivals were quick to blast him for alleged disloyalty to Trump and most coverage focused on how Trump would play in the primary. But given his first opportunity to lace into Sessions in today’s installment of “Chopper Talk” Trump gave Sessions a pass and even praised his former attorney general for – what else – saying nice things about him. It makes perfect sense to us. Sessions endured all the slings and arrows of Trumps abuse without complaint and had only praise for his former boss in his campaign announcement. If Trump gets in the Alabama political swamp he might lose again, as he did backing Luther Strange in 2017, or help disgraced former Judge Roy Moore win the nomination again in a divided field.



- The American Enterprise Institute’s Matthew Continetti is always a must-read for us. Few political writers, left, right or center, can match his combination of gifts of language and perception while maintaining the requisite honest self-appraisal to avoid dogmatism. His analysis of this week’s Virginia election results is perfect proof: “As Virginia has moved into the Democratic column, the state Republican Party has become more populist, more nationalist, and more culturally conservative. The dwindling number of Republicans who spoke the language of suburbia could not escape their party's national reputation for hostility to immigrants and opposition to progressive ideals. A similar process occurred in states like California, Colorado, and Nevada. It may also be underway in Arizona and Texas (!).”



- How about a little shameless self-promotion? You can hear Chris on the most recent installment of Jonah Goldberg’s Remnant podcast. It’s got it all: Cutting edge analysis, cured meat, “Caddyshack” and the dangers of political determinism. Listen here.



- Writing at the NYT Timothy Egan explores the dangers of “insufferable wokeness” for Democrats looking to win converts ahead of the 2020 election. “It’s no mystery why so many Democrats can no longer connect to the white working class. Progressives promise free college, free health care, free child care, and scream in bafflement, What’s wrong with you people? No doubt, some of those people are racist and xenophobic. But many others simply feel insulted and dismissed.” Democrats interested in forging a winning coalition ought to read Egan right after they finish watching Aziz Ansari’s latest comedy special “Right Now.” And if they don’t have time for that, just try the one-minute clip of former President Barack Obama who reminded listeners: “This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically ‘woke’ and all that stuff. You should get over that quickly.” More addition, less division, please.



- Speaking of good things to watch, we loved director David Michôd’s interpretation of William Shakespeare’s “Henry V.” The film, called “The King,” distributed by Netflix and starring Timothée Chalamet, is wonderful in many ways, not the least of which is in rescuing the character John Falstaff from the clammy clutches of venal buffoonery in which so many directors have placed him. But the obvious great omission is one of Shakespeare’s finest speeches: The St. Crispin’s Day speech from Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. There is perhaps no finer, fuller expression of patriotism and the duty of men at arms than the speech. But we know that Chalamet’s take on Hal wouldn’t allow for such heroic orations. And who would want to follow Kenneth Branagh’s unsurpassable performance? So by all means watch “The King,” but maybe also take three minutes to watch Branagh raise the banner – “we few, we happy few, we band of brothers” – to get in the right spirit this Veteran’s Day weekend.



THE RULEBOOK: RULES ARE RULES

“When men, engaged in unjustifiable pursuits, are aware that obstructions may come from a quarter which they cannot control, they will often be restrained by the bare apprehension of opposition, from doing what they would with eagerness rush into, if no such external impediments were to be feared.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 73



TIME OUT: ALLES KLAR, HERR KOMMISSAR?

WSJ: “On the evening of Nov. 9, 1989, an unremarkable East German functionary named Günter Schabowski bungled an assignment – and accidentally helped bring down the Berlin Wall. … At a press conference that was broadcast live … [Schabowski] broached the topic only in the final minutes, after a stultifying, hourlong description of the East German regime’s internal debates. … Then a reporter asked about travel possibilities for East Germans. Schabowski initially answered in soporific fashion, with frequent pauses and ‘uhs.’ But then he mumbled that the party had decided ‘to issue a regulation that will make it possible for every citizen…to emigrate.’ A reporter shouted, ‘When does that go into force?’ The interruption visibly irritated Schabowski, who fumbled with his briefing papers to search for the answer. His aide finally pointed out the relevant page, and Schabowski read the text aloud so rapidly as to be almost incomprehensible… Someone shouted again, ‘When does that go into force?’ Schabowski scanned the unfamiliar text again and picked out some of its words: ‘Immediately…without delay.’ … Caught unprepared, the secret police, border guards and military forces scrambled to reassert their power, but it was too little, too late.”

POLL: BATTLEGROUND DEMS WANT MODERATE NOMINEE

NYT: “Democrats in the country’s most pivotal general election battlegrounds prefer a moderate presidential nominee who would seek common ground with Republicans rather than pursue an ambitious, progressive agenda, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of primary voters across six states. As the Democratic candidates intensify their argument over how best to defeat President Trump, their core voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida are counseling them to pursue a political middle ground. A majority of those surveyed said they wanted a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats, and they overwhelmingly preferred one who would bridge the partisan divide in Washington. The party’s voters are more evenly split on the scale of change they are seeking from their nominee: 49 percent said they preferred a candidate who would return politics in Washington to normal, while 45 percent hope for one who will bring fundamental change to American society.”



Report: Steyer aide offered money for endorsements in Iowa - AP: “A top aide to Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer in Iowa privately offered campaign contributions to local politicians in exchange for endorsing his White House bid, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the conversations. The overtures from Pat Murphy, a former state House speaker who is serving as a top adviser on Steyer’s Iowa campaign, aren’t illegal — though payments for endorsements would violate campaign finance laws if not disclosed. There’s no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Steyer’s campaign as compensation for their backing. But the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House. Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Steyer’s campaign would think he could purchase their support.”



DEMS DISCUSS OPTIONS FOR ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT

ABC News: “House Democrats have considered drafting as many as three articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, as they prepare to take their Ukraine impeachment inquiry public next week… No decisions have been made, and what happens will ultimately be shaped by the conclusions and findings of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. … Democrats have floated the possibility of charging Trump with abuse of power for efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s family and the 2016 election, as well as obstruction of Congress for the administration’s refusal to comply with subpoenas for records and witness testimony. They have also weighed an obstruction of justice charge centered on the president’s efforts to obstruct former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Mueller’s findings in the second volume of his report, focused on obstruction, are repeatedly referenced in the report accompanying their resolution laying out the impeachment inquiry.”



Mulvaney defies subpoena - Fox News: “Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Friday defied a subpoena to appear before House committees for a deposition as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Mulvaney was called to testify on Friday at 9 a.m., but did not show up. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., subpoenaed Mulvaney after the White House rejected the original request for him to appear. Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Oversight Committee Acting Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., had wanted to hear from the top White House official, claiming he had ‘substantial first-hand knowledge and information’ relevant to the inquiry.”



Drucker: Republicans see Mark Meadows angling for Mulvaney’s job - WashEx: “There is growing talk on Capitol Hill that Mark Meadows is angling to become the next White House chief of staff amid signs President Trump has been unhappy with the current acting holder of the position, Mick Mulvaney. The conservative Republican congressman in recent days accompanied Trump to New York to attend a mixed martial arts fight and then joined the president a couple of days later for a campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky — trips and locales with no connection to the Republican congressman’s western North Carolina House district. Meadows, like Trump, was a real estate developer before entering politics and has played a key role in defending the president against impeachment. … ‘Of course that’s what he wants,’ a Republican congressman told the Washington Examiner, requesting anonymity in order to speak candidly. At least one White House aide shares that opinion.”



Judge orders Trump to pay $2 million to charities over foundation misuse -WaPo: “A New York judge on Thursday ordered President Trump to pay $2 million in damages for misusing funds from a tax-exempt charity — taking the charity’s money to pay debts for his for-profit businesses, to boost his 2016 campaign and to buy a painting of himself, according to court documents. That order, from state Judge Saliann Scarpulla, settled a lawsuit filed against Trump last year by the New York attorney general. It marked an extraordinary moment: The president of the United States acknowledged in a court filing that he had failed to follow basic laws about how charities should be governed. Previously, Trump had insisted the charity was run properly and the suit was a partisan sham. ‘Mr. Trump owed fiduciary duties to the Foundation,’ Scarpulla wrote in the order, meaning duties to safeguard the foundation’s money. ‘Mr. Trump breached his fiduciary duty to the Foundation.’”



OUTSIDE GROUPS SWAMP VULNERABLE GOP SENATORS

Politico: “A quartet of new nonprofit groups has already spent millions of dollars hammering four of the most vulnerable Republican senators on the ballot next year, sparking a wave of concern among strategists trying to protect the GOP’s slim three-seat Senate majority in 2020. Outside groups in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Iowa have already spent or booked over $1 million in each state — and in some cases much more, according to Advertising Analytics — on advertising criticizing the senators, more than doubling the spending from Republican-aligned groups trying to respond. And in one state, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) has faced the onslaught without any backup from Republican allies. … [The U.S. Chamber of Commerce] is partnering with state affiliates to boost Sens. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) with six-figure ad buys amid the spending deluge against them, running positive ads focused on local issues there and in North Carolina, where Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) faces a primary and a general election challenge.”



Pressure grows on Bevin to put up proof or concede - Lexington [Ky.] Herald Leader: “A growing number of Republican lawmakers are urging Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a fellow Republican, to either provide evidence of the voting ‘irregularities’ he has alleged or concede Tuesday’s election to Gov.-elect Andy Beshear, who defeated him by 5,189 votes. ‘The best thing to do, the right thing to do, is for Governor Bevin to concede the election today so we can move on,’ said Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville. … Bevin bolstered that speculation Wednesday by claiming that thousands of absentee ballots were counted illegally without presenting any proof to back up his claim. Republicans in the legislature aren’t buying it.Nemes said he has not seen much support for an election challenge among his Republican colleagues in the House, largely because the governor has not backed up his claims. None of the lawmakers the Herald-Leader spoke to Thursday said they had seen evidence to support Bevin’s claims.”



GOP candidate in Louisiana’s governor’s race sees fundraising boost - AP: “Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is raking in more campaign cash after becoming the lone GOP contender in the Louisiana governor’s race against Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. Rispone, owner of an industrial contracting firm, had largely self-financed his campaign in the primary election as he competed with another Republican, U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, for dollars. But that’s changing since Rispone reached the Nov. 16 runoff and the competition between the Republican challenger and the Deep South’s only Democratic governor tightened. Finance reports filed with the state ethics administration office Wednesday night show Rispone raised just under $3 million from donors in the latest period, which began shortly before the primary election and ended Oct. 27.”

THANKSGIVING COULDN’T COME AT A BETTER TIME

News 12 New Jersey: “Wild turkeys are running amok at an over-55 community in Ocean County [N.J.]. Residents say turkeys in a large flock are blocking their doorways, pecking at cars and behaving aggressively. ‘I can't get out of my door,’ says one resident. ‘Sometimes I can't get out of my car. They go to attack you.’ Just in time for Thanksgiving, an aggressive gaggle of 40 to 60 wild turkeys is terrorizing the community in the Holiday City section of town. Residents say that shooing the birds away doesn't help, and that they actually bite. Some say that the turkeys have even broken windows in people's houses. Meanwhile, Toms River says its animal control officers are powerless to stop the turkeys because they are not licensed to trap wildlife. A spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection said that Fish and Game is aware of the situation but did not have further information or comment.”

“Of all the great imperial powers, America is probably the least imperially minded. Britain and France, at their height, would have stayed in the Gulf after such an extraordinary military victory to rearrange the map and establish themselves as hegemons. The United States, in contrast, could not wait to get out and go home.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in The New Republic on July 29, 1991.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., testify in a closed-door setting, claiming he is a ""fact witness"" in the impeachment inquiry against President Trum…",2019-11-09,Fox News,Nunes demands Schiff testify in private as 'fact witness' in impeachment inquiry,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nunes-demands-schiff-testify-in-private-as-fact-witness-in-impeachment-inquiry,"EXCLUSIVE: The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee has formally requested that the panel's chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., testify in a closed-door setting as part of the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

Fox News has obtained a letter written by committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who demanded that Schiff appear for a deposition in private before lawmakers.

""On November 6th, you announced the beginning of public hearings associated with the Democratic Party's partisan impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump,"" Nunes wrote Friday. ""Based on the precedent and lack of jurisdiction, the House Intelligence Committee should not take the lead in conducting such hearings; however, by now the American people know your desire to see the duly-elected president removed from office outweighs your sense of responsibility to running a functioning intelligence oversight committee.

""Prior to the start of your public show trial next week, at least one additional closed-door deposition must take place,"" he continued. ""Specifically, I request that you sit for a closed-door deposition before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees.""

Nunes went on to note that in August 2019, Schiff and his staff ""met with or talked to the whistleblower who raised an issue with President Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President [Volodymyr] Zelensky.""

""Although you publicly claim nothing inappropriate was discussed, the three committees deserve to hear directly from you the substance and circumstances surrounding any discussions conducted with the whistleblower, and any instructions you issued regarding those discussions,"" Nunes wrote. ""Given that you have reneged on your public commitment to let the committees interview the whistleblower directly, you are the only individual who can provide clarity as to these conversations.""

BOLTON LAWYER TEASES KNOWLEDGE ABOUT UKRAINE NOT YET MADE PUBLIC IN LETTER TO CONGRESS

He added: ""As you know, the House Intelligence Committee has precedent for such an arrangement. During the Committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, sitting Members of Congress agreed to participate in closed-door depositions. Given your championing of such an arrangement two years ago, you should have no problem with you appearing before the three committees to discuss your interactions with the whistleblower.""

Schiff maintains that he has not personally spoken with the anonymous whistleblower. However, it was revealed several weeks ago that the whistleblower had early contact with his office, essentially giving them a heads-up about the complaint concerning Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky.

Meanwhile, Republicans are expected to release a full list of proposed witnesses for testimony in a public setting in the coming days.

Nunes’ and Republicans’ effort to devise a strategy going forward comes after the House approved rules for the impeachment inquiry process last week. While Republicans opposed the resolution and complained the rules were unfair, Democrats still gave GOP lawmakers the ability to subpoena witnesses with the concurrence of Democratic committee chairs. If the chair does not consent, the minority can appeal to the full committee.

BOLTON WARNED OF 'HAND GRENADE' GIULIANI, SHUT DOWN UKRAINE MEETING, AIDE TOLD IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

This process still gives Democrats final say over witnesses. A GOP source told Fox News this week that it's unlikely Democrats would go along with the efforts to call Schiff -- who is essentially leading the impeachment probe.

The source told Fox News that Republicans want answers to questions like: “How many times did he [Schiff] meet with the whistleblower? What did they advise the whistleblower to do? How much was Schiff involved in this? Did he recommend the whistleblower give the complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, even though there was no intel component so that he could be involved?”

But GOP lawmakers for days had telegraphed that they were interested in making the attempt.

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that Schiff is the ""first person"" who should be brought in, along with his staff.

Last week, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., publicly challenged Schiff to come before the judiciary panel.

“Come to the Judiciary Committee,"" Collins said after the passage of the impeachment rules resolution. ""Be the first witness and take every question asked of you. Starting with your own involvement [with] the whistleblower.”

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FLAGGED HUNTER BIDEN'S 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST' IN UKRAINE, TESTIMONY SHOWS

Schiff’s office last month said that the whistleblower had reached out to them before filing the complaint in mid-August, giving Democrats advance warning of the accusations that would lead them to launch the inquiry days later. The inspector general's complaint about Trump’s phone call with Zelensky flagged concerns about efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.

A transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his congressional allies deny, and plan to continue to deny, that military aid was clearly linked to the request, or that there was any ""quid pro quo."" Some witnesses who have appeared before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.

Meanwhile, Republicans are also hoping to call the whistleblower to testify, according to the source, who pointed to Schiff’s recent reversal on the issue.

Schiff in September had promised testimony from the whistleblower “very soon."" But in recent weeks has suggested that testimony is unnecessary.

Meanwhile, Schiff announced Wednesday that his committee would hold the first open hearings of the impeachment inquiry next week, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.

“On Wednesday, November 13, 2019, we will hear from [U.S. charge d'affaires for Ukraine] William Taylor and [diplomat] George Kent,” Schiff announced. “On Friday, November 15, 2019, we will hear from [former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine] Marie Yovanovitch."
21,Brooke Singman,"EXCLUSIVE:House Republicans plan to call Hunter Biden, the Ukraine whistleblower and a range of other witnesses to testify in the upcoming public Trump impeachment hearings, according to a witness list obtained exclusively by Fox News.
It is unclear, at this… [+8684 chars]",House Republicans will call a number of high profile officials to testify in a public setting as part of the formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump.,2019-11-09,Fox News,"Republicans want Hunter Biden, Ukraine whistleblower as impeachment inquiry witnesses",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-hunter-biden-ukraine-whisteleblower-impeachment-witness,"EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans plan to call Hunter Biden, the Ukraine whistleblower and a range of other witnesses to testify in the upcoming public Trump impeachment hearings, according to a witness list obtained exclusively by Fox News.

It is unclear, at this point, how many of the Republicans’ proposed witnesses will be approved by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and the Democrats, because the newly-approved resolution governing the impeachment inquiry give the approval power to the chairman and the members of the majority.

""Americans see through this sham impeachment process, despite the Democrats' efforts to retroactively legitimize it last week,"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes wrote in a letter to Schiff on Saturday, referencing the impeachment rules.

""To provide transparency to your otherwise opaque and unfair process, and after consultation with [House Oversight Committee] Ranking Member Jim Jordan and [House Foreign Affairs Committee] Ranking Member Michael McCaul, the American people deserve to hear from the following witnesses in an open setting,"" he continued.

At the top of Republicans’ list is former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, who has emerged as a central figure in the Ukraine controversy due to his business dealings.

The impeachment inquiry began when a whistleblower reported that Trump had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine—specifically, why former Vice President Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter held a lucrative role on the board, bringing in a reported $50,000 per month.

Republicans noted that in testimony from former State Department official George Kent raised concerns about ""the appearance of a conflict of interest stemming from Mr. Biden's position on Burisma's board,"" and added that former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich was prepared by the Obama State Department to address questions about Mr. Biden's position on Burisma during her Senate confirmation process.

MULVANEY SEEKS TO JOIN LAWSUIT QUESTIONING HOUSE SUBPOENA POWER, SIDESTEPPING IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY

At the time, the former vice president was running U.S.-Ukraine policy under former President Barack Obama.

Republicans also plan to call the younger Biden's former long-time business partner, Devon Archer, who also sat on the board of Burisma. Republicans claim Archer can help the public to understand ""the nature and extent of Ukraine's pervasive corruption information that bears directly on President Trump's longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country.""

On Saturday, Schiff said in a statement that the Intelligence Committee was evaluating the GOP request and would ""give due consideration to witnesses within the scope of the impeachment inquiry, as voted on by the House.""

“This inquiry is not, and will not serve, however, as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit, or to facilitate the President’s effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm,” he said.

Fox News has also learned that Republicans plan to call the whistleblower—whose identity remains anonymous—to testify publicly as part of the inquiry. Schiff said in September the whistleblower would appear before Congress “very soon,” but in recent weeks has suggested that testimony is unnecessary.

""Because President Trump should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers, the anonymous whistleblower should testify,"" Nunes wrote. ""Moreover, given the multiple discrepancies between the whistleblower's complaint and the closed-door testimony of the witnesses, it is imperative that the American people hear definitively how the whistleblower developed his or her information, and who else the whistleblower may have fed the information he or she gathered and how that treatment of classified information may have led to the false narrative being perpetrated by the Democrats during this process.""

Republicans are also requesting that the ""more than half a dozen sources"" the whistleblower cited in their complaint to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, whose identities also remain anonymous, attend for a public deposition.

NIKKI HALEY SAYS TRUMP DOES NOT DESERVE 'DEATH PENALTY' IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS

In addition, Republicans also are expected to call Alexandra Chalupa as a witness. Chalupa was a Ukrainian-American consultant for the Democratic National Committee who allegedly had meetings with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C. to discuss incriminating information about Trump campaign officials during the 2016 presidential election.

Chalupa was first brought into the conversation in January 2017, after Politico published a report exposing her as a DNC operative, who worked in the Clinton White House and met with officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in an effort to expose ties between former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Russia.

""Given President Trump's documented belief that the Ukrainian government meddled in the 2016 election to oppose his candidacy, which forms the basis for a reasonable desire for Ukraine to investigate the circumstances surrounding the election and any potential Ukrainian involvement, Ms. Chalupa is a prime fact witness who can assist Congress and the American public in better understanding the facts and circumstances surrounding Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election,"" Nunes wrote.

JIM JORDAN ASSIGNED TO INTEL COMMITTEE AHEAD OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Also included in the list obtained by Fox News is Nellie Ohr—a researcher at opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned the now–infamous anti-Trump dossier, and was paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through law firm Perkins Coie. Ohr and her husband, DOJ official Bruce Ohr, were critical figures in Republicans’ efforts to investigate the origin of the Russia probe. Republicans are calling Nellie Ohr to testify because in October 2018, she told congressional investigators that Fusion GPS was getting information from Ukrainian sources.

""In a 2018 interview with the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, Ms. Ohr stated that, during her work with Fusion GPS that ultimately assisted in the production of the Steele Dossier—comprising false allegations against then-candidate Trump—Fusion GPS used information from sources in Ukraine, including Serhiy Leshchenko who recently lost his post from the Ukrainian parliament,"" Nunes wrote, noting that Ohr is a ""prime fact witness.""

Nunes, in his letter, said that he and Republicans ""expect that you will call each of the witnesses listed above to ensure that the Democrats’ “impeachment inquiry” treats the President with fairness, as promised by Speaker Pelosi.""

""Because the Democrats’ resolution unfairly restricts Minority rights and because you have provided no information about which witnesses you may invite to testify at future hearings not yet scheduled, we reserve our right to request additional witnesses, if necessary, as you announce additional hearings,"" he added. ""Your failure to fulfill Minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process.""

Meanwhile, Republicans will also call several officials that Democrats on the impeachment committees have already received testimony from—including ex-National Security Council official Tim Morrison, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, and high-ranking State Department official David Hale.

The House approved formal rules for the impeachment inquiry process last week. While Republicans opposed the resolution and complained the rules were unfair, they still gave minority Republicans the ability to subpoena witnesses, with the concurrence of Democratic committee chairs. If the chair does not consent, the minority can appeal to the full committee.

This process still gives Democrats final say over witnesses.

NUNES DEMANDS SCHIFF TESTIFY IN PRIVATE AS PART OF HOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Schiff, who is leading much of the impeachment inquiry, announced Wednesday that his committee would hold its first open hearings next week, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.

“Next week, the House Intelligence Committee will hold its first open hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry,” Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted Wednesday.

""You're going to impeach a president for asking for a favor that didn't happen and -- and giving money and it wasn't withheld? I don't know what you would impeach him on."" — Nikki Haley

Last week, the House approved rules for an already ongoing impeachment inquiry that stemmed from an anonymous intelligence community whistleblower’s complaint about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

A transcript of the call released by the Justice Department showed Trump urged Zelensky to probe Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who was reportedly making seven figures working for a Ukrainian natural gas company. The redacted memo also does not show any quid pro quo.

""When you look at the transcript, there's nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president,"" Haley said.

O'Donnell then interjected: ""To be clear, it was not a complete transcript. There are still things that are missing from it. And in it, he does say, 'I would like you to do us a favor,' though.""

""When you look at the transcript, there's nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president."" — Nikki Haley

""The Ukrainians never did the investigation,"" Haley continued. ""And the president released the funds. I mean, when you look at those, there's just nothing impeachable there. And more than that, I think the -- the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why do we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?""

Congress has been conducting closed-door interviews with several witnesses in order to determine whether Trump initially withheld congressionally approved military aid for Ukraine as a form of leverage to force Zelensky to launch the probe against Biden, who is a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, and, therefore, Trump’s political rival."

""I think Michael Bloomberg saw that opportunity and made a pretty intelligent decision,"" he added. ""For him, it’s now or never in terms of running for president, so why not get in and shake up the Democratic Party.""

Trump commented on Bloomberg's possible candidacy and predicted that he will fail miserably if he attempts to enter the race. He also claimed there's no other candidate he would rather face than, ""little Michael.""

""He's not going to do well. But I think he's going to hurt Biden actually, but he doesn't have the magic to do well,"" Trump told reporters on Friday. ""Little Michael will fail. He'll spend a lot of money. He's got some really big issues. He's got some personal problems and he's got a lot of other problems.

""But I know Michael Bloomberg fairly well,"" he continued. ""He will not do very well, and if he did I'd be happy. There is nobody I'd rather run against than little Michael. That I can tell you.""

Penn said if Biden overperforms in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, he may fend off the challenge from Bloomberg, especially if Bloomberg is unable to obtain time on the debate stage.

""Biden's going to have a test in Iowa and New Hampshire,"" he said. ""If Biden doesn’t come through that test... that's going to present a clear field for Bloomberg... If Biden does particularly well in those two states, that might block the Bloomberg effort... So a lot of pressure is put on the Biden campaign now to deliver in the early states.""

""I think the big question is whether Bloomberg will be put into the debates or not, regardless of his polling numbers,"" Penn added. ""He needs 165,000 small donors... the Democratic Party says if you don’t have 165,000 small donors, you don’t qualify for the debates, and that is a problem for Michael Bloomberg.""

Penn also said Trump's chances of winning reelection hinge on his support in the suburbs, but said it's impossible to tell which way suburban voters will break, come 2020.

""The country is in the middle of a realignment. The Republicans had strongholds in the suburbs and were weak with working-class,"" he said. ""Donald Trump comes in, wins the election with a combination of suburban and working-class voters... but he's been losing the suburbs. And that’s where you see election after election and in the midterms, the suburbs went over to the Democrats. The Democrats are changing as a party, so [are the Republicans]. Is that permanent, will it last? That I couldn’t tell you."""

Republicans submitted a list of witnesses they would like to call, which is already creating controversy. Among those on the list is Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who was one of the subjects Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help investigate, as the younger Biden was a board member of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.

DEM LEADER TELLS GOP TO 'GET LOST' OVER IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITNESS LIST

“I would love to hear from Hunter Biden, I would love to hear from the other Americans who served on the board of Burisma,” House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, told “Fox News Sunday,” questioning how someone with no experience with Ukraine or natural gas would end up on the board of the company.

Ukrainian officials had been investigating Burisma while Joe Biden was vice president, only for the probe to end after the elder Biden pressured Ukraine into firing the prosecutor in charge. The reason for the firing has been a point of debate, and is a key part of the investigation Trump discussed with Zelensky.

Another committee member, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., appeared later in the program and dismissed the need for calling Hunter Biden to testify.

“He has no knowledge of what the president did or didn’t do here,” Maloney said. Trump’s request from Ukraine for assistance in investigating political rivals is at the center of the impeachment inquiry, after a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky inspired an anonymous whistleblower complaint.

Democrats have claimed the call was part of an attempted quid pro quo in exchange for withheld U.S. military aid and a White House meeting between Zelensky and Trump. Trump has denied the claim, saying the call was “perfect,” and Zelensky has said there was no pressure.

One thing that Hurd and Maloney agreed on was that the whistleblower should not be called to testify. Hurd spoke out against this, going against the members of his party who included the whistleblower on their list.

“I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistleblower; I’ve said that from the very beginning,” Hurd said, “because how we treat this whistleblower will impact whistleblowers in the future.”

Hurd did call for Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to answer questions about his office’s interactions with the whistleblower before Congress found out about the allegations contained in the complaint.

“He has misled the American public earlier in the year on what he knew about or the contact he had with the whistleblower, so if you want to protect the identity of the whistleblower, I think it’s important for Chairman Schiff to answer questions about his interactions.”

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Hakeem Jeffries rejected the GOP’s witness list on Twitter, telling them to “GET LOST,” but Maloney did not dismiss it outright.

BOLTON LAWYER TEASES KNOWLEDGE ABOUT UKRAINE NOT YET MADE PUBLIC IN LETTER TO CONGRESS

“I think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list,” he said, although the only ones he named were individuals who have already appeared in closed-door interviews, such as former U.S. Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and National Security Council official Tim Morrison.

One witness House Democrats called to testify was former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has been quoted as referring to a U.S. agreement with Ukraine regarding investigations as a “drug deal.” Bolton failed to appear, and his attorney Charles Cooper said Bolton would only appear if ordered by a judge, which would happen if Bolton is ordered to comply with a subpoena. So far, however, Democrats have not issued a subpoena for Bolton.

Cooper said in a letter to the top lawyer for the House of Representatives on Friday that Bolton and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, are seeking a ""definitive judgment from the Judicial Branch determining their constitutional duty in the face of conflicting demands"" from the White House and Congress.

Cooper’s letter said Bolton was involved in “many relevant meetings and conversations” to the impeachment inquiry.”

Maloney said “we sure do” want Bolton to appear, but would not say why Democrats would not subpoena him.

Speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Swalwell – a member of the House Intelligence Committee – said that while President Trump is owed his due process rights, he believes the evidence shows the administration using taxpayer dollars to investigate Trump’s political opponents in the 2020 election.

“It’s important that the president has due process, and evidence is not a conclusion,” Swalwell said. “We have enough evidence from the depositions that we’ve done to warrant bringing this forward, evidence of an extortion scheme using taxpayer dollars to ask a foreign government to investigate the president’s opponents.""

Swalwell added: “It’s important that these witnesses raise their right hands and take questions from both Republicans and Democrats… It’s important that the Republicans are afforded the opportunity to suggest which witnesses we should call and we’ll decide whether that’s relevant.”

Swalwell also lambasted Republican calls for the former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, to come before the House – saying that “we’re not going to go back in time and revisit conspiracy theories that were implicated in the president’s call.”

Trump has sought to implicate Biden and his son, Hunter, in his July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.

The first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry are scheduled to be held next Wednesday and Friday, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.

The first public hearing will feature Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who already testified behind closed doors before congressional investigators that the president pushed Ukraine to investigate election interference, Biden and his son and their Ukrainian dealings — and that he was told U.S. military aid and a White House meeting were used as leverage to get a public announcement from Kiev that the probes were underway.

George Kent, the deputy assistant Secretary of State, also will appear with Taylor. Kent testified behind closed doors last month, and told the committees that he had concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, in 2015, but was rebuffed by the former vice president’s staff, which said the office was preoccupied with Beau Biden’s cancer battle."

Bolton was represented by the Javelin literary agency, whose clients include former FBI Director James Comey and the anonymous Trump administration official whose book, ""A Warning,"" comes out Nov. 19. Neither Javelin nor Simon & Schuster responded to Fox News requests for comment.

The conservative Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Bolton's 2007 book ""Surrender is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad.""

Bolton, a foreign policy hawk, left the White House in September over clashes with President Trump, who said he fired Bolton because he ""disagreed strongly"" with his suggestions. Bolton quickly challenged Trump's assertion, saying he had offered to resign.

The two disagreed on a number of national security issues, including the plans for a drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

BOLTON WARNED OF 'HAND GRENADE' GIULIANI, SHUT DOWN UKRAINE MEETING, AIDE TOLD IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Bolton has returned to the spotlight during the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump's request of his Ukrainian counterpart to ""look into” former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's dealings in the Eastern European country. The probe stems from a whistleblower complaint about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky during which Democrats claim Trump offered a ""quid pro quo"" in exchange for withheld U.S. military aid.

Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, said in a letter to the top lawyer for the House of Representatives Friday that his client was involved in ""many relevant meetings and conversations"" to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, but suggested that Bolton will only appear before Congress if a judge orders it.

A former top White House expert on Russia, Fiona Hill, testified that Bolton had warned that Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was a ""hand grenade"" who was ""going to blow up everyone,"" and distanced himself from the efforts to leverage Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, according to transcripts released Friday.

Hill also described how Bolton had ""immediately stiffened"" as Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland ""blurted out"" that he had worked out a trade -- the Ukrainians' probe for an Oval Office welcome for Kiev's new president -- with Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. According to Hill, Bolton later told her that ""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up"" and asked her to relay that message to a White House lawyer.

Appointed in April 2018, Bolton was Trump's third national security adviser. In a speech in late September to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, given after he left the administration, Bolton offered a far more aggressive approach to North Korea's nuclear program than the one advocated by Trump, who has spoken warmly about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

""Every day that goes by makes North Korea a more dangerous country,"" Bolton said. ""You don't like their behavior today, what do you think it will be when they have nuclear weapons that can be delivered to American cities?""

Hanson claimed Friday on ""The Story"" that if Bloomberg seeks the same political lane as former Vice President Joe Biden, the Delaware Democrat appears to be a better fit for party centrists.

Biden, 76, can successfully play to his ""Good Old Joe From Scranton [Pa.]"" image and appeal to the white working-class, Hanson claimed.

The 77-year-old Bloomberg, on the other hand, has become well-known as a supporter of gun control and memorably campaigned against super-sized soft drinks while mayor of the Big Apple.

BLOOMBERG MOVE UNDERSCORES DEMOCRATIC PARTY PANIC OVER 2020 FIELD

""When you look at the issues that Bloomberg has advocated -- restrictions on the Second Amendment or 'nanny-state' intrusiveness into everything from plastic straws to super-sized drinks, climate change, open borders, sort of traditional engagement with China -- that's not the issues that won Donald Trump those swing states [in 2016],"" Hanson said.

""So, I don't quite see the logic.""

However, the Hoover Institution fellow also credited Bloomberg with being one of the richest men in the world, a ""master"" of media and well-informed on the issues.

""He was a Republican that won in New York -- which is an achievement, but other than that, he's got a lot of liabilities.""

Bloomberg won two mayoral elections in New York City as a Republican and won a third term as an independent before joining the Democratic ranks. He succeeded current Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, a Republican, as mayor and preceded incumbent Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.

In a recent statement, Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson said the ex-mayor is concerned about the current Democratic field and claimed his influx of resources into this week's Virginia state elections shows he is actively working to help the party. Wolfson noted Virginia's previously Republican-controlled House of Delegates and State Senate flipped to the blue column Tuesday.

""In 2018 [Bloomberg] spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable,"" Wolfson said. ""And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature.

On ""The Story,"" Hanson claimed Bloomberg lacks the charisma of other candidates -- which could hurt him in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and other key states Trump hopes to win.

“Jim Jordan has been in all these depositions and been part of it,” McCarthy said during an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “But [Adam Schiff] is trying to control everything.”

McCarthy announced on Friday that Jordan, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee and a staunch defender of President Trump, would temporarily replace Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., for the duration of the hearings.

“Jim Jordan has been on the front lines in the fight for fairness and truth. His addition will ensure more accountability and transparency in this sham process,"" McCarthy said in a statement on Friday.

Under current terms, Jordan, as the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, has been in the room for most closed-door depositions. Because he is not a member of the Intelligence Committee, though, the Ohio Republican cannot ask questions.

A senior House Democratic aide tells Fox News that Democrats allowed the personnel shift because “it is customary that whoever the minority proposes is accepted.”

Jordan would not have been on the dais during open hearings this week to counterpunch. Republican leadership all week had been weighing the Jordan move, and considering adding Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., as well. But in order to position Jordan on the panel, Republican leadership is required to remove one of the current Republicans on the panel. Removing three, to also include Meadows and Zeldin, would be somewhat of a feat.

Meanwhile, next Friday, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, will appear in a public setting. She testified last month behind closed doors as well, telling lawmakers that Ukraine told her about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s campaign to oust her from her post in the administration. Yovanovitch was pushed out of her job in May on Trump’s orders.

Yovanovitch said she learned from Ukrainian officials last November or December that Giuliani was in touch with Ukraine’s former top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, “and that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me.”

The impeachment inquiry was opened after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.

A transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any quid pro quo. Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.

The White House, though, has maintained the president did nothing wrong.

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

The House Democratic effort to impeach President Trump moves into a key new phase this week, public hearings, in which career government officials will testify on camera about how President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The big question: will this change the dynamic of the inquiry that so far has remained strictly partisan?

In a moment, we'll speak with two members of the House Intelligence Committee that will hold the made-for-TV hearings, Republican Will Hurd and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

But, first, let's bring in Ellison Barber, who has the latest from the White House -- Ellison.

ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, one of the first witnesses we expect to hear from this week is a career diplomat who testified behind closed doors. It was his understanding that everything, military aid and an Oval Office visit, was contingent on Ukraine investigating the Bidens in 2016.

BARBER: The 45th president cheered at the game of the century hours before the start of the week that could turn his political future upside down. Three public hearings are set to take place on two different dates. On Wednesday, the House Intelligence Committee will hear from a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine and a top State Department official. On Friday, the former ambassador to Ukraine.

House Democrats released their closed door testimonies this week. William Taylor's arguably the most explosive. The career the diplomat testified it was his clear understanding security assistance money would not come until the president of Ukraine committed to pursue the investigations President Trump wanted.

BARBER: Rules approved by the House essentially give Democrats veto power here. It witnesses must be approved by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee or the full committee -- Chris.

WALLACE: Ellison Barber, reporting from the White House -- Ellison, thank you.

BARBER: You bet.

WALLACE: Joining me now, Congressman Will Hurd, a Republican member of the House Intel Committee that will conduct those public hearings this week.

Congressman Hurd, the top Republican on House Intel, Devin Nunes, says that he would like to call the whistle-blower, the unnamed whistle-blower, to testify in public in these hearings.

And here's what President Trump has to say about the whistle-blower.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The whistle-blower is a disgrace to our country, a disgrace, and the whistle-blower, because of that, should be revealed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Now, the whistle-blower reportedly works for the CIA, where you worked for almost a decade.

Should his identity be revealed? Should be he called to testify in public?

REP. WILL HURD, R-TX: I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistle-blower. I've said that from the very beginning, because how we treat this whistle-blower will impact whistle-blowers in the future. Having this whistle-blower law on the books is important. It's an important checks and balance not only in the Intelligence Committee, but our government.

But what I do would like to see happen is for Adam Schiff, Chairman Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, to answer questions about what was his engagement with the whistle-blower before the information, his (ph) -- the whistle-blower's allegations were transmitted to the -- to Congress.

He has misled the American public earlier in the year on what he knew about -- or the contact that he had with the whistle-blower. So if you want to protect the identity of the whistle-blower, I think it's important for Chairman Schiff to answer questions about his interactions with them (ph).

WALLACE: What to think about as the Republicans are seeking, calling Hunter Biden, the vice president -- the former vice president's son, as a witness?

HURD: I would love to hear from Hunter Biden, I would love to hear from other Americans that served on the board of Burisma. I'm curious to know of someone who doesn't have any experience in Ukraine nor experience in a natural gas company becomes (ph) on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine.

You know, this is -- we also need to hear and understand the corruption. We know corruption in the Ukraine is an issue. And Ambassador Taylor has said that in his testimony. Dr. Hill has said that in her testimony. This is something that was a concern even in this current new administration in Ukraine.

So, hearing from people that can help provide insights into that, since that is, you know, central to this conversation would be -- would be valuable.

WALLACE: Now, Congressman Schiff responded last night to the GOP witness list that had been offered by Chairman Nunes and here's what Schiff said: The Intel Committee will not be used, quote, to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens and 2016 that the president wanted Ukraine to conduct.

Given that response, Congressman Hurd, what does that say about the fairness of a process that the Democrats are running and holding these hearings?

HURD: Unfortunately, Chris, this has been a partisan exercise from the very beginning. When one piece of information comes, people that don't like the president say, oh, this is an example for impeachment. People that support the president say, this is a -- you know, evidence of an exoneration.

I think we should just turn over every rock and pursue every lead to ultimately get to the truth. And it's unfortunate that the Democrats on the committee and the Democrats in the House have created this partisan exercise.

In a normal hearing, the minority, the folks that are not in power, have the ability to offer a witness. We can't do that in this case.

Under previous impeachment inquiries, the minority and the president has had the opportunity to call witnesses, be involved.

You -- the majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman Schiff has prevented some of the lawyers for the administration to come in and be there with the folks that were -- that were testifying. That's not a fair process.

If we're interested in trying to uncover the truth, then let's not -- let's not put our thumb on the scale. But unfortunately, that's what this process has been and what's even crazier is there trying to have this completed by the end of the year, and I think we only have 16 or 17 legislative days left in the year. Half of those days are what's called ""fly-in, fly-out"" days where people are coming in from their location.

So, to try to get that, try to pass NAFTA, to fund the government -- to try to do all that in that short period of time, I think that's next to impossible.

WALLACE: You -- you talk about the extreme partisanship, maybe on both sides, Republicans and Democrats. You are not -- while you're supportive of the president, you are not a party line supportive. You oppose some of his policies, for instance, constructing the border wall. You've opposed and have spoken out against some of his language during his time in office.

For you, what specifically do you want to learn from these hearings?

HURD: So, I think talk about impeachment has been premature. I think impeachment is one of the most important and consequential things a member of Congress can do. And I think there's 535 different opinions on what impeachment is. To evaluate -- to evaluate that question I think it's a violation of the law.

So, I want to see, does this establish a criminal intent? And yes, for me, I agree when I agree, I disagree when I disagree.

And having spent nine-and-a-half years as an undercover officer in the CIA, I was a guy in the back alleys collecting intelligence. I also did this to embassies. I know how embassies work.

And the fact that Ukrainian officials weren't contacting their U.S. counterparts until August 29th, when they read in -- I believe it was a political article about aid being withheld. That was the first time that any Ukrainian had contacted a State Department or government official about this. That was more than a month after the July 25th phone call between the president and President Zelensky.

WALLACE: So --

(CROSSTALK)

HURD: What do I want to see?

WALLACE: Go ahead, sir.

HURD: Go ahead, Chris.

WALLACE: No, you go ahead.

HURD: What -- what I want to see is their inability to establish criminal intent. Do the Ukrainians know that this -- you know, this was some kind of a quid pro quo?

You know, when you look at our relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine over the last three years, there's been no more aid going to Ukraine this year than -- in this administration than the previous administration. Ukraine is an important partner.

WALLACE: Let me ask you specifically though about this because there seem to be two issues that were part of the quid pro quo. One was military aid. One was the meeting that the Ukrainians very much wanted between their President Zelensky and President Trump.

All three of the witnesses that are going to testify this week -- you see them up there, William Taylor, George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch, all career foreign service officers, said there was a clear connection between support for Ukraine, at various forms of the U.S. support for Ukraine, and Ukraine investigating the Democrats.

If you are satisfied that that is true, that there was this connection, this nexus, is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: Well, I don't know if it was necessarily investigate the Democrats, right? I think it was investigation of corruption. And so, people have made assumption of what is --

WALLACE: Forgive me, sir, but specifically --

HURD: Sure.

WALLACE: -- what President Trump said on that July 25th phone call was investigate the Democratic role in the 2016 election, whether they were involved in hacking the DNC server and also, specifically, the Bidens and Burisma.

HURD: Well, on the 2016 elections -- now, some of that information was based on what has been kind of fringe thinking. But back when even Democrats start investigating the Russian involvement on 2016 elections, there was a Ukraine nexus.

And so, trying to get to the bottom of that, is that a violation of the law? Now, was that an understanding based on debunked information? Yes. But is that a violation of the law? I don't think so.

You mentioned of the Bidens --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But specifically, sir, the question, is if there was a quid pro quo, U.S. aid for Ukraine was going to depend on their doing these investigations of political rivals of the president. Is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing. I think everybody has -- most Republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law.

WALLACE: So, that, in your view, if that were established to your satisfaction, if, I repeat, that would be an impeachable offense?

HURD: I believe that's something that would make it -- make it -- have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.

WALLACE: And we will see what happens this week and whether or not it persuades you.

Congressman Hurd, thank you so much. Thanks for your time. Good to talk with you, sir.

HURD: Thank you, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll get reaction from a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee about what some say is his party's timetable to impeach the president before the end of the year.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: House Republicans have complained for weeks about Democrats interviewing key witnesses in the impeachment probe behind closed doors. Well, now, the public hearings are about to start. The GOP is still complaining.

Let's bring in Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.

Congressman, as I discussed with Congressman Hurd, Republicans have now put out their written list of witnesses. It includes Hunter Biden, the unnamed whistle-blower, and Nellie Ohr, who folks may remember, she worked for Fusion GPS, which sought information from sources in Ukraine in 2016 and put up the Steele dossier.

Will Democrats agree to call any of these witnesses? And if you don't, what does that say about the fairness of this entire proceeding?

REP. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, D-N.Y.: Well, I can't speak for the chairman, but what I can tell you is that I think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list. And here's my test -- my test is, do these witnesses have important information, knowledge, or evidence about the president's conduct? And if it passes that test, then we should call them, sure.

WALLACE: So, let's ask specifically. Hunter Biden, Nellie Ohr, the unnamed whistle-blower -- do any of them pass that test and therefore should be called?

MALONEY: The first two, no. The third one, you've just heard Congressman Hurd give a very eloquent explanation of why we don't force the revelation of a whistle-blower's identity. So, no in all three cases, but for different reasons.

WALLACE: Well, I mean, let's -- let's focus on Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden is at the center of this. There are allegations of corruption. You know, there certainly are questions why a fellow named Hunter Biden would get a big job in Ukraine when his father was then the vice president and conducting relations with Ukraine.

Isn't that a fair person to talk to?

MALONEY: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Wallace, what information Mr. Biden, Hunter Biden, a private citizen who was broke no laws by serving on the board of directors, would have about the president's withholding of military aid to Ukraine? In other words, he has no knowledge of what the president did or didn't do here, that is the subject of the impeachment inquiry.

There are certainly questions, of course, and many people have asked them, but it's not relevant to this week's hearings.

WALLACE: So, you know, I don't have the list right in front of me, but you obviously saw it. You're a member of the committee. Which member of the Republican potential witnesses would you agree to call?

MALONEY: Again, there are witnesses on the Republican list who have been interviewed in depositions already and, of course, those transcripts are going to be released fully. And so, I would expect the witnesses who have been interviewed, because they have material information, would be likely called in public, but again, those are not --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: For instance, Kurt Volker, who was a special emissary to Ukraine?

MALONEY: Mr. Volker testified for the committee, so did Mr. Morrison. Those witnesses are on the list. Mr. Hale is similarly a witness who's been interviewed, is on the list. Those are the witnesses I have in mind.

But again, this is not my decision. I can't speak for the chairman, but those witnesses do have material information about the president's conduct in this case. That's the proper focus of this inquiry.

And if I could just say, Chris, you know, I hope your viewers will keep an open mind. You know, this is Veterans Day weekend, God bless all who serve and where the country's uniform as my dad did, as my grandfather did.

You know, these are also military veterans. Ambassador Taylor was an infantry officer with 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, served in combat.

WALLACE: Right.

MALONEY: West Point graduate. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman earned a Purple Heart in Iraq.

These are -- these are veterans and credible witnesses. I hope people will keep an open mind and hear their testimony unfiltered and read the transcript. By all means, they are all coming out in public.

WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about another -- apparently non-witness at this point and that his national security advisor -- former national security advisor John Bolton. Here is what his lawyer wrote this week to the committee: Bolton was involved, according to his lawyer, in many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.

Continuing the quote: If the House chooses not to pursue through subpoena the testimony of Ambassador Bolton, let the record be clear, that is the House's decision.

Isn't -- Congressman, isn't John Bolton perhaps the best witness other than the president as to what was going on inside the Oval Office? And why on earth wouldn't you wait to see what he has to say?

MALONEY: We have -- we have invited Ambassador Bolton to appear, and that sounds like a nervous lawyer to me, because they are -- they are refusing to honor a legal request to provide relevant testimony.

WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait --

MALONEY: Excuse me --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Let me just -- wait a minute. But the point is he has gone to a judge and said, you tell us, I got an order from the White House, I got an order from Congress, you tell me what to do.

MALONEY: Right. Mr. Wallace, that's not how it works. You show up and you respond to a subpoena or you go to a judge and get it quashed, or you show up and you invoke a legitimate privilege and refused to answer a particular question.

It is unprecedented to say, you, Congress, go to a judge and tell me to appear. That's not how it works, and Ambassador Bolton is a better lawyer than that. He knows that personally.

WALLACE: Wait. That isn't what they're doing. They're not saying, Congress, go to the judge. They are going to the judge.

That's what they did with Charles Kupperman, another one of the clients who was an assistant to a deputy to Bolton and Bolton -- they are going to the judge and they're saying, judge, we've got these competing claims, you tell us what to do. They're not asking the House to do anything.

MALONEY: Mr. Wallace, I agree with you that he has important information and we would love to hear from Ambassador Bolton. I think the public deserves to hear from Ambassador Bolton, who remember call this a drug deal and wanted nothing to do with it, who instructed his subordinates to report this conversations to the lawyers at the White House because he knew they were improper.

Ambassador Bolton does have important information. I don't understand why the White House has instructed him not to cooperate. You should ask them.

WALLACE: Yes. I guess what I'm saying is this is an impeachment. This isn't just oversight. This is the potential impeachment of the president of the United States.

There is going to be a court hearing in early December, Charles Kupperman, the deputy to Bolton and Bolton now would be part of that suit.

Why not wait -- we're talking about a month, exactly a month, to find out what a judge says? Why wouldn't, when you're talking about the impeachment of the president, why wouldn't the House Intelligence Committee be willing to wait to find out such key evidence?

MALONEY: Again, we would love to have Mr. Bolton's evidence. There's nothing preventing him from giving it. But remember -- oh, and by the way, any notion that that's going to be favorable to the president I think is debunked by everything in the public domain already.

Ambassador Bolton called this a drug deal. I'm not sure the president will want to hear from Ambassador Bolton, but we sure do.

But here's the point. The point is, do we have sufficient evidence from credible witnesses that we're going to present in public testimony to move forward with an inquiry which may result in a referral to the Senate, where there will be a trial, where witnesses like Ambassador Bolton will have an opportunity again to provide the information they know. I encourage them to do it now, I encourage them to do it then and I don't think it will be favorable to the president. It is Ambassador Bolton who saw clearly how abusive and inappropriate the president's conduct was.

WALLACE: You know, he's not going to be -- testify because you guys have a timetable that you want to get this done by the end of the year.

Let me ask you a couple questions to finish this up. President Trump now says that he is going to release the transcript of a phone call -- not the July 25th a phone call that we've already seen but an earlier phone call in April just after President Zelensky was inaugurated between the two presidents.

What value does not transcript have for your committee and your investigation?

MALONEY: Well, I don't know of any evidence that would be relevant from the first phone call except that it was a routine phone call to congratulate the president. If the president wants to release it, that's fine. I don't think it's relevant to this investigation.

WALLACE: Let's turn to the public hearings this week. You've got three witnesses testifying, we've already seen the transcripts of their interviews. People know what they're going to say.

Is the argument that you're basically -- people are going to read the book but they're going to see the movie? Because that didn't work out very well in the Robert Mueller testimony.

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, the point is that the Republicans have been demanding for weeks that the public be able to see this testimony. So, you know, they should take yes for an answer. I think it's very important that the public be able to judge for itself.

And I really encourage your viewers to just watch the hearings. Read the transcripts or watch it live and make up your own minds. You won't have any filter. You won't have the press or politicians in the way. You'll have witnesses giving opening statements.

And these are military veterans. These are career nonpartisan civil servants. The first witness, Ambassador Bill Taylor --

(CROSSTALK)

MALONEY: Excuse me, is an appointee of a Republican president who serve this country in the military. I think we should give him a chance.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Sir, you've already made that point and I would like to get -- I'm running out of time, I'd like to get one last question in if I might.

Here's what President Trump says about all those witnesses. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: The testimony has all been fine. I mean, for the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are. It seems that nobody has any first-hand knowledge, there is no firsthand knowledge.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: The president does have a point. None of these officials actually talked to the president.

When we think back to John Dean with Richard Nixon, he took us into the Oval Office. He told what he told the president and what the president told him.

As the president says, all of the information we're going to hear this week is secondhand. Is that enough to impeach a president?

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, if you're talking about this week -- but, of course, there witnesses like Ambassador Sondland, who spoke directly to the president. There are other witnesses who have refused to cooperate.

By the way, the State Department has refused to produce all the notes and corroborating evidence, but there are absolutely direct witnesses to the president's phone call. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was on the call and went immediately to the embassy legal department because he knew it was wrong, what he heard. That's a military veteran.

There are a lot of people with direct knowledge and it's -- honestly, if I can say, it is heartbreaking to hear the president, any American president, deride an important process where reliable witnesses are giving information. It's also heartbreaking to realize once you see this evidence that any American president would engage in misconduct. You know, it gives me no pleasure to tell you the American president has abused his office and he should be accountable.

WALLACE: Well, as you say, people are going to get to see for themselves this week.

Congressman Maloney, thank you, thanks for joining us. And, of course, FOX News will cover the hearings this week live.

MALONEY: Thank you.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether anything will change now that the public will hear from these witnesses themselves.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Democratic front runner Joe Biden reacts to Michael Bloomberg looking at a run for the White House.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In terms of he's running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel how a Bloomberg campaign would shake up the Democratic race. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves, but also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: As we are more testimony, in fact the testimony that we're hearing today, it's actually getting easier to defend the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff and Republican Congressman Mark Meadows setting very different expectations for this week's public impeachment hearings.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff, Josh Holmes.

Congresswoman Edwards, let me start with you.

What do you expect these public hearings to accomplish? We know what these witnesses are going to say. They -- we -- they -- their opening statements were leaked. Their full hours long transcripts have been -- have been put out there for anybody who's interested to read. They've been widely covered. It doesn't seem to have moved anybody. I mean the Democrats are foursquare in favor of impeachment and there doesn't seem to have been a single vote that's been swayed so far at least by House Republicans in favor of impeachment.

So what's the point?

DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-MD: Well, I mean, now it's time for the American people to see the evidence. I mean let's admit it, even -- I've read some of the transcripts but haven't read all of them and I think for the American people to be able to see these witnesses, to know their, you know, their backgrounds and that they are public servants and that they have a sense of duty coming before the committee, and I think that that will be really compelling.

And, you know, maybe it's not about swaying individual members of Congress right now, but it's about making sure that the American people put it out there because Congress are followers, right? They'll follow the public. And I think that it's really important for the American people to hear the lawlessness and the unconstitutional behavior of the president of the United States.

WALLACE: Karl, let's talk about the -- what we're going to hear in terms of the testimony this week. You worked in a White House. We're going to hear from three career foreign service officers. One of them, William Taylor, a military veteran, has served presidents since 1985. Ronald Reagan. They're going to talk about an off the books foreign policy. They're going to talk about an ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who was smeared and recalled because of comments that were being made, a campaign being run by Rudy Giuliani, allegedly. They're going to hear about a link between U.S. support for Ukraine and Ukraine conducting investigations of the president's political rivals.

Obviously there's another side to the story, but that story, does it bother you?

KARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, as somebody who served in the White House, it does bother me, yes. But, on the other hand, there is constant friction between the State Department and an administration. We saw this during the Iraq War, where we had the people in the State Department leaking against the administration's policy. But, look, that's going to be the sideshow.

The thing that's going to happen when we have this testimony is, is that the Republicans are going to be able to ask questions. Think about where we've been. We have selective leaks of what -- of what these people said, which is done to spin it as much as possible against the president. Then we have their entire transcripts, which most people don't read. Now we're going to have televised hearings in which they're going to be able to say their piece and it's going to have an impact, but there also going to be questioned. And the questioning is going to get to, you know, we have a quid. Military aid and assistance for Ukraine. And we have a quo. And that quo is, investigative the Bidens and any other American involved in corruption. But so far we don't have the pro, the for, that is to say that what we know today is, is that the Ukrainians were never aware of a delay in their aid until they were given the aid and told that it had been delayed. And we never had that grant of the aid predicated upon them making a commitment to investigate Joe Biden.

And we're -- and the failure of the Democrats -- Schiff's statement last night was very problematic because the American people are going to want to hear about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and Devon Archer (ph) and this stinky situation involving Burisma. And if the Democrats say, we're not going to allow you to have those people called, it's just going to simply add to the impression that this is a partisan witch hunt.

WALLACE: Mo.

MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE: Ambassador Sondland did revise his testimony to say he did inform the Ukrainians that the aid would likely be contingent on this. So that's -- that's about where we are on that point.

Look, ultimately, I agree with the congresswoman, that now the American people get to see this stuff. And if you think about this politically and what actually -- you know, based on the very few precedents we have in American history on this, looking back on Richard Nixon, Republicans were with him. Republican voters were with him up until the very end. The day he left, the polling show that about 30 percent of Republicans thought he should be removed from office. But that 30 percent was a significant number because that's what put a lot of pressure on the Republican members of the Senate, when Barry Goldwater finally broke with the president and went to him and said, Mr. President, you know I've been your guy but it's become unsustainable for us. Right now you don't see that kind of breaking from Republican voters.

So the question becomes, do these hearings, as the congresswoman was saying, begin to mobilize and catalyze Republican voters? We know it's doing it for Democrats and we know it's doing it for independent voters.

WALLACE: But here's the question I have, and let me bring in Josh on this, because I understand that, you know, we pay much more attention to the leaks, we pay much more attention to the transcripts than most people do, but they are out there and they have been widely reported. They've been the lead on the evening news. They've been on the front page of the papers. And so far, Josh, it hasn't moved a single Republican vote.

JOSH HOLMES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Nor has it moved the Republican primary electorate. I mean I think, Mo, you have a good point there and what ultimately did in Nixon was his party basically beginning to turn on him. If you look at the American people right now, in particular the Republican primary electorate, not only are they not moving away from the president, it's heartening. I mean you've got numbers in 85 plus in terms of their view of this being a quote/unquote witch hunt.

So I -- look, we're a long way away from Republicans moving away from President Trump and embracing an impeachment inquiry. My guess is an open hearing in the House will only serve to exacerbate that. I don't think there's any chance that this is going to come off looking like a fair hearing or something that the president has had basically his say in.

WALLACE: I mean, that is the concern, I mean, that it hasn't moved the needle. And we've gotten a lot of information so far. I don't -- I mean I understand a TV -- well, I don't know if I understand because we -- everybody kept saying, you know, they won't read the book, they'll watch the movie and the Mueller hearing turned out to be a disaster for Democrats, I think we would agree.

So let's assume that this is more effective than Robert Mueller as a -- as a witness. Does it really move the needle? Because it hasn't so far, congresswoman.

EDWARDS: Well, look, this is actually very different kinds of behavior even than what we saw in the Mueller report. I mean we have a president of the United States who withheld aid from an ally who was, you know, on the front lines against our chief adversary. And I think when the American people here that it wasn't -- this isn't about 2016, this is about what is happening right now in 2020 prospectively for the 2020 election. And I think that these witnesses are going to make all the difference.

I mean when you look at a lieutenant colonel, Vindman, for example, you know, he'll be there and he'll be in his dress blues and, you know, fully decorated, raising his hand saying that he's telling the truth.

I defy Republicans to challenge on that. They are not challenging on the substance, they are challenging on process, and that is a loser argument.

WALLACE: All right, you get the final word.

ROVE: Process matters, fairness matters, that's why Nixon went down because the process was fair. This is not fair. They won't allow the -- they've got allowed the president any of the rights granted to President Clinton during his impeachment, or any of the rights granted to President Nixon during his impeachment.

And I love the fact -- I love the fact that the Democrats are now decrying the president's decision not to move aid -- lethal aid rapidly to Ukraine. After all, the previous administration, a Democratic administration, did nothing to send lethal aid to Ukraine and the nonlethal aid they refused to fly into Ukraine on C-130s because they didn't want U.S. military presence in Ukraine. So they drop them off in Poland and citizens had to take that nonlethal aid and put it in the back of their little vehicles and trucks and convey it to Ukraine.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: So this president at least had the guts to give the Ukrainians the lethal aid needed to stave off the Russian attempts to subvert that country.

WALLACE: Well, I think this is probably going to end up being a game changer and we're -- it will be a bipartisan game changer.

Panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg looks ready to make a late entry into the 2020 Democratic race. Can he win the nomination?

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the impact of a Bloomberg candidacy? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at “Fox News Sunday” and we may use your question on the air.

MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: There's nobody I'd rather run against the little Michael.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, sorry, you ain't gonna buy this election!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Well, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg getting pretty strong push back from both President Trump and Democratic Candidate Bernie Sanders on a possible run for the White House.

And we're back now with the panel.

Mo, let me start with you.

Does Michael Bloomberg have a realistic path to the Democratic nomination, and what do you think of what his strategists say if he does get in, and it seems likely will, his plan, skip the first four, skip Iowa, skip New Hampshire, and basically begin your campaign on Super Tuesday in early March?

ELLEITHEE: Yes, look, it's an uphill climb, I would think, for -- for Mayor Bloomberg. And there's no evidence -- we've never seen anyone who has successfully tried to skip the early states and go on to win the nomination. Not at least in the modern era. We've seen candidates who have tried to skip a state, skip Iowa and go straight to New Hampshire, skip New Hampshire and so to South Carolina --

WALLACE: Rudy Giuliani wanted to skip them all and go to Florida. That doesn't work out so well.

ELLEITHEE: Right, it just doesn't -- it doesn't work out so well.

But I think what Bloomberg is hoping here is that he can position himself to be sort of the moderate's last line of defense against the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders wing of the party. That if Biden stumbles and is falling behind --

WALLACE: And right now he's in fourth place in Iowa and -- and not leading in New Hampshire either.

ELLEITHEE: And that whoever sort of stumbles out of those early states is going to be spent in terms of resources and organization. And those later states, to his credit, are sort of more air war states than they are ground game states. He's got the money to invest heavily in advertising, that he can be the guy who can sort of be the moderates' last line of defense. I think -- I'm a little skeptical that it works, but it is a strategy that, you know, that if Biden stumbles, it looks like he's going to, you know, try to put himself in position to execute.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the possibility that Michael Bloomberg will get into this race, we got this on Facebook from Brad Yates. He writes, how does Bloomberg's stance on corporations stand against the current Democrat party's push toward socialism?

Congressman Edwards, how do you answer Brad basically on the -- on the question, is he just way too far to the right for this current Democratic Party?

EDWARDS: Well, I think that -- I mean I think that's a reasonable question but, look, there's no push toward socialism in the Democratic Party. But I do think that there is an understandable concern about income inequality and the -- a Michael Bloomberg candidacy actually puts that front and center. And the question of, are we going to allow 749 billionaires to control all of the wealth of 60 percent, the bottom 60 percent of Americans? And I think that's a legitimate debate for Democrats to have. We've been having that in our -- within our party.

WALLACE: How about the argument that billionaires like Bill Gates, like Michael Bloomberg, create enormous wealth and tremendous job opportunity and that that's actually what kind of feeds the bulldog?

EDWARDS: Absolutely they do and I worked for a corporation early in my career and I think that that is important.

But the question is, how do you pay your fair share to make certain that other Americans can aspire to their highest dreams too? Creating that wealth but also creating other opportunities for other Americans. I think that is a front and center debate of the Democratic Party and I think Michael Bloomberg's candidacy puts it right there in the middle.

And, you know, I'm looking forward to the debate because I think we've been engaged in this conversation for a long time and it's going to be important for any Democrat who wins in the Democratic primary to be able to unite the party. And I'm really not sure that a Michael Bloomberg is a candidate that can come and unite all of the factions of the Democratic Party.

WALLACE: All right, let's turn to the elections that were held this last Tuesday night, which were very interesting, where Democrats took control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in a quarter century and also it appears, although the Republican governor of Kentucky still won't concede, it appears that the Democrats have won the governor's seat in Kentucky.

President Trump talked in Kentucky, campaigning for the Republican governor the night before. Here's what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: You've got to vote, because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: So, Karl, how worried should the president and Republicans be, not so much about those specific results and those specific races, but what you saw and you saw it in 2018 and you saw it again here, the suburbs. The suburbs in Virginia. The suburbs in Kentucky. The suburbs in Pennsylvania, around Philadelphia, this continuing move away from a Republican Party to the Democrats?

ROVE: Yes, and, look, all suburbs are not the same. You mentioned Kentucky. In Kentucky you had a very --

WALLACE: You brought your whiteboard?

ROVE: I brought the whiteboard for the first time appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”

In the governor's race, the Republican got 48.8 percent of the vote. Right below him on the ballot is a fresh first-time candidate, African-American Republican candidate for attorney general, who gets 57.8 percent of the vote and 75,000 votes ahead of the guy above him on the ballot, runs nine points ahead of him. The rest of the ticket for agriculture commissioner, auditor, secretary of state and treasurer --

WALLACE: My goodness, this is Kentucky. It's a pretty red state.

ROVE: I understand. I understand. But the point is, is that in the suburbs, those candidates run 11 to 12 points ahead of the Republican candidate for governor and for the first time in the modern era the Republicans take all those down ballot offices, which says, if you've got good candidates who make an appeal, they can carry the Republican suburbs.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: But, warning, negative, southeast Pennsylvania, Montgomery Bucks (ph), Delaware and Chester, Republican strongholds. The Democrats took Delaware County for the first time. The county council is 5-0 Democrat. First time they've had a majority on the county council since the civil war.

And then in Virginia, we've known about northern Virginia fading away from the Republicans. In this election it was the Richmond suburbs of Henrico (ph) and Chesterfields (ph). The Republicans have got a problem in the suburbs and Kentucky says if you right -- run the right kind of campaign and have the right kind of Democrat, you can win. But (INAUDIBLE) a problem.

WALLACE: I want to -- I want to bring Josh in.

There's the continuing fallout from Elizabeth Warren's continuing plans, spending, taxing trillions of dollars. And there was blowback this week from two relatively surprising sources. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: When you say I should pay a hundred billion, OK, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over.

JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: I don't like vilifying anybody. I -- you know, I think we should applaud successful people.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Josh, Bill Gates and Jamie Dimon, who's the CEO of JP Morgan, are certainly rich, but they are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination. What does that say to you? I mean, obviously, they're two billionaires who are -- I guess Dimon's not a billionaire, but two rich guys. What does that say to you about their problems that Elizabeth Warren will have with her tax and spend policies in a general election?

HOLMES: I think the best sign that Elizabeth Warren has a real problem with sort of your center left Democratic constituency is the fact that we started this segment talking about Michael Bloomberg. I mean Michael Bloomberg said back in February that as long as Joe Biden is in this race and feels like he's got a comfortable hold on the nomination, he's not interested in running. But if the Democratic Party looks like it's auguring towards nominating somebody who's in that sort of left wing, sort of more extreme category --

WALLACE: But we should point out Michael Bloomberg's another billionaire.

HOLMES: Sure. Absolutely.

But here's the -- here's the point. The point is, is that Joe -- this all says a lot more about Joe Biden then it says about anything else. Joe Biden is now in a place where he has lost his hold on the Democratic primary electorate and the Democratic primary electorate is looking for an Elizabeth Warren. That's what -- you know, with all due respect to Bill Gates --

WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) Elizabeth Warren or --

HOLMES: No, no, with all -- with all due respect to Bill Gates and all the other billionaires who have critiques about where the Democratic Party is, the Democratic primary electorate is saying loud and clear for anybody who will listen, we like Elizabeth Warren. We like Bernie Sanders. We have had five or six candidates try the center rode here and we have run them out of town in this -- in this primary electorate.

ELLEITHEE: You've got Biden and Buttigieg --

EDWARDS: Joe Biden --

ELLEITHEE: Are -- are doing about as well combined as Warren and Sanders are doing combined.

HOLMES: Well, he's -- look, he's lost --

ROVE: One's at seven and one's at 20.

ELLEITHEE: The moderates --

ROVE: And the other two are at 18 and 22.

ELLEITHEE: Not in Iowa. In Iowa those four are clustered very closely together.

Look, in 2018, more center left Democrats won congressional primaries than far left Democrats won congressional primaries with a primary (INAUDIBLE).

HOLMES: But it's not happening in the 2020 cycle. And I've got to tell you, people --

ROVE: There's a lot more far left Democrats won primaries in 2020 than won in 2018 or 2016.

ELLEITHEE: We'll see.

EDWARDS: This hasn't shaken out yet, so -- I mean it hasn't shaken out at all and everything's still (INAUDIBLE).

WALLACE: So the battle continues. Thank you all, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" the dedication it takes to escort the nation's bravest to their final resting place.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: On this Veterans Day weekend, we want to introduce you to a special military unit whose mission is to pay final tribute to the men and women who have defended our freedom. Here is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CAPTAIN ZACKARY STEELMAN, U.S. ARMY OLD GUARD CAISSON PLATOON: It's our honor to be able to provide them the best ceremony that they deserve and that their families deserve, to just pay it back to them the way that they've paid it to us.

WALLACE: Captain Zackary Steelman is talking about the Old Guard Caisson Platoon that bears the casket for military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery.

Two teams go out, one with white horses, one with black. Each participating in as many as four funerals a day. But the platoon is determined every one will be special.

STEELMAN: That family isn't going to get a second funeral. We have to put as much effort and time into making sure every detail of what we do is the best we can make it.

Do what you've got to do.

WALLACE: A squad is up at 4:30 each morning to make sure it's perfect. The horses are sprayed till they glean. The tack is shined. And so is the caisson that carried a canon back in the First World War.

Then, the horses are hitched up. The lead team that takes the caisson through the cemetery, the swing team that gets around tight corners, and the wheel team that acts as breaks. Then, they call out the mission.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Attention to orders! Zero nine, grant (ph) the 12 alpha, colonel, United States Air Force.

Swing?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lead?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wheel?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Caisson forward! Out (ph)!

WALLACE (on camera): Why do you have to do all of that?

STEELMAN: Well, it's not that we have to do any of those things, sir, it's really that we get to do those things. We're about to perform a funeral and we're about to perform the mission for that family and we want to make sure that we're doing it to the absolute best ability that we have for them.

WALLACE (voice over): The caisson platoon is part of presidential funerals. A riderless horse named Black Jack was in John Kennedy's procession. When he stepped on his handlers toe, the soldier kept marching.

In 2004, the military honors were for Ronald Reagan. The riderless horse was named Sergeant York, he is still part of the platoon.

STEELMAN: Sergeant York is the oldest horse that we have here in the barn. He's actually 29.

WALLACE (on camera): Twenty-nine?

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: Reagan used to say that there's nothing as good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse.

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: He would have loved this one.

WALLACE (voice over): Captain Steelman signed up for the Army's armor branch. When he joined the caisson platoon, he had never been on a horse. Now he thinks it's as important as any other mission.

WALLACE (on camera): How long do you want to keep being in the caisson platoon.

STEELMAN: If I could, sir, I'd be here for the rest of my life. I absolutely love this job.

I get to see soldiers every single day put in a lot of hard work for someone they really don't even know. I'm honored to be able to bring them to their final resting place. And it's just an honor to be a part of that specific mission.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Horses in the caisson platoon are put up for adoption after the service is complete. And right now Elvira, a member of the swing team for 16 years, is available. If you want to find out more, please go to our website, foxnewssunday.com.

And before we go, here's a live look at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Our colleagues at Fox NFL Sunday there for a special Veterans Day broadcast as a salute to the troops.

And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

The GOP witness list, obtained by Fox News earlier Saturday, included Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president Joe Biden, and the anonymous intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky triggered the impeachment inquiry.

""The committee ... will not facilitate efforts by President Trump and his allies in Congress to threaten, intimidate and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm,"" Schiff said in a letter to Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif. "" ... The whistleblower has a right under laws championed by this committee to remain anonymous and to be protected from harm.""

REPUBLICANS WANT HUNTER BIDEN, UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER AS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITNESSES

""The impeachment inquiry, moreover, has gathered an ever-growing body of evidence -- from witnesses and documents, including the president's own words in his July 25 call record -- that not only confirms but far exceeds the initial information in the whistleblower's complaint ... "" Schiff concluded his letter. ""In light of the president's threats, the individual's appearance before us would only place their personal safety at grave risk.""

Earlier in his letter, Schiff had warned Nunes that the impeachment inquiry and the House Intelligence Committee ""will not serve as vehicles"" for what he called ""sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit.""

The impeachment inquiry began when a whistleblower reported that Trump had pushed Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine— specifically, why former Vice President Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter held a lucrative role on the board, bringing in a reported $50,000 per month.

Republicans noted that testimony from former State Department official George Kent raised concerns about ""the appearance of a conflict of interest stemming from Mr. Biden's position on Burisma's board,"" and added that former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich was prepared by the Obama State Department to address questions about Mr. Biden's position on Burisma during her Senate confirmation process.

Republicans also planned to call the younger Biden's former long-time business partner, Devon Archer, who also sat on the board of Burisma. Republicans claim Archer can help the public to understand ""the nature and extent of Ukraine's pervasive corruption information that bears directly on President Trump's longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country.""

Schiff himself said in September the whistleblower would appear before Congress “very soon,” but in recent weeks has suggested that testimony is unnecessary.

""Because President Trump should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers, the anonymous whistleblower should testify,"" Nunes wrote in his letter to Schiff earlier Saturday. ""Moreover, given the multiple discrepancies between the whistleblower's complaint and the closed-door testimony of the witnesses, it is imperative that the American people hear definitively how the whistleblower developed his or her information, and who else the whistleblower may have fed the information he or she gathered and how that treatment of classified information may have led to the false narrative being perpetrated by the Democrats during this process.""

Republicans are also requesting that the ""more than half a dozen sources"" the whistleblower cited in their complaint to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, whose identities also remain anonymous, attend for a public deposition.

The list of witnesses also includes Nellie Ohr, a researcher at opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier; Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American consultant for the Democratic National Committee who allegedly met with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C. to discuss incriminating information about Trump campaign officials; ex-National Security Council official Tim Morrison; former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker; and high-ranking State Department official David Hale.

Earlier Saturday, the president again called the impeachment inquiry a “witch hunt” and said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Schiff and Biden should be added to the list of witnesses who would be called to testify.

""The witch hunt continues, lot of witch hunt continues,” he told reporters. ""The Republicans have never been so united and I think the people of our country have never been so united.”

Sens. Harris, D-Calif., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to Barr after The Washington Post reported that Trump made the request around Sept. 25, when the administration released a transcript of the call.

TRUMP PUSHES BACK ON REPORT BARR DENIED REQUEST FOR PRESS CONFERENCE CLEARING HIM ON UKRAINE

The outlet reported that Trump has told associates he wished Barr would have held the news conference, amid the escalating House impeachment probe surrounding the call. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Trump's desire for a public announcement from Barr was discussed among White House officials, who in turn relayed that desire to the Justice Department. However, the outlet reported that it couldn't be determined how hard Trump had pressed for a news conference -- or the reason for Barr's denial.

“These reports raise serious concerns about the president’s perception of the Justice Department as a partisan political instrument and his willingness to use the power of federal law enforcement in pursuit of his own objectives,” the senators wrote in the request.

“We submit this FOIA request in order to obtain communications, documents, and other information related to the president’s reported request that you hold a news conference to clear him of wrongdoing during his call with the Ukrainian president,” the request said.

House Democrats claim that the call, in which Trump urged Zelensky to “look into” allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and alleged Ukraine interference in the 2016 presidential election, was part of a quid pro quo involving the withholding of U.S. military aid that was temporarily blocked by the White House. Trump has denied a quid quo pro while the Ukrainians have said there was no pressure from the White House.

Trump has also pushed back on the reports.

“Bill Barr did not decline my request to talk about Ukraine,” he tweeted Thursday morning. “The story was a Fake Washington Post con job with an 'anonymous' source that doesn’t exist. Just read the Transcript. The Justice Department already ruled that the call was good. We don’t have freedom of the press!”

Trump then tweeted a more robust denial: ""The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference. Never happened, and there were no sources!"" This, after he tweeted earlier calling the story “totally untrue and just another FAKE NEWS story with anonymous sources that don’t exist.”

The request from the senators calls for all memos and correspondence involving Barr, Deputy Attorney General Jeffery Rosen or the immediate office of the attorney general since August 14 as well as phrases including “Ukraine,” “Zelensky,” “transcript,” “journalists” and “news conference.”

“If President Trump’s passionate assertion that such reports are ‘pure fiction’ and ‘Fake News’ is indeed correct, then the Department of Justice should have no problem in expeditiously processing our request,” the senators wrote.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., testify in a closed-door setting as part of the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

Fox News has obtained a letter written by committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who demanded that Schiff appear for a deposition in private before lawmakers.

""On November 6th, you announced the beginning of public hearings associated with the Democratic Party's partisan impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump,"" Nunes wrote Friday. ""Based on the precedent and lack of jurisdiction, the House Intelligence Committee should not take the lead in conducting such hearings; however, by now the American people know your desire to see the duly-elected president removed from office outweighs your sense of responsibility to running a functioning intelligence oversight committee.

""Prior to the start of your public show trial next week, at least one additional closed-door deposition must take place,"" he continued. ""Specifically, I request that you sit for a closed-door deposition before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees.""

Nunes went on to note that in August 2019, Schiff and his staff ""met with or talked to the whistleblower who raised an issue with President Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President [Volodymyr] Zelensky.""

""Although you publicly claim nothing inappropriate was discussed, the three committees deserve to hear directly from you the substance and circumstances surrounding any discussions conducted with the whistleblower, and any instructions you issued regarding those discussions,"" Nunes wrote. ""Given that you have reneged on your public commitment to let the committees interview the whistleblower directly, you are the only individual who can provide clarity as to these conversations.""

BOLTON LAWYER TEASES KNOWLEDGE ABOUT UKRAINE NOT YET MADE PUBLIC IN LETTER TO CONGRESS

He added: ""As you know, the House Intelligence Committee has precedent for such an arrangement. During the Committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, sitting Members of Congress agreed to participate in closed-door depositions. Given your championing of such an arrangement two years ago, you should have no problem with you appearing before the three committees to discuss your interactions with the whistleblower.""

Schiff maintains that he has not personally spoken with the anonymous whistleblower. However, it was revealed several weeks ago that the whistleblower had early contact with his office, essentially giving them a heads-up about the complaint concerning Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky.

Meanwhile, Republicans are expected to release a full list of proposed witnesses for testimony in a public setting in the coming days.

Nunes’ and Republicans’ effort to devise a strategy going forward comes after the House approved rules for the impeachment inquiry process last week. While Republicans opposed the resolution and complained the rules were unfair, Democrats still gave GOP lawmakers the ability to subpoena witnesses with the concurrence of Democratic committee chairs. If the chair does not consent, the minority can appeal to the full committee.

BOLTON WARNED OF 'HAND GRENADE' GIULIANI, SHUT DOWN UKRAINE MEETING, AIDE TOLD IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

This process still gives Democrats final say over witnesses. A GOP source told Fox News this week that it's unlikely Democrats would go along with the efforts to call Schiff -- who is essentially leading the impeachment probe.

The source told Fox News that Republicans want answers to questions like: “How many times did he [Schiff] meet with the whistleblower? What did they advise the whistleblower to do? How much was Schiff involved in this? Did he recommend the whistleblower give the complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, even though there was no intel component so that he could be involved?”

But GOP lawmakers for days had telegraphed that they were interested in making the attempt.

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that Schiff is the ""first person"" who should be brought in, along with his staff.

Last week, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., publicly challenged Schiff to come before the judiciary panel.

“Come to the Judiciary Committee,"" Collins said after the passage of the impeachment rules resolution. ""Be the first witness and take every question asked of you. Starting with your own involvement [with] the whistleblower.”

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FLAGGED HUNTER BIDEN'S 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST' IN UKRAINE, TESTIMONY SHOWS

Schiff’s office last month said that the whistleblower had reached out to them before filing the complaint in mid-August, giving Democrats advance warning of the accusations that would lead them to launch the inquiry days later. The inspector general's complaint about Trump’s phone call with Zelensky flagged concerns about efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.

A transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his congressional allies deny, and plan to continue to deny, that military aid was clearly linked to the request, or that there was any ""quid pro quo."" Some witnesses who have appeared before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.

Meanwhile, Republicans are also hoping to call the whistleblower to testify, according to the source, who pointed to Schiff’s recent reversal on the issue.

Schiff in September had promised testimony from the whistleblower “very soon."" But in recent weeks has suggested that testimony is unnecessary.

Meanwhile, Schiff announced Wednesday that his committee would hold the first open hearings of the impeachment inquiry next week, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.

“On Wednesday, November 13, 2019, we will hear from [U.S. charge d'affaires for Ukraine] William Taylor and [diplomat] George Kent,” Schiff announced. “On Friday, November 15, 2019, we will hear from [former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine] Marie Yovanovitch."

Ezra Klein wrote at the time that the list showed the Republican-led House was no longer “a sane place.” Ezra added, “The House GOP’s debt limit bill … isn’t a serious governing document. It’s not even a plausible opening bid. It’s a cry for help.”

Six years later, Republican leaders have some ideas about the witnesses who should testify in the House impeachment inquiry as it advances to its next phase, which includes public hearings that begin this week. But reading the GOP’s witness list, it doesn’t strike me as a plausible opening bid – it seems more like a cry for help. The Washington Post reported over the weekend:

House Republicans on Saturday pressed ahead with their efforts to move the impeachment inquiry away from President Trump, calling on Democrats to add witnesses to the probe including former vice president Joe Biden’s son and the whistleblower whose initial complaint kicked off the investigation. […] The sprawling list of potential witnesses named by Republicans on Saturday … included Hunter Biden, whose father is a leading Democratic candidate to challenge Trump in 2020; Hunter Biden’s business partner Devon Archer; the unnamed whistleblower, who Trump and some of his allies have campaigned to publicly identify; the researcher Nellie Ohr of Fusion GPS, which commissioned a dossier linking Russia and Trump; and Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American who worked with the Democratic National Committee.

This is not a list compiled by officials who are serious about the inquiry.

Of course, as a procedural matter, House Republicans, from their minority perch, can’t simply call whatever witnesses they want. Rather, their wish list was turned over to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who soon after explained that the impeachment probe would not serve “to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference” that Trump asked Ukraine to conduct.

Or put another way, the Republicans’ requested witness list probably won’t be taken too seriously by the House majority. The interesting thing is to consider what happens after the document ends up in the circular file in Schiff’s office.

It’s not hard to imagine how the dominoes are likely to fall. Schiff will dismiss the House GOP’s witness list as ridiculous, at which point Republicans will (again) denounce the impeachment inquiry as unfair. They’ve already made these claims, of course, and they’ve been discredited, but the complaints have never been conveyed as an accurate point rooted in good faith. The GOP’s audience has been the electorate at large, which Republicans hope to sway through dubious process claims.

But that’s not the only intended audience. I also wonder whether Senate Republicans, who’d be responsible for holding the impeachment “trial” in the event the House approves articles, might use something like this as an excuse to short-circuit the proceedings.

Indeed, by some measure, it’s already begun. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), doing lasting harm to what’s left of his reputation, told Fox News yesterday the impeachment inquiry would be “invalid” unless the intelligence community’s whistleblower is exposed.

That’s bonkers, but it’s where the debate appears to be headed."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): “You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?”

In a new interview with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, made a related argument:

“I think the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why [do] we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?”

Those familiar with American Civics 101 probably realize the reason “a bunch of people in Congress” are working on an impeachment inquiry is because that’s how the process is supposed to work under the U.S. Constitution. What’s more, we have “a bunch of people in Congress” grappling with how to address presidential abuses because “the American people” decided to put the House of Representatives in the hands of a Democratic majority – made up of members who ran on a platform of holding Trump accountable.

I’m going to assume that Haley, a former top member of Donald Trump’s team, knows all of this. I’ll also assume that the point she intended to make was about delaying judgment on the president’s apparent misconduct until Election Day 2020. Indeed, the former South Carolina governor added on Twitter over the weekend, “This is a decision for the American people.”

It’s an increasingly popular pitch in GOP circles. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who’ll retire from elected office next year, recently argued, “An election, which is just around the corner, is the right way to decide who should be president.” Similarly, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, added yesterday, “Let the American people decide this in less than a year.”

At face value, this may seem like one of the GOP’s less ridiculous arguments. Trump was caught crossing the line, and if voters have a problem with the president’s abuses, they can vote for someone new next November. If, on the other hand, voters are unmoved, the electorate can make that clear, too.

There are, however, a couple of serious flaws with this.

NBC News’ First Read team published an item in September about the Ukraine scandal, just as it was starting to break, that stuck with me:

If this is what this looks like … then it’s arguably worse than Watergate, when the dirty tricks were being conducted by Americans against Americans. But this time, is the dirty trick a sitting president dangling aid to a foreign country to get it to investigate a rival campaign? We learned from 2016 that the Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. Do national Democrats – who believe defeating Trump in 2020, not impeaching him, is the best way to remove him from office – understand what else we might see over the next 14 months?

The Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. That, in a nutshell, is why the scandal can’t wait. One of the key pillars of the whole controversy has been a simple fact: Trump intended to cheat in the election by way of an extortion scheme. The president, rightly or wrongly, saw Joe Biden as a credible electoral threat, which led him to push a vulnerable foreign ally to cook up some dirt Republicans could use before Election Day.

To let this go unpunished is to effectively encourage the president who knows no limits, and believes there can be no checks on his misconduct, to keep exploring other cheating options.

The broader national goal should be to ensure that the United States has a free and fair election next year. Trump has already taken steps that are fundamentally at odds with that goal.

It’s not as if the president has rolled out some kind of “mea culpa” defense, acknowledging poor judgment, and assuring the public that he intends to stop trying to screw around with the 2020 cycle. On the contrary, Trump has done largely the opposite, insisting his actions were “perfect,” permissible, and literally unimpeachable.

As New York’s Jon Chait recently put it, “Using his foreign-policy authority to leverage dirt on Americans who oppose him is not a mistake, it is Trump’s ongoing campaign strategy. Either he will be removed from office over it, or he will use that strategy to try to win reelection.”

To ask “the American people” to decide the proper resolution is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months. Trump has already made it painfully obvious that he has a very different plan in mind."

According to an unsigned memo circulated internally among Trump campaign staff and exclusively obtained by Fox News, the Trump campaign argued that last week’s election results — specifically in Kentucky — were actually a “clear rejection of the brand of radical extremism that Democrats are espousing and that Joe Biden has embraced again and again on the campaign trail.”

“If [former Vice President Joe] Biden thinks he will be able to hide from his record — and his recent conversions to current Democrat dogma — he’s in over his head as the pundits think he is,” the memo read. “Joe Biden’s campaign has proven that there is no centrist lane in the Democrat presidential race.”

The Trump campaign’s memo rejected the notion that the Biden campaign would be able to win Southern states in the general election in 2020 -- should Biden ultimately become the Democratic presidential nominee.

“Biden has shifted to the radical left on every issue concerning swing voters,” the Trump campaign memo read, referring back to a statement Biden made on the campaign trail earlier this year.

JOE BIDEN PREDICTS REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE AN 'EPIPHANY' ONCE TRUMP LEAVES OFFICE

“I plan on, if I’m your nominee, winning Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, believe it or not,’” they quoted Biden as saying.

“We see no evidence to support this fantasy,” the campaign added.

The Biden campaign shot back in a statement to Fox News.

""When Donald Trump campaigned for Matt Bevin in a commonwealth he won by almost 30 points, he warned, 'They’re going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. ...You can’t let that happen to me.' Well, Kentucky made that happen,"" Biden campaign rapid response director Andrew Bates said. ""Bevin lost. Trump lost. The same outcome took place in Virginia and in 2018 when health care cost Republicans the House.""

Bates continued: ""This will continue as long as Donald Trump is still trying to take health coverage away from millions and end the ACA's life-saving protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. And Trump is so terrified of being called out for this moral failure that he tried to extort a foreign country into lying for him.""

""No one buys his MAGA-dreamland excuses,"" he said.

The Trump campaign memo appears to be a direct rebuttal to a Biden campaign internal memo, which was first reported by NBC News last week and obtained by Fox News on Monday. The Biden campaign’s memo touted the off-cycle wins and strategies in swing states as “the right formula with which Democrats can retake the White House from Donald Trump.”

The Biden campaign’s memo touted Virginia Democrats’ victory in capturing both chambers of the state legislature after the former vice president held a get-out-the-vote rally with former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

“And if this model succeeds in states as challenging for Democrats as Kentucky, it can absolutely gain us the necessary ground to re-take more competitive battleground states, and that is exactly what Joe Biden — more so than any other Democrat running –is poised to do,” it said.

The dueling memos were outlining two starkly different campaigns’ views on Democrats’ election victories in Kentucky and Virginia last week.

In Virginia, Democrats flipped both the state Senate and the House of Delegates, giving them control of both the governor’s office and the legislature for the first time in more than two decades.

Meanwhile, in Kentucky, Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin trailed Democratic rival Andy Beshear, who served as the state’s attorney general. Bevin has not yet conceded in the race, but Democrats have declared victory. Bevin argued that there were “significant irregularities” in the race, and called for a recanvassing, after results showed him approximately 5,000 votes behind Beshear. That recanvass will take place Thursday.

Nevertheless, the Biden campaign touted Beshear’s lead, noting in the memo that Democrats used the issue of health care to help them win.

“In Kentucky, a state Trump won by nearly 30 points, Andy Beshear outmaneuvered incumbent Republican Governor Matt Bevin, by calling-out Bevin’s undermining of the Commonwealth's Medicaid expansion that has gained thousands healthcare coverage and holding him accountable for the divisions he stoked as chief executive there,” the Biden memo read.

The Trump campaign, though, has instead painted Beshear as a “Trump-friendly moderate,” saying he distanced himself from impeachment “and took great pains to reach out to Trump-supporting conservatives in coal country and other parts of rural Kentucky.”

“[Beshear’s] campaign went so far as to run an ad with Trump voters: ‘I’m still a Donald Trump guy,’ one voter tells the camera. ‘Trump, 100 percent,’ says another,” the memo read.

“In contrast, Joe Biden has loudly called for President Trump’s impeachment and, like the rest of the 2020 Democrats, made it a centerpiece of his campaign,” the Trump campaign added. “He has slandered Trump voters like those featured in Beshear's ad as racists, embraced the job-killing Green New Deal, pledged to ‘shut down’ coal plants and end all fossil fuel development, ridiculed middle-class tax cuts, endorsed taxpayer-funded abortion, and close down detention facilities for illegal immigrants.”

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN LEADS NOMINATION RACE, TOPS TRUMP BY 12 POINTS IN MATCHUP

They added: “This is the ‘template’ Joe Biden is planning to run on in 2020 – and it won’t sell in Kentucky or elsewhere.”

The Trump campaign’s memo also touted other Republican victories in Kentucky, such as Daniel Cameron as the first African-American to be elected to be Kentucky’s attorney general. Further, Cameron will be the first Republican attorney general in the state in more than 70 years.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also touted Republican wins last week and said it signaled enthusiasm for Trump in 2020.

“While the mainstream media will continue to extrapolate an incoming blue wave based solely on one outlier race in Kentucky, the fact remains: this was a historic night of victories for Republicans and a great indication of what’s to come in 2020,” she wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. “Enthusiasm for President Trump and his policies continues to grow, and in less than one year we will once again witness a historic victory as President Trump is reelected and Republicans win up and down the ballot.”

Meanwhile, the latest Fox News poll reveals that in a head-to-head match-up, Biden leads Trump by 12 points with 51 percent of the vote over Trump’s 39 percent. In October, Biden led that same poll by 10 percent.

Parnas' lawyer confirmed to Fox News that his client told Ukrainian officials that Vice President Mike Pence would not attend the swearing-in of the new president and the United States would freeze aid to the Eastern European nation if the demands were not met.

The claim by Parnas, who has been preparing to testify in the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry into President Trump, directly challenged the accounts by Trump and Ukrainian officials that have been at the heart of the congressional probe. Parnas’ claim also directly tied Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, to threats of retribution if Ukrainian officials did not comply with the demands – something Giuliani steadfastly has denied.

BUSINESSMEN PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO CONSPIRING WITH GIULIANI ASSOCIATES

Parnas’ story, however, has been contradicted by a number of people, including his business partner Igor Fruman, who also was present at a meeting with the Ukrainians and claimed neither the issue of foreign aid nor the vice president’s attendance at the inauguration was raised.

Both Parnas and Fruman pleaded not guilty two weeks ago to campaign-finance charges connected to political donations to a pro-Trump super PAC. They were accused of using a limited liability company, Global Energy Producers (GEP), to make donations in American elections to advance the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official.

Giuliani had hired Parnas and Furman to try persuading Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son Hunter for possible corruption. That relationship has now become another arm of the growing impeachment inquiry against Trump, as three House committees have been looking into whether Trump tried to persuade Zelensky to investigate the Bidens by withholding U.S. military aid during a July 25 phone call between the two leaders.

The first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry are scheduled to be held this Wednesday and Friday, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.

The first public hearing is to feature Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who already testified behind closed doors to congressional investigators that the president pushed Ukraine to investigate election interference, Biden and his son and their Ukraine dealings.

George Kent, the deputy assistant Secretary of State, is also scheduled to appear with Taylor. Kent testified behind closed doors last month; he told the committees he had concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian natural-gas firm Burisma Holdings in 2015 but was rebuffed by the former vice president’s staff, which said the office was preoccupied with Beau Biden’s cancer battle."

“Show him that tape and tell me there’s not something to investigate ... Swalwell is totally off the cracker with this one. His cheese has fallen to the floor.""

SWALWELL SAYS EVIDENCE IN IMPEACHMENT DEPOSITIONS AMOUNTS TO 'EXTORTION SCHEME' BY TRUMP ADMIN

Swalwell lambasted Republican calls for Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, to come before the House and testify during the public Trump impeachment inquiry hearings, saying, ""We’re not going to go back in time and revisit conspiracy theories that were implicated in the president’s call.”

Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky during his July 25 phone call to investigate Biden family dealings in Ukraine. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev.

Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.

WHY BIDEN EXCELS NATIONALLY, STRUGGLES IN EARLY STATES

Politico: “Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic race for president. Or he’s faltering, slipping into fourth place as he loses ground to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and an ascendant Pete Buttigieg. Those alternate realities are playing out in real time — reflected in Biden’s solid standing atop national polls versus his middling performance in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys on the other. The disparity is at once a source of frustration to Biden’s team and one of hope to rivals holding out for an utter collapse by the former vice president in the two earliest nominating states. The explanations for the discrepancy run the gamut. The white Iowa and New Hampshire electorates play against Biden’s strength among ideological moderates and African Americans, some defenders argue. Skeptics say it shows that the voters watching him most closely are underwhelmed. There's the fact that Biden pulled back on early state ad spending — both on TV and digitally — while competitors ramped up. Finally, the Trump factor: The president's reelection campaign has been running anti-Biden ads on TV in Iowa and more broadly over social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.”



Biden super PAC issues memo warning in early states - Politico: “A super PAC supporting Joe Biden warned Saturday that the Trump campaign is seeking to take down the former vice president in early state contests with a barrage of negative ads. ‘Trump is spending considerable sums in the early states, particularly Iowa, in a hope to stop Biden’s momentum before he can get to the states where his coalition works to his benefit,’ Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote in a memo obtained by POLITICO. … The memo from Unite the Country super PAC … lays out the candidate's consistent strength in national Democratic primary polls and in matchups with President Donald Trump in battleground states. It also points to Biden’s steady lead in South Carolina and Nevada, the latter two of the four early nominating state, which have a far more diverse electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire. Wins there would give Biden momentum heading into the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, the memo states.”



Klobuchar says a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make debate stage - Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn’t spare any punches on Sunday when going after fellow 2020 presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg – saying that a woman with the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s experience would not be on the debate stage. Klobcuhar, who has been polling in the middle of the still-crowded field of Democrats, argued during an appearance on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ that while every candidate in her party has been more qualified to lead the country than President Trump, she doubted a woman with the same resume as Buttigieg would be given a chance at running for president. ‘Of the women on the stage, I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sens. Harris and Warren and myself. Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,’ Klobuchar said in reference to Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.”



#YangGang: Now what? - NYT: “Enthusiasm for Mr. [Andrew] Yang is probably most palpable here in New Hampshire where the entrepreneur has repeatedly polled around 5 percent, his strongest showing in an early-voting state. … All of which leaves Mr. Yang and his senior campaign staff — some of whom, before this, had never run a campaign of any kind — with a new quandary: What do we do now? … But moving forward, Mr. Yang said he wants his message to become ‘more human-based’ — perhaps a necessary shift for a candidate seeking a broader audience who has thus far focused much of his attention on robots. His vision of a ‘human-based’ campaign, he said, involves talking more about the way he thinks his signature pitch can really change lives. … The strategic pivot — the most significant in the campaign to date — is most clearly exemplified by the new television ad Mr. Yang’s team put on the air Thursday in Iowa. They spent more than $1 million on the ad buy, the kind of seven-figure sum they did not have available to them for the long first few phases of his run.”



New venue chosen for December Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic presidential debate in December has been moved to Loyola Marymount University, after controversy over a labor fight upended plans to host the prime-time event at the University of California, Los Angeles. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour, the sponsors of the Dec. 19 debate, announced the change after the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that UCLA would no longer serve as the venue because of an ongoing dispute between the school and its largest employee union. … Six Democratic White House contenders have so far qualified to appear on stage: Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.”

“But all extremes are pernicious in various ways.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 35



TIME OUT: THE HISTORY OF VETERANS DAY

NYT: “On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect. ‘King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,’ The New York Times wrote in a front-page headline on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, the paper reported that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country. In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted the monumental changes that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. … In 1954, in response to calls for recognition of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978.”

REP. PETER KING ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

Fox News: “Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., the powerful 14-term congressman who once chaired the House Committee on Homeland Security, announced Monday he will not seek reelection in 2020. King, in a statement Monday, said his ‘prime reason’ for retiring ‘was that after 28 years of spending four days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford.’ ‘This was not an easy decision. But there is a season for everything and Rosemary and I decided that, especially since we are both in good health, it is time to have the flexibility to spend more time with our children and grandchildren,’ he said. … The 75-year-old congressman said his decades in Congress have been ‘an extraordinary experience.’ He currently serves as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, which he served as chair from 2005-2006 and again from 2011-2012… King is one of several Republicans — four senators and 17 other House members — who have announced plans to not seek reelection.”



Sessions’ feels support from 11 GOP senators in open letter - Politico: “Nearly a dozen of Jeff Sessions' former GOP Senate colleagues are backing his run for Senate, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. In an ‘open letter to conservatives’ on Sessions' candidacy for Alabama's Senate race next year, 11 Republican senators say that Sessions is a ‘man of his word. And we know he is devoted to serving the people of Alabama.’ … The letter is signed by GOP Sens. Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, John Boozman of Arkansas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Roberts, Enzi and Isakson are all retiring this year or next. Barrasso and Blunt are the Nos. 3 and 4 GOP leaders, respectively, in the Senate GOP.”



Steve Knight eyes old seat after Katie Hill resignation - Fox News: “The two-term Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Katie Hill announced on his website Sunday that he will attempt to win back his old seat. ‘I am proud to return to public service and deliver the type of representation our district deserves,’ Steve Knight posted on his website. Hill defeated Knight by 9 points in California’s 25th District in November. Hill-- a centrist-- was seen as a rising Democratic star because the district is seen as one of a few in the state that could be carried by a Republican. Henry Olsen, a columnist in the Washington Post, wrote a piece last month that questioned whether or not the state was ‘reopening’ the doors to Republicans. He pointed out that the district was a Republican stronghold before President Trump. He also called the election—which will likely occur on March 3, a possible bellwether for Republicans.”



Kentucky Republicans losing patience with Gov. Bevin - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “Republican Senate President Robert Stivers believes Gov. Matt Bevin should concede his loss to Democrat Andy Beshear if next week's recanvas doesn't significantly change the vote totals. ‘It’s time to call it quits and go home, say he had a good four years and congratulate Gov.-elect Beshear,’ Stivers said in a brief Friday interview at the Capitol. Bevin finished 5,189 votes behind Beshear in Tuesday's gubernatorial election but has refused to concede the race, requesting a recanvas of the vote that will take place Nov. 14. … Stivers said if Bevin chooses to contest the election by calling a special session of the General Assembly and making a case that there was illegal activity, lawmakers would have to hear the dispute under the state constitution.”



The political deadlock in states for 2020 - NYT: “Acrimonious deadlocks have become the new normal in Wisconsin, one of three Midwestern states where Democrats ended full Republican control last year by flipping governorships. Gov. Tony Evers’s defeat of Scott Walker, whose success at pushing Wisconsin sharply to the right prompted a brief presidential bid, has given Democrats a new foothold this year in a region where they had been mostly sidelined. Yet with attention turning to the presidential election, in which Wisconsin voters are seen as playing a decisive role, divided power has given way to frustrated impasse, with little chance for either party to hold up state policymaking as the showcase it once was here. … In Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, Democrats’ victories last November came after a period of extraordinary, sustained Republican success. Going into the 2018 election, Republicans controlled the governor’s offices and the full legislatures in 10 of 12 Midwestern states. … Though the purpling of Midwestern statehouses since last November has served as a check on Republican power, it has hardly led to a bonanza of liberal legislating.”



HOUSE GOP PREPARES FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Politico: “House Republicans are gearing up for a blockbuster showdown with Democrats as the impeachment probe enters its most visible phase yet, with GOP lawmakers and staffers from key committees plotting with leadership to launch their counterattack. To prepare for this week’s public hearings, Republican leaders have moved one of President Donald Trump’s fiercest Hill defenders to the House Intelligence Committee and have lined up an explosive witness list for the upcoming proceedings, offering some clues into their defense strategy. The transcripts released last week from closed-door interviews with impeachment witnesses also provide a window into how the GOP plans to approach the high-stakes hearings. Republicans will try to paint the Democratically led process as politically motivated and minimize Trump's role in the quest to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. And they will also try to keep the heat off Trump by attacking the Bidens and pushing other conspiracy theories about the elections.”



Mulvaney makes last-minute move to join impeachment testimony lawsuit - WaPo: “White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that could determine whether senior administration officials testify in the impeachment inquiry was an unwelcome surprise to former top national security aides, highlighting internal divisions among President Trump’s advisers in the face of the probe. Former national security adviser John Bolton’s advisers and allies were taken aback to learn late Friday that Mulvaney had gone to court seeking to join a separation-of-powers lawsuit filed against Trump and the House leadership, according to people familiar with their views, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry. The suit was filed by Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House, The Washingon Post previously reported.”

Leaders like Pelosi and Hoyer may try to parse words about impeachment, but we’re well past the point of no return now. Impeachment is now the political equivalent of the Popeye’s chicken sandwich. Nothing commands as much attention.”

NOT SO GOLDEN SPONGE CAKE

KARE11: “Every school has its tradition. One of the most unique ones belongs to a school in Maine that has run an ongoing experiment for 43 years: How long can a Twinkie survive? The experiment at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Maine, started in 1976. During a lesson about food additives and preservatives, science teacher Roger Bennatti was asked by a student how long a Twinkie would last. Bennatti didn't know. So, of course, he tested it. … More than 43 years later, the Twinkie is still at the school… That golden cake has darkened and greyed and the spongy holes are more prevalent. But it's mostly kept it's shape. ‘The Twinkie has become much like me. It's older, it's grayer and it's more flaky,’ said Bennatti, who is now retired. … So how has it lasted this long? The obvious answer is preservatives. But even with that, a Hostess spokesperson told Reuters the modern-day Twinkie has a shelf life of 65 days.”

Republicans signaled their intent to focus on the younger Biden when they sought him as a hearing witness in a letter sent over the weekend. Democrats are unlikely to approve the request, but his conduct may be an unavoidable topic in this week's hearings, given that witnesses' closed-door testimony to date has made clear some in the prior administration held concerns about his role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings.

REPUBLICANS WANT HUNTER BIDEN, UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER AS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITNESSES

Even without Hunter Biden in the hearing room, Republicans will be eager to publicly pry into those concerns, if only to offer justification for the act at the heart of the impeachment inquiry: Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden's role, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden's connection to the firing of a prosecutor looking into the firm's founder.

""I think this is absolutely worth looking into,"" Republican Rep. Michael Waltz, of Florida, said Sunday on Fox News' ""America's News HQ,"" regarding the Hunter Biden controversy. ""Yet the mainstream media and the Democrats just want to say 'nothing to see here'.""

One of the first impeachment witnesses, State Department official George Kent, could be pressed by Republicans about Hunter Biden's work. He is one of two witnesses scheduled for the first day of public hearings Wednesday.

Republicans are likely to zero in on his prior closed-door testimony, where he discussed his concerns about Biden’s work with Burisma, but said he was told it wasn’t appropriate to discuss the matter because of the health struggles of former Vice President Joe Biden’s eldest son, Beau, who died of brain cancer.

According to a transcript of his Oct. 15 deposition released last week, Kent said that in January or February 2015, he “became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board” of Burisma Holdings while his father was overseeing Ukraine policy as vice president to former President Barack Obama.

“I did not know that at the time,” Kent testified. “And when I was on a call with somebody on the vice president’s staff and I cannot recall who it was, just briefing on what was happening into Ukraine, I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back, and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest.”

After discussing those concerns with Biden’s staff, Kent testified that “the message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time.”

Kent also told congressional investigators that he had repeatedly raised concerns with the Obama administration about Burisma, and also discussed the administration’s efforts to remove Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin from his post. At the time, Shokin was investigating Mykola Zlochevsky, the former minister of ecology and natural resources of Ukraine— also the founder of Burisma.

Shokin was fired in April 2016, and his case was closed by the prosecutor who replaced him, Yuriy Lutsenko (though Ukraine is now reviewing such cases). Biden once famously boasted on camera that when he was vice president and leading the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin.

Biden allies, though, maintain that his intervention had nothing to do with his son, but rather was tied to corruption concerns.

Shokin was widely accused of corruption on both sides of the Atlantic. Biden has said that the international community was supportive in pushing for his firing. The former vice president has repeatedly defended himself and his son, saying that neither of them did anything wrong when it came to work in Ukraine.

""My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,"" Biden said during a Democratic primary debate in October. ""I carried out the policy of the United States government, which was to root out corruption in Ukraine and that's what we should be focusing on.""

He added: “Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven they are flat-out lying.""

Hunter Biden has also defended his role, saying he did nothing improper, while acknowledging that it was ""poor judgment"" to have joined Burisma's board.

“I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,” the younger Biden said last month.

The Biden family actions in Ukraine, along with a separate issue connected to 2016 election interference, were at the core of what Trump wanted investigated out of Kiev. Trump's now-famous July phone call in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch the investigations prompted a whistleblower complaint and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TOLD CONGRESS HE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS IN 2015 BUT WAS IGNORED

The whistleblower’s complaint also stated their concerns that Trump was soliciting a foreign power to influence the 2020 presidential election — a concern that U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor directly testified to last month.

Taylor, during his closed-door deposition, testified that he “understood that the reason for investigating Burisma was to cast Vice President Biden in a bad light.” Taylor added that it would benefit “a political campaign for the reelection of President Trump.”

Taylor is expected to testify with Kent on Wednesday as part of the first round of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, in a letter penned by Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., Republicans have also proposed Hunter Biden’s former longtime business partner, Devon Archer, as a witness, claiming he could help to understand “the nature and extent of Ukraine’s pervasive corruption” which could provide “information that bears directly on President Trump’s longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country.”

But according to formal rules for the impeachment inquiry passed last month, Democrats have final say over witnesses.

Even outside the impeachment inquiry process, GOP lawmakers are amplifying concerns over the younger Biden’s business dealings. Last week, Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, taking issue with Biden and Archer’s roles on the board of Burisma.

“Emails recently obtained and made public through a FOIA request indicate that Burisma’s consulting firm used Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board to gain access and potentially influence matters at the State Department,” they wrote, further requesting State Department information related to Biden and Archer’s work.

They cited a 2016 email, first reported by Fox News contributor John Solomon, from a State Department official describing a request for a meeting from a Burisma representative -- the request name-dropped Hunter Biden.

“She noted that two high-profile U.S. citizens are affiliated with the company (including Hunter Biden as a board member),"" the email said, saying the representative wanted to get ""a better understanding of how the U.S. came to the determination that the company is corrupt"" while arguing there was no evidence of corruption.

Meanwhile, on Friday former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee in public. Yovanovich has previously told congressional investigators as part of the probe that former Vice President Biden never ""raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden"" with her."

FLASHBACK: UKRAINE EMBASSY SAYS DNC OPERATIVE REACHED OUT FOR INFORMATION ON TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN 2016

Watters said Republicans put forward a serious witness list for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. -- but doubted Schiff would allow many of those individuals to testify.

He commended lawmakers for mentioning the name of Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic National Committee (DNC) contractor whom a Ukrainian embassy official had claimed reached out for dirt on then-candidate Trump in 2016.

Earlier this year, Ambassador Valeriy Chaly said Chalupa pushed for Ukraine's then-President Petro Poroshenko to mention Paul Manafort's ties to Ukraine publicly during a visit to the U.S., and sought detailed financial information on his dealings in the country, The Hill reported. At the time, Manafort was President Trump's campaign chairman.

On ""The Five,"" Watters added that Hunter Biden was key to the impeachment effort on both sides of the argument, though Democrats including Schiff have resisted calls for him to testify.

""I love how Hunter Biden is 'irrelevant.' Hunter Biden is at the center of this whole Venn diagram -- You take Hunter Biden out of here, there is no story,"" he added.

""So, of course they'll rig it and they won't let him testify.""

The ""Watters World"" host said that Trump ultimately provided Ukraine with the defense aid before the Sept. 30 deadline, and that Kiev never opened an investigation into Biden or his father -- the former vice president and current 2020 presidential contender.

He also commented on Biden's tenuous position as the party's frontrunner and said other candidates have shifted too far to the left to be seen as viable options to defeat President Trump.

Trump commented on Bloomberg's possible candidacy and predicted that he will fail miserably if he attempts to enter the race. He also claimed there's no other candidate he would rather face than, ""little Michael.""

""He's not going to do well. But I think he's going to hurt Biden actually, but he doesn't have the magic to do well,"" Trump told reporters on Friday. ""Little Michael will fail.

""But I know Michael Bloomberg fairly well,"" he continued. ""He will not do very well, and if he did I'd be happy. There is nobody I'd rather run against than little Michael. That I can tell you.""

Republicans submitted a list of witnesses they would like to call, which is already creating controversy. Among those on the list is Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who was one of the subjects Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help investigate, as the younger Biden was a board member of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.

DEM LEADER TELLS GOP TO 'GET LOST' OVER IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITNESS LIST

“I would love to hear from Hunter Biden, I would love to hear from the other Americans who served on the board of Burisma,” House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, told “Fox News Sunday,” questioning how someone with no experience with Ukraine or natural gas would end up on the board of the company.

Ukrainian officials had been investigating Burisma while Joe Biden was vice president, only for the probe to end after the elder Biden pressured Ukraine into firing the prosecutor in charge. The reason for the firing has been a point of debate, and is a key part of the investigation Trump discussed with Zelensky.

Another committee member, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., appeared later in the program and dismissed the need for calling Hunter Biden to testify.

“He has no knowledge of what the president did or didn’t do here,” Maloney said. Trump’s request from Ukraine for assistance in investigating political rivals is at the center of the impeachment inquiry, after a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky inspired an anonymous whistleblower complaint.

Democrats have claimed the call was part of an attempted quid pro quo in exchange for withheld U.S. military aid and a White House meeting between Zelensky and Trump. Trump has denied the claim, saying the call was “perfect,” and Zelensky has said there was no pressure.

One thing that Hurd and Maloney agreed on was that the whistleblower should not be called to testify. Hurd spoke out against this, going against the members of his party who included the whistleblower on their list.

“I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistleblower; I’ve said that from the very beginning,” Hurd said, “because how we treat this whistleblower will impact whistleblowers in the future.”

Hurd did call for Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to answer questions about his office’s interactions with the whistleblower before Congress found out about the allegations contained in the complaint.

“He has misled the American public earlier in the year on what he knew about or the contact he had with the whistleblower, so if you want to protect the identity of the whistleblower, I think it’s important for Chairman Schiff to answer questions about his interactions.”

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Hakeem Jeffries rejected the GOP’s witness list on Twitter, telling them to “GET LOST,” but Maloney did not dismiss it outright.

BOLTON LAWYER TEASES KNOWLEDGE ABOUT UKRAINE NOT YET MADE PUBLIC IN LETTER TO CONGRESS

“I think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list,” he said, although the only ones he named were individuals who have already appeared in closed-door interviews, such as former U.S. Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and National Security Council official Tim Morrison.

One witness House Democrats called to testify was former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has been quoted as referring to a U.S. agreement with Ukraine regarding investigations as a “drug deal.” Bolton failed to appear, and his attorney Charles Cooper said Bolton would only appear if ordered by a judge, which would happen if Bolton is ordered to comply with a subpoena. So far, however, Democrats have not issued a subpoena for Bolton.

Cooper said in a letter to the top lawyer for the House of Representatives on Friday that Bolton and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, are seeking a ""definitive judgment from the Judicial Branch determining their constitutional duty in the face of conflicting demands"" from the White House and Congress.

Cooper’s letter said Bolton was involved in “many relevant meetings and conversations” to the impeachment inquiry.”

Maloney said “we sure do” want Bolton to appear, but would not say why Democrats would not subpoena him.

The revelation, which came in a transcript of Cooper's closed-door Oct. 23 deposition released Monday by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry, prompted concerns from commentators that the most self-destructive elements of the Russia probe were resurfacing.

""Like Russiagate, Ukrainegate enrolls liberals in the Cold War designs of dangerous hawks and neocons,"" tweeted journalist Aaron Mate.

Additionally, Cooper testified that the Trump administration had pushed Ukraine to issue a public statement disavowing any efforts to influence U.S. elections -- but Cooper stopped short of saying that officials wanted to include a reference to Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country.

Previous testimony in the inquiry has suggested that the White House improperly pressured Ukraine to implicate the Bidens publicly. Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, for example, had remarked that European Union envoy Gordon Sondland and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani worked with a top Ukrainian aide to include a reference to the Biden-linked Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.

But, Cooper said that on Aug. 20, Volker met with her -- and the idea of mentioning the Bidens apparently didn't come up.

""In that meeting, he did mention something to me that, you know, was the first about, somehow, an effort that he was engaged in to see if there was a statement that the government of Ukraine would make that would somehow disavow any interference in U.S. elections and would commit to the prosecution of any individuals involved in election interference,"" Cooper said. ""And, that was about as specific as it got.""

Cooper's testimony was made public as House Democrats on Monday also released transcripts from their interviews with Christopher Anderson, a career foreign service officer at the State Department, and Catherine Croft, a Ukraine expert at the State Department. Croft testified that she speculated Trump would be willing to shift Ukraine policy to hurt a Biden candidacy, and that news of a holdup of Ukraine aid ""blew up"" a State Department meeting.

Croft, in her remarks, said that the Office of Management and Budget had ""reported that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had placed an informal hold on security assistance to Ukraine. The only reason given was that it came at the direction of the president.""

Separately, Cooper testified about Defense Department concerns that Trump's temporary withholding of military aid to Ukraine may have been illegal.

""I'm not an expert on the law, but in that meeting immediately deputies began to raise concerns about how this could be done in a legal fashion because there was broad understanding in the meeting that the funding -- the State Department funding related to an earmark for Ukraine and that the DOD funding was specific to Ukraine security assistance,"" Cooper testified, concerning a July 23 meeting of national security officials. ""The comments in the room at the deputies' level reflected a sense that there was not an understanding of how this could legally play out, and at that meeting, the deputies agreed to look into the legalities and to look at what was possible.""

The legalities likely regarded the issue of ""impoundment"" – the requirement that the president either had to spend the money or ""impound"" it. The White House was coming up against an impoundment deadline when it released the funds for Ukraine.

Moreover, Cooper said, Defense Department officials were concerned that Trump's decision would weaken a ""strategic partner.""

""I mean, so DOD was concerned about the obligation of funds,"" she said. ""Policy, my team, we were also concerned about any signal that we would send to Ukraine about a wavering in our commitment. ... They are trying to negotiate a peace with Russia, and if they are seen as weak, and if they are seen to lack the backing of the United States for their Armed Forces, it makes it much more difficult for them to negotiate a peace on terms that are good for Ukraine.""

She added: ""My sense is that all of the senior leaders of the U.S. national security departments and agencies were all unified in their — in their view that this assistance was essential, and they were trying to find ways to engage the president on this.""

Croft, meanwhile, told House investigators, ""If this were public in Ukraine it would be seen as a reversal of our policy and would, just to say sort of candidly and colloquially, this would be a really big deal, it would be a really big deal in Ukraine, and an expression of declining U.S. support for Ukraine.""

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL FLAGGED HUNTER BIDEN'S 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST' IN UKRAINE, TESTIMONY SHOWS

Ukraine had satisfied all necessary benchmarks to obtain Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funding, Cooper told lawmakers. This past May, Cooper said, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood ""provided the certification to Congress, but that was after coordination with the State Department.""

Cooper also told investigators she could make a ""very strong inference"" that Ukraine was aware in August that the Trump administration was holding up the financial assistance, shortly before the aid was released in September. The Ukraine aid was suspended temporarily in August -- two weeks before the White House released it, Politico reported.

""It could have been my inference, yes, a very strong inference that there was some knowledge on the part of the Ukrainians,"" Cooper testified. She called the aid suspension, which came without an explanation to her knowledge, ""unusual.""

Military aid to Ukraine, Cooper further testified, was relevant to U.S. national-security interests.

DIPLOMAT TESTIFIES WHITE HOUSE USED MILITARY AID, TOP-LEVEL MEETING AS LEVERAGE TO GET CORRUPTION PROBES

""Ukraine, and also Georgia, are the two front-line states facing Russian aggression,"" Cooper said. ""In order to deter further Russian aggression, we need to be able to shore up these countries' abilities to defend themselves. That's, I think, pure and simple, the rationale behind our strategy of supporting these countries. It's in our interest to deter Russian aggression elsewhere around the world.""

Trump's suggested in his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the country investigate Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings there, after it emerged that Joe Biden, the former vice president and current 2020 presidential candidate, had pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor while Hunter Biden held a lucrative role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. Zelensky has said he felt no improper pressure during the call.

In a statement, top House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry noted that Cooper's testimony indicated that Trump's Ukraine policy angered some officials in the administration.

“Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper testified that President Trump, through the Office of Management and Budget, directed the freeze on hundreds of millions of dollars of critical military aid for Ukraine, against the judgment of career officials in the Department of Defense, Department of State, and other relevant agencies,"" read the statement, issued by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and Oversight Committee Acting Chair Carolyn Maloney of New York.

""Cooper also told the committees that she raised concerns, as did others on several occasions, to senior U.S. government officials about the legality of withholding the congressionally-authorized money, and the challenges that White House delays would put on spending it,"" the Democrats continued.

Welcome to the club. Bloomberg’s conclusion, although self-serving, reflects a general unease among many Democrats. Mere months ago, the party was celebrating a field of 25 candidates who comprised a Noah’s Ark of group identities, but the mood has changed dramatically.

After panderfest forums, boring speeches and inconclusive debates, many Dems now sound like Peggy Lee as they ask, “Is that all there is?”

While most remain wildly enthusiastic about defeating Trump, they are far from ready to unite behind a single candidate. Even worse, the ideological split in the party is so serious that it might not be healed before Election Day.

Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said on Sunday that the evidence he has seen from the depositions given in the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump amounts to an “extortion scheme” by the White House.

Speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Swalwell – a member of the House Intelligence Committee – said that while President Trump is owed his due process rights, he believes the evidence shows the administration using taxpayer dollars to investigate Trump’s political opponents in the 2020 election.

“It’s important that the president has due process, and evidence is not a conclusion,” Swalwell said. “We have enough evidence from the depositions that we’ve done to warrant bringing this forward, evidence of an extortion scheme using taxpayer dollars to ask a foreign government to investigate the president’s opponents.""

TRUMP-UKRAINE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY TO START 'OPEN HEARINGS' NOV. 13, SCHIFF SAYS

Swalwell added: “It’s important that these witnesses raise their right hands and take questions from both Republicans and Democrats… It’s important that the Republicans are afforded the opportunity to suggest which witnesses we should call and we’ll decide whether that’s relevant.”

Swalwell also lambasted Republican calls for the former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, to come before the House – saying that “we’re not going to go back in time and revisit conspiracy theories that were implicated in the president’s call.”

Trump has sought to implicate Biden and his son, Hunter, in his July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.

The first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry are scheduled to be held next Wednesday and Friday, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.

The first public hearing will feature Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who already testified behind closed doors before congressional investigators that the president pushed Ukraine to investigate election interference, Biden and his son and their Ukrainian dealings — and that he was told U.S. military aid and a White House meeting were used as leverage to get a public announcement from Kiev that the probes were underway.

George Kent, the deputy assistant Secretary of State, also will appear with Taylor. Kent testified behind closed doors last month, and told the committees that he had concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, in 2015, but was rebuffed by the former vice president’s staff, which said the office was preoccupied with Beau Biden’s cancer battle."

Bolton's deal with Simon & Schuster is worth about $2 million, two publishing officials familiar with the negotiations told AP. The officials didn't know when the book would be released or its title, and spoke anonymously to the AP because they were not authorized to publicly discuss it.

Bolton was represented by the Javelin literary agency, whose clients include former FBI Director James Comey and the anonymous Trump administration official whose book, ""A Warning,"" comes out Nov. 19. Neither Javelin nor Simon & Schuster responded to Fox News requests for comment.

The conservative Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Bolton's 2007 book ""Surrender is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad.""

Bolton, a foreign policy hawk, left the White House in September over clashes with President Trump, who said he fired Bolton because he ""disagreed strongly"" with his suggestions. Bolton quickly challenged Trump's assertion, saying he had offered to resign.

The two disagreed on a number of national security issues, including the plans for a drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

BOLTON WARNED OF 'HAND GRENADE' GIULIANI, SHUT DOWN UKRAINE MEETING, AIDE TOLD IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Bolton has returned to the spotlight during the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump's request of his Ukrainian counterpart to ""look into” former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's dealings in the Eastern European country. The probe stems from a whistleblower complaint about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky during which Democrats claim Trump offered a ""quid pro quo"" in exchange for withheld U.S. military aid.

Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, said in a letter to the top lawyer for the House of Representatives Friday that his client was involved in ""many relevant meetings and conversations"" to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, but suggested that Bolton will only appear before Congress if a judge orders it.

A former top White House expert on Russia, Fiona Hill, testified that Bolton had warned that Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was a ""hand grenade"" who was ""going to blow up everyone,"" and distanced himself from the efforts to leverage Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, according to transcripts released Friday.

Hill also described how Bolton had ""immediately stiffened"" as Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland ""blurted out"" that he had worked out a trade -- the Ukrainians' probe for an Oval Office welcome for Kiev's new president -- with Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. According to Hill, Bolton later told her that ""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up"" and asked her to relay that message to a White House lawyer.

Appointed in April 2018, Bolton was Trump's third national security adviser. In a speech in late September to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, given after he left the administration, Bolton offered a far more aggressive approach to North Korea's nuclear program than the one advocated by Trump, who has spoken warmly about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

""Every day that goes by makes North Korea a more dangerous country,"" Bolton said. ""You don't like their behavior today, what do you think it will be when they have nuclear weapons that can be delivered to American cities?""

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, to the House Intelligence Committee ahead of the upcoming impeachment hearings was to add a foil to the committee’s Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California.

“Jim Jordan has been in all these depositions and been part of it,” McCarthy said during an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “But [Adam Schiff] is trying to control everything.”

McCarthy announced on Friday that Jordan, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee and a staunch defender of President Trump, would temporarily replace Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., for the duration of the hearings.

TRUMP CLAIMS IMPEACHMENT MAKING HIM 'STRONGER,' RAILS AGAINST WHISTLEBLOWER

“Jim Jordan has been on the front lines in the fight for fairness and truth. His addition will ensure more accountability and transparency in this sham process,"" McCarthy said in a statement on Friday.

Under current terms, Jordan, as the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, has been in the room for most closed-door depositions. Because he is not a member of the Intelligence Committee, though, the Ohio Republican cannot ask questions.

A senior House Democratic aide tells Fox News that Democrats allowed the personnel shift because “it is customary that whoever the minority proposes is accepted.”

Jordan would not have been on the dais during open hearings this week to counterpunch. Republican leadership all week had been weighing the Jordan move, and considering adding Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., as well. But in order to position Jordan on the panel, Republican leadership is required to remove one of the current Republicans on the panel. Removing three, to also include Meadows and Zeldin, would be somewhat of a feat.

The assignment comes just days before the first open hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, next Friday, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, will appear in a public setting. She testified last month behind closed doors as well, telling lawmakers that Ukraine told her about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s campaign to oust her from her post in the administration. Yovanovitch was pushed out of her job in May on Trump’s orders.

Yovanovitch said she learned from Ukrainian officials last November or December that Giuliani was in touch with Ukraine’s former top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, “and that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me.”

The impeachment inquiry was opened after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.

A transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any quid pro quo. Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.

The White House, though, has maintained the president did nothing wrong.

The House of Representatives, last week, passed a measure largely along party lines, formalizing the process and setting “ground rules” for the impeachment inquiry, including for public witness testimony.

On Veterans Day, several candidates rolled out proposals to meet the needs of America's 20 million former service members.

Trump, speaking in New York City's Veterans Day Parade, praised the strength of the U.S. military and the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying the nation's veterans ""risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives."" More than 100 protesters booed and held black balloons that read ""support our troops, impeach.""

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said female veterans and service members have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.

""I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,"" Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. His comments went a step beyond his 21-page wide-ranging plan released on Monday.

""The president has let veterans down,"" Buttigieg said.

Of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level roles, four have never been held by a woman: Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury and White House chief of staff. Buttigieg says he'd take a close look at appointing a female defense secretary as well.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would seek to build on substantial gains for vets that were started under the Obama-Biden administration, such as stemming homelessness and improving mental health care.

Biden said he would ""restore trust"" in the VA after failed leadership, putting in place at least one full-time women's primary care physician at each VA medical center to boost women's health care and provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury.

He said as president he would publish a comprehensive strategy to address veterans' suicide within his first 200 days in office and hire additional staff to ensure that in his first year of office wait times for vets at risk of suicide are reduce to zero.

""Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,"" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife Jill.

In a dig at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video on Monday highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.

Trump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program, ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by President Barack Obama. What Trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders.

That expanded program, one of Trump's signature accomplishments, seeks to steer more veterans over the next decade to private-sector doctors outside the VA.

Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who voted against Trump's plan, says the expanded program goes too far in its investments in the private sector, rather than core VA health care , which many veterans view as better suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Sanders joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.

Sanders said he would fill those vacancies in his first year as president and provide at least $62 billion in new funding to repair and modernize VA facilities to provide cutting-edge care.

""We will not dismantle or privatize the VA. We will expand and improve the VA,"" Sanders said Monday.

Buttigieg told the AP that he would look at rolling back some of the Trump administration's rules expanding Choice.

All the Democratic candidates who have articulated veterans' plans call for added funding and training for suicide prevention.

Currently, about 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.

Buttigieg, like Warren, would seek to improve responses to sexual assault in the military by shifting prosecution from military commanders to independent prosecutors. He also wants to put particular focus on stemming homelessness among women vets, many of whom may have experienced sexual trauma.

He pointed to his seven-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 and watching the impact a female general had ""culturally"" on the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.

""When a leadership body is more gender diverse, it makes better decisions. So I would absolutely be looking at that,"" Buttigieg told the AP. He's previously pledged to appoint women to at least 50% of his Cabinet positions.

While veterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.

Currently, about 10% of the nation's veterans are female. In the U.S. military forces, about 17% of those enlisted are women, up from about 2% in 1973."

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

The House Democratic effort to impeach President Trump moves into a key new phase this week, public hearings, in which career government officials will testify on camera about how President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The big question: will this change the dynamic of the inquiry that so far has remained strictly partisan?

In a moment, we'll speak with two members of the House Intelligence Committee that will hold the made-for-TV hearings, Republican Will Hurd and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

But, first, let's bring in Ellison Barber, who has the latest from the White House -- Ellison.

ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, one of the first witnesses we expect to hear from this week is a career diplomat who testified behind closed doors. It was his understanding that everything, military aid and an Oval Office visit, was contingent on Ukraine investigating the Bidens in 2016.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BARBER: The 45th president cheered at the game of the century hours before the start of the week that could turn his political future upside down. Three public hearings are set to take place on two different dates. On Wednesday, the House Intelligence Committee will hear from a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine and a top State Department official. On Friday, the former ambassador to Ukraine.

House Democrats released their closed door testimonies this week. William Taylor's arguably the most explosive. The career the diplomat testified it was his clear understanding security assistance money would not come until the president of Ukraine committed to pursue the investigations President Trump wanted.

President Trump continues to call the inquiry --

TRUMP: The witch hunt continues --

BARBER: But claims his party is on the same page.

TRUMP: The Republicans have never been so united.

BARBER: Congressional Republicans want to hear from at least 14 witnesses, including former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter and the whistle- blower whose complaint help initiate the impeachment inquiry.

Chairman Adam Schiff responding with a warning: The committee will not serve as vehicles to carry out sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016.

BARBER: Rules approved by the House essentially give Democrats veto power here. It witnesses must be approved by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee or the full committee -- Chris.

WALLACE: Ellison Barber, reporting from the White House -- Ellison, thank you.

BARBER: You bet.

WALLACE: Joining me now, Congressman Will Hurd, a Republican member of the House Intel Committee that will conduct those public hearings this week.

Congressman Hurd, the top Republican on House Intel, Devin Nunes, says that he would like to call the whistle-blower, the unnamed whistle-blower, to testify in public in these hearings.

And here's what President Trump has to say about the whistle-blower.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The whistle-blower is a disgrace to our country, a disgrace, and the whistle-blower, because of that, should be revealed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Now, the whistle-blower reportedly works for the CIA, where you worked for almost a decade.

Should his identity be revealed? Should be he called to testify in public?

REP. WILL HURD, R-TX: I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistle-blower. I've said that from the very beginning, because how we treat this whistle-blower will impact whistle-blowers in the future. Having this whistle-blower law on the books is important. It's an important checks and balance not only in the Intelligence Committee, but our government.

But what I do would like to see happen is for Adam Schiff, Chairman Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, to answer questions about what was his engagement with the whistle-blower before the information, his (ph) -- the whistle-blower's allegations were transmitted to the -- to Congress.

He has misled the American public earlier in the year on what he knew about -- or the contact that he had with the whistle-blower. So if you want to protect the identity of the whistle-blower, I think it's important for Chairman Schiff to answer questions about his interactions with them (ph).

WALLACE: What to think about as the Republicans are seeking, calling Hunter Biden, the vice president -- the former vice president's son, as a witness?

HURD: I would love to hear from Hunter Biden, I would love to hear from other Americans that served on the board of Burisma. I'm curious to know of someone who doesn't have any experience in Ukraine nor experience in a natural gas company becomes (ph) on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine.

You know, this is -- we also need to hear and understand the corruption. We know corruption in the Ukraine is an issue. And Ambassador Taylor has said that in his testimony. Dr. Hill has said that in her testimony. This is something that was a concern even in this current new administration in Ukraine.

So, hearing from people that can help provide insights into that, since that is, you know, central to this conversation would be -- would be valuable.

WALLACE: Now, Congressman Schiff responded last night to the GOP witness list that had been offered by Chairman Nunes and here's what Schiff said: The Intel Committee will not be used, quote, to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens and 2016 that the president wanted Ukraine to conduct.

Given that response, Congressman Hurd, what does that say about the fairness of a process that the Democrats are running and holding these hearings?

HURD: Unfortunately, Chris, this has been a partisan exercise from the very beginning. When one piece of information comes, people that don't like the president say, oh, this is an example for impeachment. People that support the president say, this is a -- you know, evidence of an exoneration.

I think we should just turn over every rock and pursue every lead to ultimately get to the truth. And it's unfortunate that the Democrats on the committee and the Democrats in the House have created this partisan exercise.

In a normal hearing, the minority, the folks that are not in power, have the ability to offer a witness. We can't do that in this case.

Under previous impeachment inquiries, the minority and the president has had the opportunity to call witnesses, be involved.

You -- the majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman Schiff has prevented some of the lawyers for the administration to come in and be there with the folks that were -- that were testifying. That's not a fair process.

If we're interested in trying to uncover the truth, then let's not -- let's not put our thumb on the scale. But unfortunately, that's what this process has been and what's even crazier is there trying to have this completed by the end of the year, and I think we only have 16 or 17 legislative days left in the year. Half of those days are what's called ""fly-in, fly-out"" days where people are coming in from their location.

So, to try to get that, try to pass NAFTA, to fund the government -- to try to do all that in that short period of time, I think that's next to impossible.

WALLACE: You -- you talk about the extreme partisanship, maybe on both sides, Republicans and Democrats. You are not -- while you're supportive of the president, you are not a party line supportive. You oppose some of his policies, for instance, constructing the border wall. You've opposed and have spoken out against some of his language during his time in office.

For you, what specifically do you want to learn from these hearings?

HURD: So, I think talk about impeachment has been premature. I think impeachment is one of the most important and consequential things a member of Congress can do. And I think there's 535 different opinions on what impeachment is. To evaluate -- to evaluate that question I think it's a violation of the law.

So, I want to see, does this establish a criminal intent? And yes, for me, I agree when I agree, I disagree when I disagree.

And having spent nine-and-a-half years as an undercover officer in the CIA, I was a guy in the back alleys collecting intelligence. I also did this to embassies. I know how embassies work.

And the fact that Ukrainian officials weren't contacting their U.S. counterparts until August 29th, when they read in -- I believe it was a political article about aid being withheld. That was the first time that any Ukrainian had contacted a State Department or government official about this. That was more than a month after the July 25th phone call between the president and President Zelensky.

WALLACE: So --

(CROSSTALK)

HURD: What do I want to see?

WALLACE: Go ahead, sir.

HURD: Go ahead, Chris.

WALLACE: No, you go ahead.

HURD: What -- what I want to see is their inability to establish criminal intent. Do the Ukrainians know that this -- you know, this was some kind of a quid pro quo?

You know, when you look at our relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine over the last three years, there's been no more aid going to Ukraine this year than -- in this administration than the previous administration. Ukraine is an important partner.

WALLACE: Let me ask you specifically though about this because there seem to be two issues that were part of the quid pro quo. One was military aid. One was the meeting that the Ukrainians very much wanted between their President Zelensky and President Trump.

All three of the witnesses that are going to testify this week -- you see them up there, William Taylor, George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch, all career foreign service officers, said there was a clear connection between support for Ukraine, at various forms of the U.S. support for Ukraine, and Ukraine investigating the Democrats.

If you are satisfied that that is true, that there was this connection, this nexus, is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: Well, I don't know if it was necessarily investigate the Democrats, right? I think it was investigation of corruption. And so, people have made assumption of what is --

WALLACE: Forgive me, sir, but specifically --

HURD: Sure.

WALLACE: -- what President Trump said on that July 25th phone call was investigate the Democratic role in the 2016 election, whether they were involved in hacking the DNC server and also, specifically, the Bidens and Burisma.

HURD: Well, on the 2016 elections -- now, some of that information was based on what has been kind of fringe thinking. But back when even Democrats start investigating the Russian involvement on 2016 elections, there was a Ukraine nexus.

And so, trying to get to the bottom of that, is that a violation of the law? Now, was that an understanding based on debunked information? Yes. But is that a violation of the law? I don't think so.

You mentioned of the Bidens --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But specifically, sir, the question, is if there was a quid pro quo, U.S. aid for Ukraine was going to depend on their doing these investigations of political rivals of the president. Is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing. I think everybody has -- most Republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law.

WALLACE: So, that, in your view, if that were established to your satisfaction, if, I repeat, that would be an impeachable offense?

HURD: I believe that's something that would make it -- make it -- have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.

WALLACE: And we will see what happens this week and whether or not it persuades you.

Congressman Hurd, thank you so much. Thanks for your time. Good to talk with you, sir.

HURD: Thank you, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll get reaction from a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee about what some say is his party's timetable to impeach the president before the end of the year.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: House Republicans have complained for weeks about Democrats interviewing key witnesses in the impeachment probe behind closed doors. Well, now, the public hearings are about to start. The GOP is still complaining.

Let's bring in Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.

Congressman, as I discussed with Congressman Hurd, Republicans have now put out their written list of witnesses. It includes Hunter Biden, the unnamed whistle-blower, and Nellie Ohr, who folks may remember, she worked for Fusion GPS, which sought information from sources in Ukraine in 2016 and put up the Steele dossier.

Will Democrats agree to call any of these witnesses? And if you don't, what does that say about the fairness of this entire proceeding?

REP. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, D-N.Y.: Well, I can't speak for the chairman, but what I can tell you is that I think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list. And here's my test -- my test is, do these witnesses have important information, knowledge, or evidence about the president's conduct? And if it passes that test, then we should call them, sure.

WALLACE: So, let's ask specifically. Hunter Biden, Nellie Ohr, the unnamed whistle-blower -- do any of them pass that test and therefore should be called?

MALONEY: The first two, no. The third one, you've just heard Congressman Hurd give a very eloquent explanation of why we don't force the revelation of a whistle-blower's identity. So, no in all three cases, but for different reasons.

WALLACE: Well, I mean, let's -- let's focus on Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden is at the center of this. There are allegations of corruption. You know, there certainly are questions why a fellow named Hunter Biden would get a big job in Ukraine when his father was then the vice president and conducting relations with Ukraine.

Isn't that a fair person to talk to?

MALONEY: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Wallace, what information Mr. Biden, Hunter Biden, a private citizen who was broke no laws by serving on the board of directors, would have about the president's withholding of military aid to Ukraine? In other words, he has no knowledge of what the president did or didn't do here, that is the subject of the impeachment inquiry.

There are certainly questions, of course, and many people have asked them, but it's not relevant to this week's hearings.

WALLACE: So, you know, I don't have the list right in front of me, but you obviously saw it. You're a member of the committee. Which member of the Republican potential witnesses would you agree to call?

MALONEY: Again, there are witnesses on the Republican list who have been interviewed in depositions already and, of course, those transcripts are going to be released fully. And so, I would expect the witnesses who have been interviewed, because they have material information, would be likely called in public, but again, those are not --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: For instance, Kurt Volker, who was a special emissary to Ukraine?

MALONEY: Mr. Volker testified for the committee, so did Mr. Morrison. Those witnesses are on the list. Mr. Hale is similarly a witness who's been interviewed, is on the list. Those are the witnesses I have in mind.

But again, this is not my decision. I can't speak for the chairman, but those witnesses do have material information about the president's conduct in this case. That's the proper focus of this inquiry.

And if I could just say, Chris, you know, I hope your viewers will keep an open mind. You know, this is Veterans Day weekend, God bless all who serve and where the country's uniform as my dad did, as my grandfather did.

You know, these are also military veterans. Ambassador Taylor was an infantry officer with 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, served in combat.

WALLACE: Right.

MALONEY: West Point graduate. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman earned a Purple Heart in Iraq.

These are -- these are veterans and credible witnesses. I hope people will keep an open mind and hear their testimony unfiltered and read the transcript. By all means, they are all coming out in public.

WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about another -- apparently non-witness at this point and that his national security advisor -- former national security advisor John Bolton. Here is what his lawyer wrote this week to the committee: Bolton was involved, according to his lawyer, in many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.

Continuing the quote: If the House chooses not to pursue through subpoena the testimony of Ambassador Bolton, let the record be clear, that is the House's decision.

Isn't -- Congressman, isn't John Bolton perhaps the best witness other than the president as to what was going on inside the Oval Office? And why on earth wouldn't you wait to see what he has to say?

MALONEY: We have -- we have invited Ambassador Bolton to appear, and that sounds like a nervous lawyer to me, because they are -- they are refusing to honor a legal request to provide relevant testimony.

WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait --

MALONEY: Excuse me --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Let me just -- wait a minute. But the point is he has gone to a judge and said, you tell us, I got an order from the White House, I got an order from Congress, you tell me what to do.

MALONEY: Right. Mr. Wallace, that's not how it works. You show up and you respond to a subpoena or you go to a judge and get it quashed, or you show up and you invoke a legitimate privilege and refused to answer a particular question.

It is unprecedented to say, you, Congress, go to a judge and tell me to appear. That's not how it works, and Ambassador Bolton is a better lawyer than that. He knows that personally.

WALLACE: Wait. That isn't what they're doing. They're not saying, Congress, go to the judge. They are going to the judge.

That's what they did with Charles Kupperman, another one of the clients who was an assistant to a deputy to Bolton and Bolton -- they are going to the judge and they're saying, judge, we've got these competing claims, you tell us what to do. They're not asking the House to do anything.

MALONEY: Mr. Wallace, I agree with you that he has important information and we would love to hear from Ambassador Bolton. I think the public deserves to hear from Ambassador Bolton, who remember call this a drug deal and wanted nothing to do with it, who instructed his subordinates to report this conversations to the lawyers at the White House because he knew they were improper.

Ambassador Bolton does have important information. I don't understand why the White House has instructed him not to cooperate. You should ask them.

WALLACE: Yes. I guess what I'm saying is this is an impeachment. This isn't just oversight. This is the potential impeachment of the president of the United States.

There is going to be a court hearing in early December, Charles Kupperman, the deputy to Bolton and Bolton now would be part of that suit.

Why not wait -- we're talking about a month, exactly a month, to find out what a judge says? Why wouldn't, when you're talking about the impeachment of the president, why wouldn't the House Intelligence Committee be willing to wait to find out such key evidence?

MALONEY: Again, we would love to have Mr. Bolton's evidence. There's nothing preventing him from giving it. But remember -- oh, and by the way, any notion that that's going to be favorable to the president I think is debunked by everything in the public domain already.

Ambassador Bolton called this a drug deal. I'm not sure the president will want to hear from Ambassador Bolton, but we sure do.

But here's the point. The point is, do we have sufficient evidence from credible witnesses that we're going to present in public testimony to move forward with an inquiry which may result in a referral to the Senate, where there will be a trial, where witnesses like Ambassador Bolton will have an opportunity again to provide the information they know. I encourage them to do it now, I encourage them to do it then and I don't think it will be favorable to the president. It is Ambassador Bolton who saw clearly how abusive and inappropriate the president's conduct was.

WALLACE: You know, he's not going to be -- testify because you guys have a timetable that you want to get this done by the end of the year.

Let me ask you a couple questions to finish this up. President Trump now says that he is going to release the transcript of a phone call -- not the July 25th a phone call that we've already seen but an earlier phone call in April just after President Zelensky was inaugurated between the two presidents.

What value does not transcript have for your committee and your investigation?

MALONEY: Well, I don't know of any evidence that would be relevant from the first phone call except that it was a routine phone call to congratulate the president. If the president wants to release it, that's fine. I don't think it's relevant to this investigation.

WALLACE: Let's turn to the public hearings this week. You've got three witnesses testifying, we've already seen the transcripts of their interviews. People know what they're going to say.

Is the argument that you're basically -- people are going to read the book but they're going to see the movie? Because that didn't work out very well in the Robert Mueller testimony.

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, the point is that the Republicans have been demanding for weeks that the public be able to see this testimony. So, you know, they should take yes for an answer. I think it's very important that the public be able to judge for itself.

And I really encourage your viewers to just watch the hearings. Read the transcripts or watch it live and make up your own minds. You won't have any filter. You won't have the press or politicians in the way. You'll have witnesses giving opening statements.

And these are military veterans. These are career nonpartisan civil servants. The first witness, Ambassador Bill Taylor --

(CROSSTALK)

MALONEY: Excuse me, is an appointee of a Republican president who serve this country in the military. I think we should give him a chance.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Sir, you've already made that point and I would like to get -- I'm running out of time, I'd like to get one last question in if I might.

Here's what President Trump says about all those witnesses. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: The testimony has all been fine. I mean, for the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are. It seems that nobody has any first-hand knowledge, there is no firsthand knowledge.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: The president does have a point. None of these officials actually talked to the president.

When we think back to John Dean with Richard Nixon, he took us into the Oval Office. He told what he told the president and what the president told him.

As the president says, all of the information we're going to hear this week is secondhand. Is that enough to impeach a president?

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, if you're talking about this week -- but, of course, there witnesses like Ambassador Sondland, who spoke directly to the president. There are other witnesses who have refused to cooperate.

By the way, the State Department has refused to produce all the notes and corroborating evidence, but there are absolutely direct witnesses to the president's phone call. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was on the call and went immediately to the embassy legal department because he knew it was wrong, what he heard. That's a military veteran.

There are a lot of people with direct knowledge and it's -- honestly, if I can say, it is heartbreaking to hear the president, any American president, deride an important process where reliable witnesses are giving information. It's also heartbreaking to realize once you see this evidence that any American president would engage in misconduct. You know, it gives me no pleasure to tell you the American president has abused his office and he should be accountable.

WALLACE: Well, as you say, people are going to get to see for themselves this week.

Congressman Maloney, thank you, thanks for joining us. And, of course, FOX News will cover the hearings this week live.

MALONEY: Thank you.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether anything will change now that the public will hear from these witnesses themselves.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Democratic front runner Joe Biden reacts to Michael Bloomberg looking at a run for the White House.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In terms of he's running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel how a Bloomberg campaign would shake up the Democratic race. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves, but also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: As we are more testimony, in fact the testimony that we're hearing today, it's actually getting easier to defend the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff and Republican Congressman Mark Meadows setting very different expectations for this week's public impeachment hearings.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff, Josh Holmes.

Congresswoman Edwards, let me start with you.

What do you expect these public hearings to accomplish? We know what these witnesses are going to say. They -- we -- they -- their opening statements were leaked. Their full hours long transcripts have been -- have been put out there for anybody who's interested to read. They've been widely covered. It doesn't seem to have moved anybody. I mean the Democrats are foursquare in favor of impeachment and there doesn't seem to have been a single vote that's been swayed so far at least by House Republicans in favor of impeachment.

So what's the point?

DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-MD: Well, I mean, now it's time for the American people to see the evidence. I mean let's admit it, even -- I've read some of the transcripts but haven't read all of them and I think for the American people to be able to see these witnesses, to know their, you know, their backgrounds and that they are public servants and that they have a sense of duty coming before the committee, and I think that that will be really compelling.

And, you know, maybe it's not about swaying individual members of Congress right now, but it's about making sure that the American people put it out there because Congress are followers, right? They'll follow the public. And I think that it's really important for the American people to hear the lawlessness and the unconstitutional behavior of the president of the United States.

WALLACE: Karl, let's talk about the -- what we're going to hear in terms of the testimony this week. You worked in a White House. We're going to hear from three career foreign service officers. One of them, William Taylor, a military veteran, has served presidents since 1985. Ronald Reagan. They're going to talk about an off the books foreign policy. They're going to talk about an ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who was smeared and recalled because of comments that were being made, a campaign being run by Rudy Giuliani, allegedly. They're going to hear about a link between U.S. support for Ukraine and Ukraine conducting investigations of the president's political rivals.

Obviously there's another side to the story, but that story, does it bother you?

KARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, as somebody who served in the White House, it does bother me, yes. But, on the other hand, there is constant friction between the State Department and an administration. We saw this during the Iraq War, where we had the people in the State Department leaking against the administration's policy. But, look, that's going to be the sideshow.

The thing that's going to happen when we have this testimony is, is that the Republicans are going to be able to ask questions. Think about where we've been. We have selective leaks of what -- of what these people said, which is done to spin it as much as possible against the president. Then we have their entire transcripts, which most people don't read. Now we're going to have televised hearings in which they're going to be able to say their piece and it's going to have an impact, but there also going to be questioned. And the questioning is going to get to, you know, we have a quid. Military aid and assistance for Ukraine. And we have a quo. And that quo is, investigative the Bidens and any other American involved in corruption. But so far we don't have the pro, the for, that is to say that what we know today is, is that the Ukrainians were never aware of a delay in their aid until they were given the aid and told that it had been delayed. And we never had that grant of the aid predicated upon them making a commitment to investigate Joe Biden.

And we're -- and the failure of the Democrats -- Schiff's statement last night was very problematic because the American people are going to want to hear about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and Devon Archer (ph) and this stinky situation involving Burisma. And if the Democrats say, we're not going to allow you to have those people called, it's just going to simply add to the impression that this is a partisan witch hunt.

WALLACE: Mo.

MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE: Ambassador Sondland did revise his testimony to say he did inform the Ukrainians that the aid would likely be contingent on this. So that's -- that's about where we are on that point.

Look, ultimately, I agree with the congresswoman, that now the American people get to see this stuff. And if you think about this politically and what actually -- you know, based on the very few precedents we have in American history on this, looking back on Richard Nixon, Republicans were with him. Republican voters were with him up until the very end. The day he left, the polling show that about 30 percent of Republicans thought he should be removed from office. But that 30 percent was a significant number because that's what put a lot of pressure on the Republican members of the Senate, when Barry Goldwater finally broke with the president and went to him and said, Mr. President, you know I've been your guy but it's become unsustainable for us. Right now you don't see that kind of breaking from Republican voters.

So the question becomes, do these hearings, as the congresswoman was saying, begin to mobilize and catalyze Republican voters? We know it's doing it for Democrats and we know it's doing it for independent voters.

WALLACE: But here's the question I have, and let me bring in Josh on this, because I understand that, you know, we pay much more attention to the leaks, we pay much more attention to the transcripts than most people do, but they are out there and they have been widely reported. They've been the lead on the evening news. They've been on the front page of the papers. And so far, Josh, it hasn't moved a single Republican vote.

JOSH HOLMES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Nor has it moved the Republican primary electorate. I mean I think, Mo, you have a good point there and what ultimately did in Nixon was his party basically beginning to turn on him. If you look at the American people right now, in particular the Republican primary electorate, not only are they not moving away from the president, it's heartening. I mean you've got numbers in 85 plus in terms of their view of this being a quote/unquote witch hunt.

So I -- look, we're a long way away from Republicans moving away from President Trump and embracing an impeachment inquiry. My guess is an open hearing in the House will only serve to exacerbate that. I don't think there's any chance that this is going to come off looking like a fair hearing or something that the president has had basically his say in.

WALLACE: I mean, that is the concern, I mean, that it hasn't moved the needle. And we've gotten a lot of information so far. I don't -- I mean I understand a TV -- well, I don't know if I understand because we -- everybody kept saying, you know, they won't read the book, they'll watch the movie and the Mueller hearing turned out to be a disaster for Democrats, I think we would agree.

So let's assume that this is more effective than Robert Mueller as a -- as a witness. Does it really move the needle? Because it hasn't so far, congresswoman.

EDWARDS: Well, look, this is actually very different kinds of behavior even than what we saw in the Mueller report. I mean we have a president of the United States who withheld aid from an ally who was, you know, on the front lines against our chief adversary. And I think when the American people here that it wasn't -- this isn't about 2016, this is about what is happening right now in 2020 prospectively for the 2020 election. And I think that these witnesses are going to make all the difference.

I mean when you look at a lieutenant colonel, Vindman, for example, you know, he'll be there and he'll be in his dress blues and, you know, fully decorated, raising his hand saying that he's telling the truth.

I defy Republicans to challenge on that. They are not challenging on the substance, they are challenging on process, and that is a loser argument.

WALLACE: All right, you get the final word.

ROVE: Process matters, fairness matters, that's why Nixon went down because the process was fair. This is not fair. They won't allow the -- they've got allowed the president any of the rights granted to President Clinton during his impeachment, or any of the rights granted to President Nixon during his impeachment.

And I love the fact -- I love the fact that the Democrats are now decrying the president's decision not to move aid -- lethal aid rapidly to Ukraine. After all, the previous administration, a Democratic administration, did nothing to send lethal aid to Ukraine and the nonlethal aid they refused to fly into Ukraine on C-130s because they didn't want U.S. military presence in Ukraine. So they drop them off in Poland and citizens had to take that nonlethal aid and put it in the back of their little vehicles and trucks and convey it to Ukraine.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: So this president at least had the guts to give the Ukrainians the lethal aid needed to stave off the Russian attempts to subvert that country.

WALLACE: Well, I think this is probably going to end up being a game changer and we're -- it will be a bipartisan game changer.

Panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg looks ready to make a late entry into the 2020 Democratic race. Can he win the nomination?

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the impact of a Bloomberg candidacy? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at “Fox News Sunday” and we may use your question on the air.

MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: There's nobody I'd rather run against the little Michael.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, sorry, you ain't gonna buy this election!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Well, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg getting pretty strong push back from both President Trump and Democratic Candidate Bernie Sanders on a possible run for the White House.

And we're back now with the panel.

Mo, let me start with you.

Does Michael Bloomberg have a realistic path to the Democratic nomination, and what do you think of what his strategists say if he does get in, and it seems likely will, his plan, skip the first four, skip Iowa, skip New Hampshire, and basically begin your campaign on Super Tuesday in early March?

ELLEITHEE: Yes, look, it's an uphill climb, I would think, for -- for Mayor Bloomberg. And there's no evidence -- we've never seen anyone who has successfully tried to skip the early states and go on to win the nomination. Not at least in the modern era. We've seen candidates who have tried to skip a state, skip Iowa and go straight to New Hampshire, skip New Hampshire and so to South Carolina --

WALLACE: Rudy Giuliani wanted to skip them all and go to Florida. That doesn't work out so well.

ELLEITHEE: Right, it just doesn't -- it doesn't work out so well.

But I think what Bloomberg is hoping here is that he can position himself to be sort of the moderate's last line of defense against the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders wing of the party. That if Biden stumbles and is falling behind --

WALLACE: And right now he's in fourth place in Iowa and -- and not leading in New Hampshire either.

ELLEITHEE: And that whoever sort of stumbles out of those early states is going to be spent in terms of resources and organization. And those later states, to his credit, are sort of more air war states than they are ground game states. He's got the money to invest heavily in advertising, that he can be the guy who can sort of be the moderates' last line of defense. I think -- I'm a little skeptical that it works, but it is a strategy that, you know, that if Biden stumbles, it looks like he's going to, you know, try to put himself in position to execute.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the possibility that Michael Bloomberg will get into this race, we got this on Facebook from Brad Yates. He writes, how does Bloomberg's stance on corporations stand against the current Democrat party's push toward socialism?

Congressman Edwards, how do you answer Brad basically on the -- on the question, is he just way too far to the right for this current Democratic Party?

EDWARDS: Well, I think that -- I mean I think that's a reasonable question but, look, there's no push toward socialism in the Democratic Party. But I do think that there is an understandable concern about income inequality and the -- a Michael Bloomberg candidacy actually puts that front and center. And the question of, are we going to allow 749 billionaires to control all of the wealth of 60 percent, the bottom 60 percent of Americans? And I think that's a legitimate debate for Democrats to have. We've been having that in our -- within our party.

WALLACE: How about the argument that billionaires like Bill Gates, like Michael Bloomberg, create enormous wealth and tremendous job opportunity and that that's actually what kind of feeds the bulldog?

EDWARDS: Absolutely they do and I worked for a corporation early in my career and I think that that is important.

But the question is, how do you pay your fair share to make certain that other Americans can aspire to their highest dreams too? Creating that wealth but also creating other opportunities for other Americans. I think that is a front and center debate of the Democratic Party and I think Michael Bloomberg's candidacy puts it right there in the middle.

And, you know, I'm looking forward to the debate because I think we've been engaged in this conversation for a long time and it's going to be important for any Democrat who wins in the Democratic primary to be able to unite the party. And I'm really not sure that a Michael Bloomberg is a candidate that can come and unite all of the factions of the Democratic Party.

WALLACE: All right, let's turn to the elections that were held this last Tuesday night, which were very interesting, where Democrats took control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in a quarter century and also it appears, although the Republican governor of Kentucky still won't concede, it appears that the Democrats have won the governor's seat in Kentucky.

President Trump talked in Kentucky, campaigning for the Republican governor the night before. Here's what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: You've got to vote, because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: So, Karl, how worried should the president and Republicans be, not so much about those specific results and those specific races, but what you saw and you saw it in 2018 and you saw it again here, the suburbs. The suburbs in Virginia. The suburbs in Kentucky. The suburbs in Pennsylvania, around Philadelphia, this continuing move away from a Republican Party to the Democrats?

ROVE: Yes, and, look, all suburbs are not the same. You mentioned Kentucky. In Kentucky you had a very --

WALLACE: You brought your whiteboard?

ROVE: I brought the whiteboard for the first time appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”

In the governor's race, the Republican got 48.8 percent of the vote. Right below him on the ballot is a fresh first-time candidate, African-American Republican candidate for attorney general, who gets 57.8 percent of the vote and 75,000 votes ahead of the guy above him on the ballot, runs nine points ahead of him. The rest of the ticket for agriculture commissioner, auditor, secretary of state and treasurer --

WALLACE: My goodness, this is Kentucky. It's a pretty red state.

ROVE: I understand. I understand. But the point is, is that in the suburbs, those candidates run 11 to 12 points ahead of the Republican candidate for governor and for the first time in the modern era the Republicans take all those down ballot offices, which says, if you've got good candidates who make an appeal, they can carry the Republican suburbs.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: But, warning, negative, southeast Pennsylvania, Montgomery Bucks (ph), Delaware and Chester, Republican strongholds. The Democrats took Delaware County for the first time. The county council is 5-0 Democrat. First time they've had a majority on the county council since the civil war.

And then in Virginia, we've known about northern Virginia fading away from the Republicans. In this election it was the Richmond suburbs of Henrico (ph) and Chesterfields (ph). The Republicans have got a problem in the suburbs and Kentucky says if you right -- run the right kind of campaign and have the right kind of Democrat, you can win. But (INAUDIBLE) a problem.

WALLACE: I want to -- I want to bring Josh in.

There's the continuing fallout from Elizabeth Warren's continuing plans, spending, taxing trillions of dollars. And there was blowback this week from two relatively surprising sources. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: When you say I should pay a hundred billion, OK, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over.

JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: I don't like vilifying anybody. I -- you know, I think we should applaud successful people.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Josh, Bill Gates and Jamie Dimon, who's the CEO of JP Morgan, are certainly rich, but they are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination. What does that say to you? I mean, obviously, they're two billionaires who are -- I guess Dimon's not a billionaire, but two rich guys. What does that say to you about their problems that Elizabeth Warren will have with her tax and spend policies in a general election?

HOLMES: I think the best sign that Elizabeth Warren has a real problem with sort of your center left Democratic constituency is the fact that we started this segment talking about Michael Bloomberg. I mean Michael Bloomberg said back in February that as long as Joe Biden is in this race and feels like he's got a comfortable hold on the nomination, he's not interested in running. But if the Democratic Party looks like it's auguring towards nominating somebody who's in that sort of left wing, sort of more extreme category --

WALLACE: But we should point out Michael Bloomberg's another billionaire.

HOLMES: Sure. Absolutely.

But here's the -- here's the point. The point is, is that Joe -- this all says a lot more about Joe Biden then it says about anything else. Joe Biden is now in a place where he has lost his hold on the Democratic primary electorate and the Democratic primary electorate is looking for an Elizabeth Warren. That's what -- you know, with all due respect to Bill Gates --

WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) Elizabeth Warren or --

HOLMES: No, no, with all -- with all due respect to Bill Gates and all the other billionaires who have critiques about where the Democratic Party is, the Democratic primary electorate is saying loud and clear for anybody who will listen, we like Elizabeth Warren. We like Bernie Sanders. We have had five or six candidates try the center rode here and we have run them out of town in this -- in this primary electorate.

ELLEITHEE: You've got Biden and Buttigieg --

EDWARDS: Joe Biden --

ELLEITHEE: Are -- are doing about as well combined as Warren and Sanders are doing combined.

HOLMES: Well, he's -- look, he's lost --

ROVE: One's at seven and one's at 20.

ELLEITHEE: The moderates --

ROVE: And the other two are at 18 and 22.

ELLEITHEE: Not in Iowa. In Iowa those four are clustered very closely together.

Look, in 2018, more center left Democrats won congressional primaries than far left Democrats won congressional primaries with a primary (INAUDIBLE).

HOLMES: But it's not happening in the 2020 cycle. And I've got to tell you, people --

ROVE: There's a lot more far left Democrats won primaries in 2020 than won in 2018 or 2016.

ELLEITHEE: We'll see.

EDWARDS: This hasn't shaken out yet, so -- I mean it hasn't shaken out at all and everything's still (INAUDIBLE).

WALLACE: So the battle continues. Thank you all, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" the dedication it takes to escort the nation's bravest to their final resting place.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: On this Veterans Day weekend, we want to introduce you to a special military unit whose mission is to pay final tribute to the men and women who have defended our freedom. Here is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CAPTAIN ZACKARY STEELMAN, U.S. ARMY OLD GUARD CAISSON PLATOON: It's our honor to be able to provide them the best ceremony that they deserve and that their families deserve, to just pay it back to them the way that they've paid it to us.

WALLACE: Captain Zackary Steelman is talking about the Old Guard Caisson Platoon that bears the casket for military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery.

Two teams go out, one with white horses, one with black. Each participating in as many as four funerals a day. But the platoon is determined every one will be special.

STEELMAN: That family isn't going to get a second funeral. We have to put as much effort and time into making sure every detail of what we do is the best we can make it.

Do what you've got to do.

WALLACE: A squad is up at 4:30 each morning to make sure it's perfect. The horses are sprayed till they glean. The tack is shined. And so is the caisson that carried a canon back in the First World War.

Then, the horses are hitched up. The lead team that takes the caisson through the cemetery, the swing team that gets around tight corners, and the wheel team that acts as breaks. Then, they call out the mission.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Attention to orders! Zero nine, grant (ph) the 12 alpha, colonel, United States Air Force.

Swing?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lead?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wheel?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Caisson forward! Out (ph)!

WALLACE (on camera): Why do you have to do all of that?

STEELMAN: Well, it's not that we have to do any of those things, sir, it's really that we get to do those things. We're about to perform a funeral and we're about to perform the mission for that family and we want to make sure that we're doing it to the absolute best ability that we have for them.

WALLACE (voice over): The caisson platoon is part of presidential funerals. A riderless horse named Black Jack was in John Kennedy's procession. When he stepped on his handlers toe, the soldier kept marching.

In 2004, the military honors were for Ronald Reagan. The riderless horse was named Sergeant York, he is still part of the platoon.

STEELMAN: Sergeant York is the oldest horse that we have here in the barn. He's actually 29.

WALLACE (on camera): Twenty-nine?

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: Reagan used to say that there's nothing as good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse.

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: He would have loved this one.

WALLACE (voice over): Captain Steelman signed up for the Army's armor branch. When he joined the caisson platoon, he had never been on a horse. Now he thinks it's as important as any other mission.

WALLACE (on camera): How long do you want to keep being in the caisson platoon.

STEELMAN: If I could, sir, I'd be here for the rest of my life. I absolutely love this job.

I get to see soldiers every single day put in a lot of hard work for someone they really don't even know. I'm honored to be able to bring them to their final resting place. And it's just an honor to be a part of that specific mission.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Horses in the caisson platoon are put up for adoption after the service is complete. And right now Elvira, a member of the swing team for 16 years, is available. If you want to find out more, please go to our website, foxnewssunday.com.

And before we go, here's a live look at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Our colleagues at Fox NFL Sunday there for a special Veterans Day broadcast as a salute to the troops.

And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

The GOP witness list, obtained by Fox News earlier Saturday, included Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president Joe Biden, and the anonymous intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky triggered the impeachment inquiry.

""The committee ... will not facilitate efforts by President Trump and his allies in Congress to threaten, intimidate and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm,"" Schiff said in a letter to Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif. "" ... The whistleblower has a right under laws championed by this committee to remain anonymous and to be protected from harm.""

REPUBLICANS WANT HUNTER BIDEN, UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER AS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITNESSES

""The impeachment inquiry, moreover, has gathered an ever-growing body of evidence -- from witnesses and documents, including the president's own words in his July 25 call record -- that not only confirms but far exceeds the initial information in the whistleblower's complaint ... "" Schiff concluded his letter. ""In light of the president's threats, the individual's appearance before us would only place their personal safety at grave risk.""

Earlier in his letter, Schiff had warned Nunes that the impeachment inquiry and the House Intelligence Committee ""will not serve as vehicles"" for what he called ""sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit.""

The impeachment inquiry began when a whistleblower reported that Trump had pushed Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine— specifically, why former Vice President Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter held a lucrative role on the board, bringing in a reported $50,000 per month.

Republicans noted that testimony from former State Department official George Kent raised concerns about ""the appearance of a conflict of interest stemming from Mr. Biden's position on Burisma's board,"" and added that former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich was prepared by the Obama State Department to address questions about Mr. Biden's position on Burisma during her Senate confirmation process.

Republicans also planned to call the younger Biden's former long-time business partner, Devon Archer, who also sat on the board of Burisma. Republicans claim Archer can help the public to understand ""the nature and extent of Ukraine's pervasive corruption information that bears directly on President Trump's longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country.""

Schiff himself said in September the whistleblower would appear before Congress “very soon,” but in recent weeks has suggested that testimony is unnecessary.

""Because President Trump should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers, the anonymous whistleblower should testify,"" Nunes wrote in his letter to Schiff earlier Saturday. ""Moreover, given the multiple discrepancies between the whistleblower's complaint and the closed-door testimony of the witnesses, it is imperative that the American people hear definitively how the whistleblower developed his or her information, and who else the whistleblower may have fed the information he or she gathered and how that treatment of classified information may have led to the false narrative being perpetrated by the Democrats during this process.""

Republicans are also requesting that the ""more than half a dozen sources"" the whistleblower cited in their complaint to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, whose identities also remain anonymous, attend for a public deposition.

The list of witnesses also includes Nellie Ohr, a researcher at opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier; Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American consultant for the Democratic National Committee who allegedly met with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C. to discuss incriminating information about Trump campaign officials; ex-National Security Council official Tim Morrison; former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker; and high-ranking State Department official David Hale.

Earlier Saturday, the president again called the impeachment inquiry a “witch hunt” and said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Schiff and Biden should be added to the list of witnesses who would be called to testify.

""The witch hunt continues, lot of witch hunt continues,” he told reporters. ""The Republicans have never been so united and I think the people of our country have never been so united.”

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., insisting that their client is still ready, willing and able to cooperate with Republicans by providing written answers to questions — after GOP lawmakers scoffed at a prior offer to do so.

In a letter dated Nov. 6 and posted to Twitter late Sunday night, attorneys Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid cited an earlier communication from Zaid to Nunes on Nov. 2, which offered sworn statements from the whistleblower.

SEN RON JOHNSON: TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE MONEY BECAUSE OF COUNTRY’S MASSIVE CORRUPTION, NOT QUID PRO QUO

“So long as the questions do not seek identifying information, regarding which we will not provide, or are otherwise inappropriate, I will ensure you receive timely answers,” the letter, insisting that this offer “was specifically to ensure the Minority was not in any way shut out of the process.”

The Nov. 2 offer to provide written answers was swiftly rejected. House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, claimed in a statement that “written answers will not provide a sufficient opportunity to probe all the relevant facts and cross examine the so-called whistleblower.”

The whistleblower first alleged that President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky included pressure from Trump to have Zelensky assist in investigating his political opponents, including Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The complaint was based on secondhand information from officials who the whistleblower said listened to the call. A transcript of the conversation has since shown Trump did seek those investigations, though the president says the call was ""perfect"" and has rejected allegations that he used military aid as leverage.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITNESS LIST WIDENS PARTISAN RIFT, AS PUBLIC HEARINGS APPROACH

Since the complaint was filed, House Democrats have called several current and former officials before the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs Committees for closed-door interviews, with public hearings to begin this week.

""You don't get to ignite an impeachment effort and never account for your actions and role in orchestrating it,"" Jordan said.

The attorneys defended their client, indicating that the complaint was not part of a plan to impeach the president.

“As Mr. Zaid wrote to you, ‘Being a whistleblower is not a partisan job nor is impeachment an objective. That is not our role,’” the letter said.

The letter also defended reminded Nunes that he and Zaid worked on the same side in the past.

“You and Mr. Zaid have worked closely together on numerous matters, particularly when he was protecting the Benghazi whistleblowers, especially from perceived attacks from Democrats. You were their strongest and most devoted ally,” the letter said. “Based on both your many professional, as well as personal, interactions, we cannot fathom you agree with the assessment of your colleagues. We write today to assure you that were the Republicans to submit written questions to our client, we would absolutely follow through as promised.”

As the House prepares for public hearings to begin later this week, Republicans submitted a list of witnesses they would like to come forward. The whistleblower was among them, as the GOP's preference remains to have the whistleblower answer questions in person. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is leading the inquiry, rejected that request.

Republicans said they would agree to raise the federal debt limit, preventing a global crisis, but only if Democrats delayed implementation of the ACA, approved the Keystone XL pipeline, imposed Medicare means testing, made the Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory-reform law more Wall Street friendly, increased oil drilling, and ended the EPA’s efforts to combat the climate crisis.

Ezra Klein wrote at the time that the list showed the Republican-led House was no longer “a sane place.” Ezra added, “The House GOP’s debt limit bill … isn’t a serious governing document. It’s not even a plausible opening bid. It’s a cry for help.”

Six years later, Republican leaders have some ideas about the witnesses who should testify in the House impeachment inquiry as it advances to its next phase, which includes public hearings that begin this week. But reading the GOP’s witness list, it doesn’t strike me as a plausible opening bid – it seems more like a cry for help. The Washington Post reported over the weekend:

House Republicans on Saturday pressed ahead with their efforts to move the impeachment inquiry away from President Trump, calling on Democrats to add witnesses to the probe including former vice president Joe Biden’s son and the whistleblower whose initial complaint kicked off the investigation. […] The sprawling list of potential witnesses named by Republicans on Saturday … included Hunter Biden, whose father is a leading Democratic candidate to challenge Trump in 2020; Hunter Biden’s business partner Devon Archer; the unnamed whistleblower, who Trump and some of his allies have campaigned to publicly identify; the researcher Nellie Ohr of Fusion GPS, which commissioned a dossier linking Russia and Trump; and Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American who worked with the Democratic National Committee.

This is not a list compiled by officials who are serious about the inquiry.

Of course, as a procedural matter, House Republicans, from their minority perch, can’t simply call whatever witnesses they want. Rather, their wish list was turned over to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who soon after explained that the impeachment probe would not serve “to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference” that Trump asked Ukraine to conduct.

Or put another way, the Republicans’ requested witness list probably won’t be taken too seriously by the House majority. The interesting thing is to consider what happens after the document ends up in the circular file in Schiff’s office.

It’s not hard to imagine how the dominoes are likely to fall. Schiff will dismiss the House GOP’s witness list as ridiculous, at which point Republicans will (again) denounce the impeachment inquiry as unfair. They’ve already made these claims, of course, and they’ve been discredited, but the complaints have never been conveyed as an accurate point rooted in good faith. The GOP’s audience has been the electorate at large, which Republicans hope to sway through dubious process claims.

But that’s not the only intended audience. I also wonder whether Senate Republicans, who’d be responsible for holding the impeachment “trial” in the event the House approves articles, might use something like this as an excuse to short-circuit the proceedings.

Indeed, by some measure, it’s already begun. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), doing lasting harm to what’s left of his reputation, told Fox News yesterday the impeachment inquiry would be “invalid” unless the intelligence community’s whistleblower is exposed.

That’s bonkers, but it’s where the debate appears to be headed."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): “You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?”

In a new interview with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, made a related argument:

“I think the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why [do] we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?”

Those familiar with American Civics 101 probably realize the reason “a bunch of people in Congress” are working on an impeachment inquiry is because that’s how the process is supposed to work under the U.S. Constitution. What’s more, we have “a bunch of people in Congress” grappling with how to address presidential abuses because “the American people” decided to put the House of Representatives in the hands of a Democratic majority – made up of members who ran on a platform of holding Trump accountable.

I’m going to assume that Haley, a former top member of Donald Trump’s team, knows all of this. I’ll also assume that the point she intended to make was about delaying judgment on the president’s apparent misconduct until Election Day 2020. Indeed, the former South Carolina governor added on Twitter over the weekend, “This is a decision for the American people.”

It’s an increasingly popular pitch in GOP circles. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who’ll retire from elected office next year, recently argued, “An election, which is just around the corner, is the right way to decide who should be president.” Similarly, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, added yesterday, “Let the American people decide this in less than a year.”

At face value, this may seem like one of the GOP’s less ridiculous arguments. Trump was caught crossing the line, and if voters have a problem with the president’s abuses, they can vote for someone new next November. If, on the other hand, voters are unmoved, the electorate can make that clear, too.

There are, however, a couple of serious flaws with this.

NBC News’ First Read team published an item in September about the Ukraine scandal, just as it was starting to break, that stuck with me:

If this is what this looks like … then it’s arguably worse than Watergate, when the dirty tricks were being conducted by Americans against Americans. But this time, is the dirty trick a sitting president dangling aid to a foreign country to get it to investigate a rival campaign? We learned from 2016 that the Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. Do national Democrats – who believe defeating Trump in 2020, not impeaching him, is the best way to remove him from office – understand what else we might see over the next 14 months?

The Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. That, in a nutshell, is why the scandal can’t wait. One of the key pillars of the whole controversy has been a simple fact: Trump intended to cheat in the election by way of an extortion scheme. The president, rightly or wrongly, saw Joe Biden as a credible electoral threat, which led him to push a vulnerable foreign ally to cook up some dirt Republicans could use before Election Day.

To let this go unpunished is to effectively encourage the president who knows no limits, and believes there can be no checks on his misconduct, to keep exploring other cheating options.

The broader national goal should be to ensure that the United States has a free and fair election next year. Trump has already taken steps that are fundamentally at odds with that goal.

It’s not as if the president has rolled out some kind of “mea culpa” defense, acknowledging poor judgment, and assuring the public that he intends to stop trying to screw around with the 2020 cycle. On the contrary, Trump has done largely the opposite, insisting his actions were “perfect,” permissible, and literally unimpeachable.

As New York’s Jon Chait recently put it, “Using his foreign-policy authority to leverage dirt on Americans who oppose him is not a mistake, it is Trump’s ongoing campaign strategy. Either he will be removed from office over it, or he will use that strategy to try to win reelection.”

To ask “the American people” to decide the proper resolution is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months. Trump has already made it painfully obvious that he has a very different plan in mind."

Hunter Biden's financial involvement in the Ukraine gas company Burisma -- while his father was in office -- has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks since the House of Representatives formally launched the impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his conversation with the Ukrainian president about investigating the Bidens. With public impeachment hearings scheduled for this week, Republicans recently included Hunter Biden on a list of witnesses they wanted to hear under oath.

Appearing on a televised town hall Monday, the 2020 frontrunner doubled down on his claim that no wrongdoing took place while he was vice president.

""Every single, solitary, serious investigator... looked at this and said there's absolutely zero basis to the accusation that I acted inappropriately or that my son did,"" Biden told the Iowa audience. ""This is all about Trump trying to create a diversion... There's not a scintilla of evidence pointing out that anything is wrong.""

After calling Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani a ""chump,"" Biden dismissed Republicans' inclusion of his son on their testimony wish list.

""There is zero rationale for that to happen,"" Biden told CNN anchor Erin Burnett. ""Nobody has suggested that anything was done that was inappropriate. This is all a diversion. This is classic Trump, classic Trump. Focus on the problems. We have a president who is one of the most corrupt people to serve in that office.""

The former vice president continued, ""I released 21 years of my tax returns in detail. Mr. President, you're worried about corruption? Release some of yours!"""

According to an unsigned memo circulated internally among Trump campaign staff and exclusively obtained by Fox News, the Trump campaign argued that last week’s election results — specifically in Kentucky — were actually a “clear rejection of the brand of radical extremism that Democrats are espousing and that Joe Biden has embraced again and again on the campaign trail.”

“If [former Vice President Joe] Biden thinks he will be able to hide from his record — and his recent conversions to current Democrat dogma — he’s in over his head as the pundits think he is,” the memo read. “Joe Biden’s campaign has proven that there is no centrist lane in the Democrat presidential race.”

The Trump campaign’s memo rejected the notion that the Biden campaign would be able to win Southern states in the general election in 2020 -- should Biden ultimately become the Democratic presidential nominee.

“Biden has shifted to the radical left on every issue concerning swing voters,” the Trump campaign memo read, referring back to a statement Biden made on the campaign trail earlier this year.

JOE BIDEN PREDICTS REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE AN 'EPIPHANY' ONCE TRUMP LEAVES OFFICE

“I plan on, if I’m your nominee, winning Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, believe it or not,’” they quoted Biden as saying.

“We see no evidence to support this fantasy,” the campaign added.

The Biden campaign shot back in a statement to Fox News.

""When Donald Trump campaigned for Matt Bevin in a commonwealth he won by almost 30 points, he warned, 'They’re going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. ...You can’t let that happen to me.' Well, Kentucky made that happen,"" Biden campaign rapid response director Andrew Bates said. ""Bevin lost. Trump lost. The same outcome took place in Virginia and in 2018 when health care cost Republicans the House.""

Bates continued: ""This will continue as long as Donald Trump is still trying to take health coverage away from millions and end the ACA's life-saving protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. And Trump is so terrified of being called out for this moral failure that he tried to extort a foreign country into lying for him.""

""No one buys his MAGA-dreamland excuses,"" he said.

The Trump campaign memo appears to be a direct rebuttal to a Biden campaign internal memo, which was first reported by NBC News last week and obtained by Fox News on Monday. The Biden campaign’s memo touted the off-cycle wins and strategies in swing states as “the right formula with which Democrats can retake the White House from Donald Trump.”

The Biden campaign’s memo touted Virginia Democrats’ victory in capturing both chambers of the state legislature after the former vice president held a get-out-the-vote rally with former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

“And if this model succeeds in states as challenging for Democrats as Kentucky, it can absolutely gain us the necessary ground to re-take more competitive battleground states, and that is exactly what Joe Biden — more so than any other Democrat running –is poised to do,” it said.

The dueling memos were outlining two starkly different campaigns’ views on Democrats’ election victories in Kentucky and Virginia last week.

In Virginia, Democrats flipped both the state Senate and the House of Delegates, giving them control of both the governor’s office and the legislature for the first time in more than two decades.

Meanwhile, in Kentucky, Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin trailed Democratic rival Andy Beshear, who served as the state’s attorney general. Bevin has not yet conceded in the race, but Democrats have declared victory. Bevin argued that there were “significant irregularities” in the race, and called for a recanvassing, after results showed him approximately 5,000 votes behind Beshear. That recanvass will take place Thursday.

Nevertheless, the Biden campaign touted Beshear’s lead, noting in the memo that Democrats used the issue of health care to help them win.

“In Kentucky, a state Trump won by nearly 30 points, Andy Beshear outmaneuvered incumbent Republican Governor Matt Bevin, by calling-out Bevin’s undermining of the Commonwealth's Medicaid expansion that has gained thousands healthcare coverage and holding him accountable for the divisions he stoked as chief executive there,” the Biden memo read.

The Trump campaign, though, has instead painted Beshear as a “Trump-friendly moderate,” saying he distanced himself from impeachment “and took great pains to reach out to Trump-supporting conservatives in coal country and other parts of rural Kentucky.”

“[Beshear’s] campaign went so far as to run an ad with Trump voters: ‘I’m still a Donald Trump guy,’ one voter tells the camera. ‘Trump, 100 percent,’ says another,” the memo read.

“In contrast, Joe Biden has loudly called for President Trump’s impeachment and, like the rest of the 2020 Democrats, made it a centerpiece of his campaign,” the Trump campaign added. “He has slandered Trump voters like those featured in Beshear's ad as racists, embraced the job-killing Green New Deal, pledged to ‘shut down’ coal plants and end all fossil fuel development, ridiculed middle-class tax cuts, endorsed taxpayer-funded abortion, and close down detention facilities for illegal immigrants.”

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN LEADS NOMINATION RACE, TOPS TRUMP BY 12 POINTS IN MATCHUP

They added: “This is the ‘template’ Joe Biden is planning to run on in 2020 – and it won’t sell in Kentucky or elsewhere.”

The Trump campaign’s memo also touted other Republican victories in Kentucky, such as Daniel Cameron as the first African-American to be elected to be Kentucky’s attorney general. Further, Cameron will be the first Republican attorney general in the state in more than 70 years.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also touted Republican wins last week and said it signaled enthusiasm for Trump in 2020.

“While the mainstream media will continue to extrapolate an incoming blue wave based solely on one outlier race in Kentucky, the fact remains: this was a historic night of victories for Republicans and a great indication of what’s to come in 2020,” she wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. “Enthusiasm for President Trump and his policies continues to grow, and in less than one year we will once again witness a historic victory as President Trump is reelected and Republicans win up and down the ballot.”

Meanwhile, the latest Fox News poll reveals that in a head-to-head match-up, Biden leads Trump by 12 points with 51 percent of the vote over Trump’s 39 percent. In October, Biden led that same poll by 10 percent.

The survey – from Quinnipiac University – also suggested that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the top tier of contenders in New Hampshire.

According to the poll – which was released Monday – Biden stood at 20 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENITAL CAMPAIGN

Warren, who hailed from neighboring Massachusetts, had the backing of 16 percent, with Buttigieg at 15 percent. Sanders – who’s long lived in neighboring Vermont and who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – registered at 14 percent.

The survey showed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent. No other candidate in the large field of Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump topped 1 percent.

The Quinnipiac poll differed from a University of New Hampshire survey for CNN that was conducted in late October. Sanders topped that poll, at 21 percent, with Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Granite Staters traditionally have been known as late deciders, and with just under three months to go until New Hampshire’s February primary, that’s reflected in the new survey. Fourteen percent of those questioned said they were undecided, and nearly two-thirds of those who said they’re backing a candidate suggested they might change their mind before the primary day.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE JUMPS INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The poll was conducted as former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg started taking steps toward jumping into the presidential nomination race. Aides to the billionaire business mogul and environmental and gun control crusader said Friday that if Bloomberg were to run, he’d likely skip campaigning in New Hampshire and the three other early voting states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar.

According to the survey, only 2 percent said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg if he ran, with 37 percent saying they’d consider backing him. A majority – 54 percent – said they definitely would not vote for Bloomberg.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 6-10, with 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

Parnas' lawyer confirmed to Fox News that his client told Ukrainian officials that Vice President Mike Pence would not attend the swearing-in of the new president and the United States would freeze aid to the Eastern European nation if the demands were not met.

The claim by Parnas, who has been preparing to testify in the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry into President Trump, directly challenged the accounts by Trump and Ukrainian officials that have been at the heart of the congressional probe. Parnas’ claim also directly tied Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, to threats of retribution if Ukrainian officials did not comply with the demands – something Giuliani steadfastly has denied.

BUSINESSMEN PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO CONSPIRING WITH GIULIANI ASSOCIATES

Parnas’ story, however, has been contradicted by a number of people, including his business partner Igor Fruman, who also was present at a meeting with the Ukrainians and claimed neither the issue of foreign aid nor the vice president’s attendance at the inauguration was raised.

Both Parnas and Fruman pleaded not guilty two weeks ago to campaign-finance charges connected to political donations to a pro-Trump super PAC. They were accused of using a limited liability company, Global Energy Producers (GEP), to make donations in American elections to advance the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official.

Giuliani had hired Parnas and Furman to try persuading Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son Hunter for possible corruption. That relationship has now become another arm of the growing impeachment inquiry against Trump, as three House committees have been looking into whether Trump tried to persuade Zelensky to investigate the Bidens by withholding U.S. military aid during a July 25 phone call between the two leaders.

The first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry are scheduled to be held this Wednesday and Friday, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.

The first public hearing is to feature Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who already testified behind closed doors to congressional investigators that the president pushed Ukraine to investigate election interference, Biden and his son and their Ukraine dealings.

George Kent, the deputy assistant Secretary of State, is also scheduled to appear with Taylor. Kent testified behind closed doors last month; he told the committees he had concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian natural-gas firm Burisma Holdings in 2015 but was rebuffed by the former vice president’s staff, which said the office was preoccupied with Beau Biden’s cancer battle."

SWALWELL SAYS EVIDENCE IN IMPEACHMENT DEPOSITIONS AMOUNTS TO 'EXTORTION SCHEME' BY TRUMP ADMIN

Swalwell lambasted Republican calls for Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, to come before the House and testify during the public Trump impeachment inquiry hearings, saying, ""We’re not going to go back in time and revisit conspiracy theories that were implicated in the president’s call.”

Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky during his July 25 phone call to investigate Biden family dealings in Ukraine. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev.

Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.

WHY BIDEN EXCELS NATIONALLY, STRUGGLES IN EARLY STATES

Politico: “Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic race for president. Or he’s faltering, slipping into fourth place as he loses ground to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and an ascendant Pete Buttigieg. Those alternate realities are playing out in real time — reflected in Biden’s solid standing atop national polls versus his middling performance in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys on the other. The disparity is at once a source of frustration to Biden’s team and one of hope to rivals holding out for an utter collapse by the former vice president in the two earliest nominating states. The explanations for the discrepancy run the gamut. The white Iowa and New Hampshire electorates play against Biden’s strength among ideological moderates and African Americans, some defenders argue. Skeptics say it shows that the voters watching him most closely are underwhelmed. There's the fact that Biden pulled back on early state ad spending — both on TV and digitally — while competitors ramped up. Finally, the Trump factor: The president's reelection campaign has been running anti-Biden ads on TV in Iowa and more broadly over social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.”



Biden super PAC issues memo warning in early states - Politico: “A super PAC supporting Joe Biden warned Saturday that the Trump campaign is seeking to take down the former vice president in early state contests with a barrage of negative ads. ‘Trump is spending considerable sums in the early states, particularly Iowa, in a hope to stop Biden’s momentum before he can get to the states where his coalition works to his benefit,’ Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote in a memo obtained by POLITICO. … The memo from Unite the Country super PAC … lays out the candidate's consistent strength in national Democratic primary polls and in matchups with President Donald Trump in battleground states. It also points to Biden’s steady lead in South Carolina and Nevada, the latter two of the four early nominating state, which have a far more diverse electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire. Wins there would give Biden momentum heading into the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, the memo states.”



Klobuchar says a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make debate stage - Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn’t spare any punches on Sunday when going after fellow 2020 presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg – saying that a woman with the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s experience would not be on the debate stage. Klobcuhar, who has been polling in the middle of the still-crowded field of Democrats, argued during an appearance on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ that while every candidate in her party has been more qualified to lead the country than President Trump, she doubted a woman with the same resume as Buttigieg would be given a chance at running for president. ‘Of the women on the stage, I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sens. Harris and Warren and myself. Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,’ Klobuchar said in reference to Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.”



#YangGang: Now what? - NYT: “Enthusiasm for Mr. [Andrew] Yang is probably most palpable here in New Hampshire where the entrepreneur has repeatedly polled around 5 percent, his strongest showing in an early-voting state. … All of which leaves Mr. Yang and his senior campaign staff — some of whom, before this, had never run a campaign of any kind — with a new quandary: What do we do now? … But moving forward, Mr. Yang said he wants his message to become ‘more human-based’ — perhaps a necessary shift for a candidate seeking a broader audience who has thus far focused much of his attention on robots. His vision of a ‘human-based’ campaign, he said, involves talking more about the way he thinks his signature pitch can really change lives. … The strategic pivot — the most significant in the campaign to date — is most clearly exemplified by the new television ad Mr. Yang’s team put on the air Thursday in Iowa. They spent more than $1 million on the ad buy, the kind of seven-figure sum they did not have available to them for the long first few phases of his run.”



New venue chosen for December Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic presidential debate in December has been moved to Loyola Marymount University, after controversy over a labor fight upended plans to host the prime-time event at the University of California, Los Angeles. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour, the sponsors of the Dec. 19 debate, announced the change after the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that UCLA would no longer serve as the venue because of an ongoing dispute between the school and its largest employee union. … Six Democratic White House contenders have so far qualified to appear on stage: Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.”

“But all extremes are pernicious in various ways.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 35



TIME OUT: THE HISTORY OF VETERANS DAY

NYT: “On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect. ‘King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,’ The New York Times wrote in a front-page headline on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, the paper reported that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country. In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted the monumental changes that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. … In 1954, in response to calls for recognition of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978.”

REP. PETER KING ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

Fox News: “Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., the powerful 14-term congressman who once chaired the House Committee on Homeland Security, announced Monday he will not seek reelection in 2020. King, in a statement Monday, said his ‘prime reason’ for retiring ‘was that after 28 years of spending four days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford.’ ‘This was not an easy decision. But there is a season for everything and Rosemary and I decided that, especially since we are both in good health, it is time to have the flexibility to spend more time with our children and grandchildren,’ he said. … The 75-year-old congressman said his decades in Congress have been ‘an extraordinary experience.’ He currently serves as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, which he served as chair from 2005-2006 and again from 2011-2012… King is one of several Republicans — four senators and 17 other House members — who have announced plans to not seek reelection.”



Sessions’ feels support from 11 GOP senators in open letter - Politico: “Nearly a dozen of Jeff Sessions' former GOP Senate colleagues are backing his run for Senate, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. In an ‘open letter to conservatives’ on Sessions' candidacy for Alabama's Senate race next year, 11 Republican senators say that Sessions is a ‘man of his word. And we know he is devoted to serving the people of Alabama.’ … The letter is signed by GOP Sens. Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, John Boozman of Arkansas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Roberts, Enzi and Isakson are all retiring this year or next. Barrasso and Blunt are the Nos. 3 and 4 GOP leaders, respectively, in the Senate GOP.”



Steve Knight eyes old seat after Katie Hill resignation - Fox News: “The two-term Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Katie Hill announced on his website Sunday that he will attempt to win back his old seat. ‘I am proud to return to public service and deliver the type of representation our district deserves,’ Steve Knight posted on his website. Hill defeated Knight by 9 points in California’s 25th District in November. Hill-- a centrist-- was seen as a rising Democratic star because the district is seen as one of a few in the state that could be carried by a Republican. Henry Olsen, a columnist in the Washington Post, wrote a piece last month that questioned whether or not the state was ‘reopening’ the doors to Republicans. He pointed out that the district was a Republican stronghold before President Trump. He also called the election—which will likely occur on March 3, a possible bellwether for Republicans.”



Kentucky Republicans losing patience with Gov. Bevin - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “Republican Senate President Robert Stivers believes Gov. Matt Bevin should concede his loss to Democrat Andy Beshear if next week's recanvas doesn't significantly change the vote totals. ‘It’s time to call it quits and go home, say he had a good four years and congratulate Gov.-elect Beshear,’ Stivers said in a brief Friday interview at the Capitol. Bevin finished 5,189 votes behind Beshear in Tuesday's gubernatorial election but has refused to concede the race, requesting a recanvas of the vote that will take place Nov. 14. … Stivers said if Bevin chooses to contest the election by calling a special session of the General Assembly and making a case that there was illegal activity, lawmakers would have to hear the dispute under the state constitution.”



The political deadlock in states for 2020 - NYT: “Acrimonious deadlocks have become the new normal in Wisconsin, one of three Midwestern states where Democrats ended full Republican control last year by flipping governorships. Gov. Tony Evers’s defeat of Scott Walker, whose success at pushing Wisconsin sharply to the right prompted a brief presidential bid, has given Democrats a new foothold this year in a region where they had been mostly sidelined. Yet with attention turning to the presidential election, in which Wisconsin voters are seen as playing a decisive role, divided power has given way to frustrated impasse, with little chance for either party to hold up state policymaking as the showcase it once was here. … In Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, Democrats’ victories last November came after a period of extraordinary, sustained Republican success. Going into the 2018 election, Republicans controlled the governor’s offices and the full legislatures in 10 of 12 Midwestern states. … Though the purpling of Midwestern statehouses since last November has served as a check on Republican power, it has hardly led to a bonanza of liberal legislating.”



HOUSE GOP PREPARES FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Politico: “House Republicans are gearing up for a blockbuster showdown with Democrats as the impeachment probe enters its most visible phase yet, with GOP lawmakers and staffers from key committees plotting with leadership to launch their counterattack. To prepare for this week’s public hearings, Republican leaders have moved one of President Donald Trump’s fiercest Hill defenders to the House Intelligence Committee and have lined up an explosive witness list for the upcoming proceedings, offering some clues into their defense strategy. The transcripts released last week from closed-door interviews with impeachment witnesses also provide a window into how the GOP plans to approach the high-stakes hearings. Republicans will try to paint the Democratically led process as politically motivated and minimize Trump's role in the quest to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. And they will also try to keep the heat off Trump by attacking the Bidens and pushing other conspiracy theories about the elections.”



Mulvaney makes last-minute move to join impeachment testimony lawsuit - WaPo: “White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that could determine whether senior administration officials testify in the impeachment inquiry was an unwelcome surprise to former top national security aides, highlighting internal divisions among President Trump’s advisers in the face of the probe. Former national security adviser John Bolton’s advisers and allies were taken aback to learn late Friday that Mulvaney had gone to court seeking to join a separation-of-powers lawsuit filed against Trump and the House leadership, according to people familiar with their views, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry. The suit was filed by Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House, The Washingon Post previously reported.”

Leaders like Pelosi and Hoyer may try to parse words about impeachment, but we’re well past the point of no return now. Impeachment is now the political equivalent of the Popeye’s chicken sandwich. Nothing commands as much attention.”

NOT SO GOLDEN SPONGE CAKE

KARE11: “Every school has its tradition. One of the most unique ones belongs to a school in Maine that has run an ongoing experiment for 43 years: How long can a Twinkie survive? The experiment at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Maine, started in 1976. During a lesson about food additives and preservatives, science teacher Roger Bennatti was asked by a student how long a Twinkie would last. Bennatti didn't know. So, of course, he tested it. … More than 43 years later, the Twinkie is still at the school… That golden cake has darkened and greyed and the spongy holes are more prevalent. But it's mostly kept it's shape. ‘The Twinkie has become much like me. It's older, it's grayer and it's more flaky,’ said Bennatti, who is now retired. … So how has it lasted this long? The obvious answer is preservatives. But even with that, a Hostess spokesperson told Reuters the modern-day Twinkie has a shelf life of 65 days.”

Republicans signaled their intent to focus on the younger Biden when they sought him as a hearing witness in a letter sent over the weekend. Democrats are unlikely to approve the request, but his conduct may be an unavoidable topic in this week's hearings, given that witnesses' closed-door testimony to date has made clear some in the prior administration held concerns about his role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings.

REPUBLICANS WANT HUNTER BIDEN, UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER AS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITNESSES

Even without Hunter Biden in the hearing room, Republicans will be eager to publicly pry into those concerns, if only to offer justification for the act at the heart of the impeachment inquiry: Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden's role, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden's connection to the firing of a prosecutor looking into the firm's founder.

""I think this is absolutely worth looking into,"" Republican Rep. Michael Waltz, of Florida, said Sunday on Fox News' ""America's News HQ,"" regarding the Hunter Biden controversy. ""Yet the mainstream media and the Democrats just want to say 'nothing to see here'.""

One of the first impeachment witnesses, State Department official George Kent, could be pressed by Republicans about Hunter Biden's work. He is one of two witnesses scheduled for the first day of public hearings Wednesday.

Republicans are likely to zero in on his prior closed-door testimony, where he discussed his concerns about Biden’s work with Burisma, but said he was told it wasn’t appropriate to discuss the matter because of the health struggles of former Vice President Joe Biden’s eldest son, Beau, who died of brain cancer.

According to a transcript of his Oct. 15 deposition released last week, Kent said that in January or February 2015, he “became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board” of Burisma Holdings while his father was overseeing Ukraine policy as vice president to former President Barack Obama.

“I did not know that at the time,” Kent testified. “And when I was on a call with somebody on the vice president’s staff and I cannot recall who it was, just briefing on what was happening into Ukraine, I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back, and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest.”

After discussing those concerns with Biden’s staff, Kent testified that “the message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time.”

Kent also told congressional investigators that he had repeatedly raised concerns with the Obama administration about Burisma, and also discussed the administration’s efforts to remove Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin from his post. At the time, Shokin was investigating Mykola Zlochevsky, the former minister of ecology and natural resources of Ukraine— also the founder of Burisma.

Shokin was fired in April 2016, and his case was closed by the prosecutor who replaced him, Yuriy Lutsenko (though Ukraine is now reviewing such cases). Biden once famously boasted on camera that when he was vice president and leading the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin.

Biden allies, though, maintain that his intervention had nothing to do with his son, but rather was tied to corruption concerns.

Shokin was widely accused of corruption on both sides of the Atlantic. Biden has said that the international community was supportive in pushing for his firing. The former vice president has repeatedly defended himself and his son, saying that neither of them did anything wrong when it came to work in Ukraine.

""My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,"" Biden said during a Democratic primary debate in October. ""I carried out the policy of the United States government, which was to root out corruption in Ukraine and that's what we should be focusing on.""

He added: “Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven they are flat-out lying.""

Hunter Biden has also defended his role, saying he did nothing improper, while acknowledging that it was ""poor judgment"" to have joined Burisma's board.

“I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,” the younger Biden said last month.

The Biden family actions in Ukraine, along with a separate issue connected to 2016 election interference, were at the core of what Trump wanted investigated out of Kiev. Trump's now-famous July phone call in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch the investigations prompted a whistleblower complaint and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TOLD CONGRESS HE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS IN 2015 BUT WAS IGNORED

The whistleblower’s complaint also stated their concerns that Trump was soliciting a foreign power to influence the 2020 presidential election — a concern that U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor directly testified to last month.

Taylor, during his closed-door deposition, testified that he “understood that the reason for investigating Burisma was to cast Vice President Biden in a bad light.” Taylor added that it would benefit “a political campaign for the reelection of President Trump.”

Taylor is expected to testify with Kent on Wednesday as part of the first round of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, in a letter penned by Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., Republicans have also proposed Hunter Biden’s former longtime business partner, Devon Archer, as a witness, claiming he could help to understand “the nature and extent of Ukraine’s pervasive corruption” which could provide “information that bears directly on President Trump’s longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country.”

But according to formal rules for the impeachment inquiry passed last month, Democrats have final say over witnesses.

Even outside the impeachment inquiry process, GOP lawmakers are amplifying concerns over the younger Biden’s business dealings. Last week, Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, taking issue with Biden and Archer’s roles on the board of Burisma.

“Emails recently obtained and made public through a FOIA request indicate that Burisma’s consulting firm used Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board to gain access and potentially influence matters at the State Department,” they wrote, further requesting State Department information related to Biden and Archer’s work.

They cited a 2016 email, first reported by Fox News contributor John Solomon, from a State Department official describing a request for a meeting from a Burisma representative -- the request name-dropped Hunter Biden.

“She noted that two high-profile U.S. citizens are affiliated with the company (including Hunter Biden as a board member),"" the email said, saying the representative wanted to get ""a better understanding of how the U.S. came to the determination that the company is corrupt"" while arguing there was no evidence of corruption.

Meanwhile, on Friday former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee in public. Yovanovich has previously told congressional investigators as part of the probe that former Vice President Biden never ""raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden"" with her."

FLASHBACK: UKRAINE EMBASSY SAYS DNC OPERATIVE REACHED OUT FOR INFORMATION ON TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN 2016

Watters said Republicans put forward a serious witness list for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. -- but doubted Schiff would allow many of those individuals to testify.

He commended lawmakers for mentioning the name of Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic National Committee (DNC) contractor whom a Ukrainian embassy official had claimed reached out for dirt on then-candidate Trump in 2016.

Earlier this year, Ambassador Valeriy Chaly said Chalupa pushed for Ukraine's then-President Petro Poroshenko to mention Paul Manafort's ties to Ukraine publicly during a visit to the U.S., and sought detailed financial information on his dealings in the country, The Hill reported. At the time, Manafort was President Trump's campaign chairman.

On ""The Five,"" Watters added that Hunter Biden was key to the impeachment effort on both sides of the argument, though Democrats including Schiff have resisted calls for him to testify.

""I love how Hunter Biden is 'irrelevant.' Hunter Biden is at the center of this whole Venn diagram -- You take Hunter Biden out of here, there is no story,"" he added.

""So, of course they'll rig it and they won't let him testify.""

The ""Watters World"" host said that Trump ultimately provided Ukraine with the defense aid before the Sept. 30 deadline, and that Kiev never opened an investigation into Biden or his father -- the former vice president and current 2020 presidential contender.

The revelation, which came in a transcript of Cooper's closed-door Oct. 23 deposition released Monday by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry, prompted concerns from commentators that the most self-destructive elements of the Russia probe were resurfacing.

""Like Russiagate, Ukrainegate enrolls liberals in the Cold War designs of dangerous hawks and neocons,"" tweeted journalist Aaron Mate.

Additionally, Cooper testified that the Trump administration had pushed Ukraine to issue a public statement disavowing any efforts to influence U.S. elections -- but Cooper stopped short of saying that officials wanted to include a reference to Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country.

Previous testimony in the inquiry has suggested that the White House improperly pressured Ukraine to implicate the Bidens publicly. Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, for example, had remarked that European Union envoy Gordon Sondland and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani worked with a top Ukrainian aide to include a reference to the Biden-linked Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.

But, Cooper said that on Aug. 20, Volker met with her -- and the idea of mentioning the Bidens apparently didn't come up.

""In that meeting, he did mention something to me that, you know, was the first about, somehow, an effort that he was engaged in to see if there was a statement that the government of Ukraine would make that would somehow disavow any interference in U.S. elections and would commit to the prosecution of any individuals involved in election interference,"" Cooper said. ""And, that was about as specific as it got.""

Cooper's testimony was made public as House Democrats on Monday also released transcripts from their interviews with Christopher Anderson, a career foreign service officer at the State Department, and Catherine Croft, a Ukraine expert at the State Department. Croft testified that she speculated Trump would be willing to shift Ukraine policy to hurt a Biden candidacy, and that news of a holdup of Ukraine aid ""blew up"" a State Department meeting.

READ COOPER'S TESTIMONY TRANSCRIPT

Croft, in her remarks, said that the Office of Management and Budget had ""reported that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had placed an informal hold on security assistance to Ukraine. The only reason given was that it came at the direction of the president.""

Separately, Cooper testified about Defense Department concerns that Trump's temporary withholding of military aid to Ukraine may have been illegal.

""I'm not an expert on the law, but in that meeting immediately deputies began to raise concerns about how this could be done in a legal fashion because there was broad understanding in the meeting that the funding -- the State Department funding related to an earmark for Ukraine and that the DOD funding was specific to Ukraine security assistance,"" Cooper testified, concerning a July 23 meeting of national security officials. ""The comments in the room at the deputies' level reflected a sense that there was not an understanding of how this could legally play out, and at that meeting, the deputies agreed to look into the legalities and to look at what was possible.""

The legalities likely regarded the issue of ""impoundment"" – the requirement that the president either had to spend the money or ""impound"" it. The White House was coming up against an impoundment deadline when it released the funds for Ukraine.

Moreover, Cooper said, Defense Department officials were concerned that Trump's decision would weaken a ""strategic partner.""

""I mean, so DOD was concerned about the obligation of funds,"" she said. ""Policy, my team, we were also concerned about any signal that we would send to Ukraine about a wavering in our commitment. ... They are trying to negotiate a peace with Russia, and if they are seen as weak, and if they are seen to lack the backing of the United States for their Armed Forces, it makes it much more difficult for them to negotiate a peace on terms that are good for Ukraine.""

She added: ""My sense is that all of the senior leaders of the U.S. national security departments and agencies were all unified in their — in their view that this assistance was essential, and they were trying to find ways to engage the president on this.""

Croft, meanwhile, told House investigators, ""If this were public in Ukraine it would be seen as a reversal of our policy and would, just to say sort of candidly and colloquially, this would be a really big deal, it would be a really big deal in Ukraine, and an expression of declining U.S. support for Ukraine.""

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL FLAGGED HUNTER BIDEN'S 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST' IN UKRAINE, TESTIMONY SHOWS

Ukraine had satisfied all necessary benchmarks to obtain Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funding, Cooper told lawmakers. This past May, Cooper said, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood ""provided the certification to Congress, but that was after coordination with the State Department.""

Cooper also told investigators she could make a ""very strong inference"" that Ukraine was aware in August that the Trump administration was holding up the financial assistance, shortly before the aid was released in September. The Ukraine aid was suspended temporarily in August -- two weeks before the White House released it, Politico reported.

""It could have been my inference, yes, a very strong inference that there was some knowledge on the part of the Ukrainians,"" Cooper testified. She called the aid suspension, which came without an explanation to her knowledge, ""unusual.""

Military aid to Ukraine, Cooper further testified, was relevant to U.S. national-security interests.

DIPLOMAT TESTIFIES WHITE HOUSE USED MILITARY AID, TOP-LEVEL MEETING AS LEVERAGE TO GET CORRUPTION PROBES

""Ukraine, and also Georgia, are the two front-line states facing Russian aggression,"" Cooper said. ""In order to deter further Russian aggression, we need to be able to shore up these countries' abilities to defend themselves. That's, I think, pure and simple, the rationale behind our strategy of supporting these countries. It's in our interest to deter Russian aggression elsewhere around the world.""

Trump's suggested in his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the country investigate Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings there, after it emerged that Joe Biden, the former vice president and current 2020 presidential candidate, had pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor while Hunter Biden held a lucrative role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. Zelensky has said he felt no improper pressure during the call.

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., stands at 22 percent among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, according to the Monmouth University survey, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 13 percent.

Buttigieg’s 3-percentage-point advantage over Biden is within the poll’s margin of error, but represents a remarkable surge in recent months.

BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP-TIER OF CONTENDERS IN NEW POLL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Buttigieg has soared 14 points since Monmouth’s last survey in Iowa, which was conducted in August. Biden’s dropped 7 points, Warren’s edged down 2 points, and Sanders has jumped 5 points from the August survey.

The Monmouth survey, released on Tuesday, is the latest in Iowa to indicate Buttigieg has joined the top tier of candidates, at least in that state. A Quinnipiac University survey in Iowa released last week showed Warren at 20 percent, Buttigieg at 19 percent, Sanders at 17 percent and Biden at 15 percent.

Buttigieg, the longest of longshots for the nomination when he launched his campaign at the beginning of the year, first soared in the spring to middle-tier status. The U.S. Naval Reserve veteran who served in Afghanistan and who would be the first openly gay president if elected surged again over the past month to reach top-tier status.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats. While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucus-goers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group. He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar from neighboring Minnesota at 5 percent, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and billionaire businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 2 percent. The rest of the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registered at 1 percent or less. Support for Harris dropped by 9 points since the August poll, while the rest of the candidates stood within a point or two of their August standing.

The poll’s release comes as former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul Mike Bloomberg takes concrete steps toward launching a Democratic presidential campaign. The survey indicates that among Iowa Democrats, Bloomberg has a 17 percent favorable rating and 48 percent unfavorable rating.

“Reports suggest that Bloomberg will skip the February contests if he does get into the race. With dismal numbers like these, it’s easy to see why. But I really cannot imagine that Democrats in the Super Tuesday states would be significantly more receptive to him than Iowa voters,” Murray said.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Nov. 7-11, with 451 Iowa voters likely to take part in the state’s Democratic presidential caucuses questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

On ""The Five,"" Gutfeld said Tuesday the hearing will be less exciting than the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh because the context of a phone call -- in President Trump's case -- is much less emotionally evocative than allegations of sexual misconduct.

""So, the Democrats ... are going to do their best to draw out the emotion -- by using questions like 'Did you feel threatened?' 'How did it make you feel?',"" he said.

""It's going to basically be group therapy in which the shrink is going to be asking the children, 'How mean was your daddy,' and Trump being the daddy.""

SCHIFF SETS STAGE FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS, WARNS GOP ABOUT GOING AFTER BIDENS

Regarding comparisons between the Kavanaugh hearings and the Trump impeachment proceedings, Gutfeld disagreed with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh -- who predicted Wednesday's hearing will descend into ""a Kavanaugh-style debacle.""

""I don't think this is going to be like Kavanaugh at all,"" Gutfeld claimed.

""It's not going to be that interesting because it's about a phone call, it's about a president doing his job, and it's about opinions about whether it was appropriate or inappropriate. It's about opinions.""

During a CNN event, former Vice President Joe Biden also chimed in on the impeachment hearings, dismissing Republicans' claims he should be on Rep. Adam Schiff's, D-Calif., witness list.

""There is zero rationale for that to happen,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said at the Grinnell, Iowa, forum. ""This is all a diversion, this is classic 'Trump'.""

Republicans have been critical of Biden and his son Hunter, in regard to allegations of wrongdoing in Ukraine.

The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.

“The House’s inquiry into whether grounds exist for President Trump’s impeachment has been, and will continue to be, a sober and rigorous undertaking,” Schiff wrote to both Democrat and Republican members of the committee, vowing that the public hearings will adhere to House rules governing the impeachment process and that participants will be “treated fairly and with respect, mindful of the solemn and historic task before us.”

Welcome to the club. Bloomberg’s conclusion, although self-serving, reflects a general unease among many Democrats. Mere months ago, the party was celebrating a field of 25 candidates who comprised a Noah’s Ark of group identities, but the mood has changed dramatically.

After panderfest forums, boring speeches and inconclusive debates, many Dems now sound like Peggy Lee as they ask, “Is that all there is?”

While most remain wildly enthusiastic about defeating Trump, they are far from ready to unite behind a single candidate. Even worse, the ideological split in the party is so serious that it might not be healed before Election Day.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., defended President Trump against the latest batch of transcripts from House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, saying it's not surprising the Washington establishment has a problem with the president shaking things up.

""I think that time and again, you'll see the individuals testifying this coming week fit into the category of people who had a substantive policy disagreement with the administration, and the administration that they themselves were a part of. You see, time and again, people as a part of the diplomatic corps push back on any administration that comes in and tries to change things up,"" Gaetz said on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" Monday.

""President Trump has a different way of interacting with other countries. He has a different style.""

""And here, I think you see testimony consistent with what you'll hear from [ex-diplomats George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and William Taylor], and that is that they didn't agree with what the president was doing,"" Gaetz added. ""And, they think it's impeachable, whereas I think the country won't.""

Gaetz was reacting to Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper testifying that the Trump administration had pushed Ukraine to issue a public statement disavowing any efforts to influence U.S. elections -- but Cooper stopped short of saying that officials wanted to include a reference to Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country, according to a transcript of her closed-door Oct. 23 deposition released Monday by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry.

Gaetz also dismissed the accusation of bribery levied against the president in response to Fox News senior legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano's previous segment on the program.

""I would disagree that bribery would be applicable for this reason. For bribery to have been committed, you have to be asking someone to do something that they would not otherwise do with President Zelinsky, who ran an entire campaign on rooting out corruption,"" Gaetz said.

He added that it was ""justifiable then for the president to say, well, if you're looking under the hood... let's make sure that there weren't Americans or American administrations or Joe Biden linked to any of that corruption.""

On Veterans Day, several candidates rolled out proposals to meet the needs of America's 20 million former service members.

Trump, speaking in New York City's Veterans Day Parade, praised the strength of the U.S. military and the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying the nation's veterans ""risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives."" More than 100 protesters booed and held black balloons that read ""support our troops, impeach.""

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said female veterans and service members have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.

""I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,"" Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. His comments went a step beyond his 21-page wide-ranging plan released on Monday.

""The president has let veterans down,"" Buttigieg said.

Of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level roles, four have never been held by a woman: Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury and White House chief of staff. Buttigieg says he'd take a close look at appointing a female defense secretary as well.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would seek to build on substantial gains for vets that were started under the Obama-Biden administration, such as stemming homelessness and improving mental health care.

Biden said he would ""restore trust"" in the VA after failed leadership, putting in place at least one full-time women's primary care physician at each VA medical center to boost women's health care and provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury.

He said as president he would publish a comprehensive strategy to address veterans' suicide within his first 200 days in office and hire additional staff to ensure that in his first year of office wait times for vets at risk of suicide are reduce to zero.

""Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,"" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife Jill.

In a dig at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video on Monday highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.

Trump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program, ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by President Barack Obama. What Trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders.

That expanded program, one of Trump's signature accomplishments, seeks to steer more veterans over the next decade to private-sector doctors outside the VA.

Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who voted against Trump's plan, says the expanded program goes too far in its investments in the private sector, rather than core VA health care , which many veterans view as better suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Sanders joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.

Sanders said he would fill those vacancies in his first year as president and provide at least $62 billion in new funding to repair and modernize VA facilities to provide cutting-edge care.

""We will not dismantle or privatize the VA. We will expand and improve the VA,"" Sanders said Monday.

Buttigieg told the AP that he would look at rolling back some of the Trump administration's rules expanding Choice.

All the Democratic candidates who have articulated veterans' plans call for added funding and training for suicide prevention.

Currently, about 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.

Buttigieg, like Warren, would seek to improve responses to sexual assault in the military by shifting prosecution from military commanders to independent prosecutors. He also wants to put particular focus on stemming homelessness among women vets, many of whom may have experienced sexual trauma.

He pointed to his seven-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 and watching the impact a female general had ""culturally"" on the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.

""When a leadership body is more gender diverse, it makes better decisions. So I would absolutely be looking at that,"" Buttigieg told the AP. He's previously pledged to appoint women to at least 50% of his Cabinet positions.

While veterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.

Currently, about 10% of the nation's veterans are female. In the U.S. military forces, about 17% of those enlisted are women, up from about 2% in 1973."

""It is important to underscore that the House’s impeachment inquiry, and the Committee, will not serve as venues for any Member to further the same sham investigations into the Bidens or into debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake for his personal political benefit,"" Schiff, D-Calif., wrote as part of a memo and letter to colleagues on procedures for the open hearings.

HUNTER BIDEN COULD BE COLLATERAL DAMAGE AS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS BEGIN

Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up.

The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.

“The House’s inquiry into whether grounds exist for President Trump’s impeachment has been, and will continue to be, a sober and rigorous undertaking,” Schiff wrote to both Democrat and Republican members of the committee, vowing that the public hearings will adhere to House rules governing the impeachment process and that participants will be “treated fairly and with respect, mindful of the solemn and historic task before us.”

Schiff outlined some of the rules, including that members not assigned to the Intelligence Committee are not permitted to make statements or question witnesses, but are allowed to sit in the audience; there will be “equal time” for himself and Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., to make opening statements; and there will be five-minute questioning segments for both parties.

The formal rules approved by the House last month also gave Republicans the ability to subpoena witnesses -- they sent over an extensive list of requested witnesses over the weekend.

But the Democratic majority has the final say. And while Schiff said they are reviewing the Republicans' list, his statements Tuesday signaled he would not be inclined to entertain witnesses or questioning that would shift focus to anything other than the allegations against Trump.

ICIG COMPLAINT ALLEGES TRUMP-UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER MAY BE SOLICITING ILLICIT DONATIONS

Republicans, though, have shown an interest in digging deeper into allegations against the Bidens, which is what prompted Trump's request to Ukraine in the first place -- eventually triggering the impeachment probe.

In Trump's now-famous July phone call, he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch investigations concerning Hunter Biden's role on a Ukrainian natural gas firm's board and Joe Biden's role ousting a prosecutor looking into that firm. This prompted a whistleblower complaint and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

Over the weekend, Nunes, House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Michael McCaul, R-Texas, listed Hunter Biden as one of numerous witnesses they'd like to call for hearings. They also sought former Democratic National Committee consultant Alexandra Chalupa in connection to allegations of Ukraine election meddling.

In his memo, Schiff stated that the committee is “evaluating the Minority’s requested witnesses and will give due consideration to witnesses within the scope of the impeachment inquiry.”

Schiff said that the parameters of the investigation include questions about whether Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Biden family’s business dealings in Ukraine for “personal political interests;” whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to advance his own interests; and whether he and/or his administration sought to “obstruct, suppress or cover up information to conceal from the Congress and the American people.”

Schiff has already denied the Republicans’ proposal to have the whistleblower appear as a witness.

Meanwhile, on Monday, top Republicans on impeachment-related committees sent their own memo to fellow Republican members outlining their strategy.

Republicans said that the president had a “deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid"" due to the country's history of ""pervasive corruption,” while claiming that Ukrainian government officials meddled in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump."

Where to start?

“Anonymous” is a self-admitted coward. He, or she, apparently still works within the administration. A true patriot would resign and go public so their accusations could be tested. Writing a book like this while still on the public payroll is more than cowardly, it is also an attempt to disregard, disrespect and dishonor the people who voted for Donald Trump.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: THE 'WHISTLEBLOWER' AND THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE

Next comes the testimony starting Wednesday of carefully selected “witnesses” before Rep. Adam Schiff’s “intelligence” committee (now there’s a play on words). These testimonies are designed to advance the left’s narrative about Ukraine, but only the narrative that fits their agenda and not the one featuring a real quid pro quo involving then-Vice President Joe Biden and his overpaid son, who held a directorship with a Ukraine energy company while his father was vice president and involved in U.S. policy on Ukraine. At the time, the elder Biden urged Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, with the threat of withholding U.S. aid.

Having failed at other attempts to smear the president, this is the Democrat’s last gasp. They must know that even if they draw up dubious articles of impeachment, the Senate won’t vote to convict and remove Trump from office. This could create one of the biggest political backfires in history if the public perceives it as unfair and driven by bias, ignoring evidence that would be to the president’s benefit.

Take one example of many that unmask the objective of the anti-Trumpers, which has been obvious at least since the 2016 election.

The attorneys for the so-called “whistleblower,” the person who heard from someone who listened to the call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine, have numerous Twitter postings stating their intentions. Here are some of them taken directly from their tweets.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

From Mark S. Zaid: “#coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion #impeachment will follow ultimately.” This tweet was posted just after the president was sworn in and before he had done anything.

In the summer of 2017, Zaid tweeted “We will get rid of Trump” and “as one (coup) fails two more will take their place.” He repeats these sentiments and objectives over many months. Zaid also predicted CNN would be an ally in the pursuit of impeachment. Anyone examining that network’s “reporting” can attest to the accuracy of his prediction.

The other attorney for the whistleblower, Andrew Bakaj, also appears to be an anti-Trumper. He has tweeted that the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. That’s the standard (in) the 25th Amendment.”

All of this is the stuff of show trials and banana republics. The left does not have a single issue on which they can defeat the president, most especially when it comes to the economy and the lowest unemployment in nearly 50 years, and as Trump claims, “the highest stock market ever.”

If the public comes to see this as the partisan assault that it is and a power play to nullify the will of the voters who elected the president in 2016 — assuming they pay attention during the coming holidays — this could prove the greatest political disaster for them since Walter Mondale lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan in 1984.

And they will deserve it.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., insisting that their client is still ready, willing and able to cooperate with Republicans by providing written answers to questions — after GOP lawmakers scoffed at a prior offer to do so.

In a letter dated Nov. 6 and posted to Twitter late Sunday night, attorneys Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid cited an earlier communication from Zaid to Nunes on Nov. 2, which offered sworn statements from the whistleblower.

SEN RON JOHNSON: TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE MONEY BECAUSE OF COUNTRY’S MASSIVE CORRUPTION, NOT QUID PRO QUO

“So long as the questions do not seek identifying information, regarding which we will not provide, or are otherwise inappropriate, I will ensure you receive timely answers,” the letter, insisting that this offer “was specifically to ensure the Minority was not in any way shut out of the process.”

The Nov. 2 offer to provide written answers was swiftly rejected. House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, claimed in a statement that “written answers will not provide a sufficient opportunity to probe all the relevant facts and cross examine the so-called whistleblower.”

The whistleblower first alleged that President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky included pressure from Trump to have Zelensky assist in investigating his political opponents, including Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The complaint was based on secondhand information from officials who the whistleblower said listened to the call. A transcript of the conversation has since shown Trump did seek those investigations, though the president says the call was ""perfect"" and has rejected allegations that he used military aid as leverage.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITNESS LIST WIDENS PARTISAN RIFT, AS PUBLIC HEARINGS APPROACH

Since the complaint was filed, House Democrats have called several current and former officials before the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs Committees for closed-door interviews, with public hearings to begin this week.

""You don't get to ignite an impeachment effort and never account for your actions and role in orchestrating it,"" Jordan said.

The attorneys defended their client, indicating that the complaint was not part of a plan to impeach the president.

“As Mr. Zaid wrote to you, ‘Being a whistleblower is not a partisan job nor is impeachment an objective. That is not our role,’” the letter said.

The letter also defended reminded Nunes that he and Zaid worked on the same side in the past.

“You and Mr. Zaid have worked closely together on numerous matters, particularly when he was protecting the Benghazi whistleblowers, especially from perceived attacks from Democrats. You were their strongest and most devoted ally,” the letter said. “Based on both your many professional, as well as personal, interactions, we cannot fathom you agree with the assessment of your colleagues. We write today to assure you that were the Republicans to submit written questions to our client, we would absolutely follow through as promised.”

As the House prepares for public hearings to begin later this week, Republicans submitted a list of witnesses they would like to come forward. The whistleblower was among them, as the GOP's preference remains to have the whistleblower answer questions in person. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is leading the inquiry, rejected that request.

GOP ON DEFENSE AHEAD OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Fox News: “Three top Republicans serving on panels involved in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump penned a memo to GOP members on those committees outlining ‘key points of evidence’ from the closed-door inquiry ahead of public hearings slated to begin Wednesday. Addressed to the GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, the memo outlines arguments in defense of Trump. It makes the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They say Trump had a ‘deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid’ due to the country's history of ‘pervasive corruption’ since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The memo points out that both Trump and Zelensky have said they felt no pressure during the call. Another piece of evidence cited by the memo's authors is that Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump in an effort to sway the race in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a claim that Trump has made but has not been proven.”



Schiff warns GOP about going after Bidens - Fox News: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff set the stage for the first public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry by vowing to keep questions at Wednesday's lead-off session focused on the Ukraine controversy -- in an implicit shot at Republican members who have signaled an interest in turning the tables on Democrats as they defend President Trump. … Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up. The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.”



Mulvaney reverses course, will follow Trump’s order not to cooperate - WaPo: “On the eve of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, President Trump complained that Democrats are relying on ‘2nd and 3rd hand witnesses,’ while a memo by Republican staff previewed how they plan to defend him. … In morning tweets, Trump, meanwhile, said that both Bidens should be called as witnesses in the public hearings that begin Wednesday with testimony from two State Department officials. … Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney no longer plans to seek a judge’s ruling on whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry and will instead follow Trump’s order not to cooperate. In a court filing Tuesday, Mulvaney’s lawyer said Mulvaney is reversing course and would not file suit seeking a court opinion on whether he must comply with a House subpoena.”

TIME OUT: REVISITING A PIVOTAL WWII BATTLE

Smithsonian: “‘At the present time we have only enough water for two weeks. Please supply us immediately,’ read the message sent by American sailors stationed at Midway, a tiny atoll located roughly halfway between North America and Asia, on May 20, 1942. The plea for help, however, was a giant ruse; the base was not, in fact, low on supplies. When Tokyo Naval Intelligence intercepted the dispatch and relayed the news onward … their American counterparts finally confirmed what they had long suspected: Midway and ‘AF,’ cited by the Japanese as the target of a major upcoming military operation, were one and the same. This codebreaking operation afforded the United States a crucial advantage at what would be the Battle of Midway, a multi-day naval and aerial engagement fought between June 3 and 7, 1942. … Midway, a new movie from director Roland Emmerich … traces the trajectory of the early Pacific campaign from the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor to the Halsey-Doolittle Raid in April 1942, the Battle of the Coral Sea in May of that same year, and, finally, Midway itself.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO FIRST PLACE IN IOWA

Monmouth University: “South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the leaderboard in the third Monmouth University Poll of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Buttigieg’s gains since the summer have been across the board, with increasing support coming from nearly every demographic group. Regardless, less than one-third of likely caucusgoers say that they are firmly set on their choice of candidate and most would not be too disappointed if they had to switch their support. The poll also finds that Mike Bloomberg receives a chilly reception among Hawkeye State Democrats as he considers whether to make a late entry into the nomination contest. Four candidates are currently vying for the top spot in Iowa’s caucuses – Buttigieg (22%), Biden (19%), Warren (18%), and Sanders (13%). Compared to Monmouth’s August poll, Buttigieg has gained 14 points (up from 8%)…”



Sanders falls to fourth in Granite State - Quinnipiac University: “With less than 100 days to go, former Vice President Joe Biden has an edge in New Hampshire's Democratic primary for president, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Biden receives support from 20 percent of New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters, with Senator Elizabeth Warren getting 16 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg getting 15 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 14 percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard gets 6 percent, businessman Andrew Yang gets 4 percent, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent, and 14 percent of likely voters are undecided. Independent voters, known as ‘undeclared voters’ in New Hampshire, who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary are divided in their top choice. Biden receives 16 percent support among these voters, while Sanders and Buttigieg get 14 percent each, and Warren and Gabbard receive 10 percent each.”



Mark Sanford drops out of presidential race - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford dropped out of the race for president just moments ago, ending his protest bid 60 days after it began. In a noon press conference at the New Hampshire Statehouse, Sanford announced his long-shot run is ending after previously declaring he would spend most of November campaigning in the Granite State, site of the nation’s first primary. The move came after Sanford failed to collect much of a following, especially as President Donald Trump remains the favorite of most Republican voters nationally and while Washington is gearing up for impeachment hearings. Sanford said the impeachment inquiry surrounding the president had sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the 2020 debate. ‘You gotta be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ he said, adding he is suspending the campaign and will look for other ways to advance his stance against the deficit.”



Former governor of Massachusetts considering bid - NYT: “Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has told Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations, the latest evidence of how unsettled the party’s primary is less than three months before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats.”



Sen. Michael Bennet expanding campaign in N.H. - WMUR: “While another Democratic presidential candidate is cutting back her effort in New Hampshire and still another is pulling out of the state entirely, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is expanding his presence and making a bold commitment. The Bennet campaign currently has one New Hampshire office, in Manchester, and small number of staffers in the state. But that’s about to change. The Bennet campaign told WMUR on Monday that within the next several weeks, it will open three new offices, including a new office in Manchester, and is currently ‘aggressively hiring’ additional Granite State staffers. Bennet made a public commitment. ‘Spending time with New Hampshire voters has made me a better candidate,’ he said in a statement shared with WMUR.”



Milwaukee DNC replaces top fundraiser - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “There's been a quiet shakeup in the leadership of the fundraising team for next year's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Out as the Host Committee's fundraising director is Marcus Switzer, a 32-year-old Milwaukee native who served as deputy national fundraising director for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Switzer has returned to Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign team. Switzer held the post for about six months. Replacing him is Leah Israel, a 36-year-old Chicago native who worked as a fundraiser for U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat. … In her new post as fundraising director, Israel is taking on the daunting task of raising up to $70 million for next July's big event.”



SUPREME COURT DIVIDED OVER FUTURE OF DACA

Fox News: “The future of the DACA program for young illegal immigrants remained uncertain as the Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared to lack consensus on whether the Trump administration's plans to rescind legal protections for so-called Dreamers were proper. The cases were debated during 80 minutes of tense oral arguments. No side appeared to command a clear majority of justices over what has become a major test of executive power on the contentious issue of immigration reform. At issue is the Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It was created under executive order and gives about 700,000 people brought as children to the United States illegally --or on visas that later were overstayed -- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit. Hundreds of Dreamers and their supporters rallied outside the court. Members of Congress were among those watching the arguments inside.”



LA. GOVERNOR’S RACE SEES RECORD NUMBER IN EARLY VOTING

Monroe [La.] News Star: “Louisiana loves voting early with voters coming close to setting an all-time record last week for the Nov. 16 governor's election. In all, 489,654 cast early ballots for the Nov. 16 runoff between Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone in a race generally considered a tossup. That's 100,000 plus more ballots than were cast early for the Oct. 12 primary that whittled the field to Edwards and Rispone. ‘This is a sea change between what existed previously,’ said Pearson Cross, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette political science professor. ‘I think it's a good thing that spurs turnout.’ … Early voting isn't likely to hit 40% of the total for the Nov. 16 election, but it could account for a third or more of total votes cast. Trump will headline another rally at 7 p.m. Thursday at the CenturyLink Center in Bossier City.”



Widow Rep. Elijah Cummings announces campaign for husband's seat - Fox News: “The widow of late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said on Monday that she will launch a campaign to win her husband’s seat as representative of Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. Maryland Democratic Party Chairwoman Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, initially told The Baltimore Sun that she would formally announce her campaign on Tuesday, nearly a month after her husband died of cancer on Oct. 17 at age 68. … In her first televised interview since her husband’s death, Rockeymoore Cummings said on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show Monday evening that she and her husband decided about six months ago that she would be the best fit to carry on his legacy and vision for the Baltimore district.

AUDIBLE: ‘THE ENEMY WITHIN’

“Our politics are paralyzing the country. We practice suspicion or contempt where trust is needed, imposing a sentence of anger and loneliness on others and ourselves. We scorch our opponents with language that precludes compromise. We brush aside the possibility that a person with whom we disagree might be right. We talk about what divides us and seldom acknowledge what unites us. … Contending viewpoints and vocal dissent are inevitable, and not the issue. … What is dangerous is not that people have serious differences. It is the tone—the snarl, the scorn, the lacerating despair.” – Former Defense Secretary James Mattis in his piece “The Enemy Within,” published in the Atlantic.

MARATHON MAN

BBC: “A British man has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world. Nick Butter, 30, from Bristol, [England] has run 196 marathons in 196 countries after starting in Canada in January 2018 and finishing in Greece on Sunday. He was inspired to do it to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK after a friend was diagnosed with the disease. Mr. Butter said he was ‘overwhelmed’ to have finished, after he crossed the finishing line of the Athens marathon. He said he was ‘very tired’ after completing the challenge, which took 674 days and involved visiting an average of just over two countries a week. … He chose Athens for his final run due to it being ‘the home of the marathon.’ Mr. Butter, originally from Dorset, [England] crossed the line with his friend Kevin Webber, who has prostate cancer and who inspired him to take up the challenge.”

Here's who Democrats have to thank,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gregg-jarrett-trump-impeachment-inquiry-trouble-democrats,"The clown show known as an ""impeachment inquiry"" is getting more comical and hapless by the day.

Consider the latest remark from the circus master himself, California Rep. Adam Schiff, (think Bozo, not Pennywise). The Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee says he doesn’t want Republicans turning the impeachment proceedings into a “sham.” The hilarious irony is lost on no one. Schiff has already managed to accomplish it all on his own.

At first, Schiff wanted the faux “whistleblower” who triggered the impeachment farce to testify. Then, suddenly, he didn’t. What changed? In the interim, evidence emerged that Schiff and/or his staff colluded with the “whistleblower” before the complaint was ever filed and then lied about it, earning Schiff “Four Pinocchios” from The Washington Post.

GREGG JARRETT: WHISTLEBLOWER NOT ENTITLED TO ANONYMITY — HE'S AN INFORMANT ACTING AS A DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE

The chairman now wants to conceal his own role in engineering the pretext for impeachment and his subsequent deceit. This is why he has insisted that the “whistleblower” remain anonymous, despite no such right, guarantee, privilege, or entitlement written in the law, as I explained in an earlier column. Even though the undercover informant (reportedly working for the CIA) does not qualify for whistleblower status under the law as determined by the Department of Justice, any effort by Republicans to call him as a witness will be blocked by Schiff.

But Schiff’s machinations are more malevolent than masking the key witness. Those he will call to testify are already on record dishing up prodigious plates of multiple hearsay and rank speculation. It is obvious from the released transcripts of the heretofore “super top-secret” inquisition that none of them have any firsthand knowledge of a “quid pro quo” allegedly demanded by President Trump.

For example, Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine who will testify on Wednesday, told Schiff’s committee that it was his “understanding” there was a link between U.S. security assistance and an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden. How did Taylor arrive at his opinion? He heard it through discussions with other diplomats, although there is no indication that any of these individuals had direct knowledge of anything. The chain of hearsay went something like this: the European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland told National Security Council official Tim Morrison who, in turn, told Taylor that there was a purported ""quid pro quo.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

But wait. If Sondland was the original source, where did he get his information? He initially testified that in a brief phone conversation with Trump, the president explicitly told him, “I want nothing ... I want no quid pro quo.” Sondland added that he “never” thought there was a precondition on aid. Later, he revised his testimony to state, “I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.”

Ah, yes. He ""presumed."" Reliable witnesses do not assume or presume anything. If they do, it is nothing more than supposition that should be discarded like yesterday’s trash.

My favorite purveyor of assorted hearsay is another star witness for Schiff this Wednesday. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified that he “believed” there was a “quid pro quo” after speaking to Taylor who spoke to Morrison who heard it from Sondland who, as noted, “presumed” a precondition. This is conjecture built on triple hearsay. It is not evidence, it is junk. If this were a court of law, the presiding judge would instruct the jury to disregard such testimony and strike it from the record.

The Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee says he doesn’t want Republicans turning the impeachment proceedings into a “sham.” The hilarious irony is lost on no one. Adam Schiff has already managed to accomplish it all on his own.

Under cross-examination, these witnesses readily admitted they had no firsthand knowledge of the president’s intent during his telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They simply propagated and repeated rumors and innuendo in their diplomatic echo chamber. But that has not stopped Schiff from pretending that they are valued witnesses. With the chairman’s encouragement and guidance, they have offered their interpretations of the Trump-Zelensky conversation. It reminds me of Schiff’s own dramatic interpretation of the phone call, which was nothing more than an unconscionable fabrication designed to smear Trump.

A transcript of the real conversation is the best evidence of what actually occurred. Indeed, it is the only relevant and material evidence. Nowhere is there a demand, condition, or pressure for a “quid pro quo” that made an investigation of the Bidens contingent on U.S. military assistance. This is corroborated by Zelensky who is on record stating that there was no blackmail involved and no pressure applied. “Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said. “We had a great phone call,” he added. “It was normal.”

The Ukrainian government has confirmed that it was unaware that U.S. aid had been temporarily suspended until almost five weeks after the call with Trump. As noted in my previous column, it is impossible for there to be a “quid pro quo” when the recipient of the “quid” is oblivious to the existence of the ""quo.""

In the court of public opinion, Schiff increasingly reveals himself to be the court jester playing the fool. He presides over an investigatory charade that is anathema to fundamental fairness and due process.

If the inquiry was equitable, both sides would be able to call their own witnesses. Yet, the House of Representatives passed its impeachment measure giving Schiff the right to veto GOP witnesses. He has already made it clear that he will do so, rejecting a request that the faux “whistleblower” testify. It is clear that other witnesses, including Schiff and/or his staff, will also be rejected.

To his credit, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has made it clear that if the unidentified informant who precipitated the impeachment ""witch hunt"" is not allowed to testify in the House, “this thing is dead on arrival in the Senate.”

In truth, it was DOA the moment Schiff was put in charge of this clown show.

Hunter Biden's financial involvement in the Ukraine gas company Burisma -- while his father was in office -- has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks since the House of Representatives formally launched the impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his conversation with the Ukrainian president about investigating the Bidens. With public impeachment hearings scheduled for this week, Republicans recently included Hunter Biden on a list of witnesses they wanted to hear under oath.

Appearing on a televised town hall Monday, the 2020 frontrunner doubled down on his claim that no wrongdoing took place while he was vice president.

""Every single, solitary, serious investigator... looked at this and said there's absolutely zero basis to the accusation that I acted inappropriately or that my son did,"" Biden told the Iowa audience. ""This is all about Trump trying to create a diversion... There's not a scintilla of evidence pointing out that anything is wrong.""

After calling Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani a ""chump,"" Biden dismissed Republicans' inclusion of his son on their testimony wish list.

""There is zero rationale for that to happen,"" Biden told CNN anchor Erin Burnett. ""Nobody has suggested that anything was done that was inappropriate. This is all a diversion.

The survey – from Quinnipiac University – also suggested that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the top tier of contenders in New Hampshire.

According to the poll – which was released Monday – Biden stood at 20 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENITAL CAMPAIGN

Warren, who hailed from neighboring Massachusetts, had the backing of 16 percent, with Buttigieg at 15 percent. Sanders – who’s long lived in neighboring Vermont and who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – registered at 14 percent.

The survey showed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent. No other candidate in the large field of Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump topped 1 percent.

The Quinnipiac poll differed from a University of New Hampshire survey for CNN that was conducted in late October. Sanders topped that poll, at 21 percent, with Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Granite Staters traditionally have been known as late deciders, and with just under three months to go until New Hampshire’s February primary, that’s reflected in the new survey. Fourteen percent of those questioned said they were undecided, and nearly two-thirds of those who said they’re backing a candidate suggested they might change their mind before the primary day.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE JUMPS INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The poll was conducted as former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg started taking steps toward jumping into the presidential nomination race. Aides to the billionaire business mogul and environmental and gun control crusader said Friday that if Bloomberg were to run, he’d likely skip campaigning in New Hampshire and the three other early voting states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar.

According to the survey, only 2 percent said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg if he ran, with 37 percent saying they’d consider backing him. A majority – 54 percent – said they definitely would not vote for Bloomberg.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 6-10, with 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

HERE'S WHAT TO EXPECT DURING PUBLIC HEARING

Giuliani wrote that Trump’s call with Zelensky was “innocent” and “proper,” and Trump was simply asking him to investigate “allegations of corruption at the highest levels of both governments” when he suggested Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's activities in the country.

GIULIANI ASSOCIATE TOLD UKRAINIANS TO INVESTIGATE BIDENS, LAWYER SAYS

He said the push for Zelensky to investigate was simply an “exercise of Mr. Trump’s responsibility as U.S. president.”

Giuliani wrote that Trump and Zelensky discussed alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, including documents related to Paul Manafort released by a Ukrainian lawmaker and the National Anti-Corruption Bureau that were purportedly meant to hurt Trump’s candidacy.

He added that Trump “briefly” brought up the Bidens’ conduct regarding the Ukrainian oil company Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board, and said he thinks the former vice president should be investigated for bribery over allegations of a $900,000 transfer from Burisma to a lobbying firm owned by Hunter Biden “and at the very least both Bidens’ behavior deserves serious scrutiny.”

Giuliani said Trump’s words during the phone call were free of “threat or coercion” and noted that Zelensky said publicly that he didn’t feel any pressure to investigate the Bidens.

“[O]ut of a five-page transcript Mr. Trump spent only six lines on Joe Biden,” Giuliani added.

He wrote that the left’s inability to accept Trump's 2016 win and ""fear"" of his policies have pushed Democrats into a “frenzy” and the ""double standard"" of the impeachment inquiry.

“[I]f the allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden aren’t fully investigated, we won’t have equal justice under the law,” Giuliani concluded.

Graham told ""Hannity"" on Tuesday the allegation President Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukrainian officials is also not true.

""I think it would be a danger to the presidency in the future for us to legitimize what's going on in the House,"" he said.

""There's no civil proceeding in America -- no criminal proceeding in America -- that denies a person to tell their side of the story by calling witnesses except in the House.""

HISTORIC TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS SET TO BEGIN AS DEMS PREDICT 'PHENOMENAL WEEK'

Graham was referring to the situation that, to-date, has not allowed Trump or members of his administration to engage in proceedings. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has also not yet approved Republicans' request to have the whistleblower testify publicly.

Speaking with Sean Hannity, Graham said every American -- including the president of the United States -- has the right to confront their accuser.

""That's not being done in this case, so I don't want to legitimize this because it's a threat to the presidency,"" he said.

He added he did not believe there was evidence confirming allegations lodged against Trump relating to Ukraine.

""The allegation is that Donald J. Trump withheld aid to Ukraine unless the Ukrainian government investigated Joe Biden and Hunter Biden for corruption,"" he said.

""The problem with that allegation is that it's not true. The aid was delivered to the Ukrainian government and there was no investigation of Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.""

In addition, Graham remarked that the Trump proceedings are not the first impeachment investigation he's been a part of.

In the late 1990s while serving as a U.S. congressman from Upstate South Carolina, Graham was involved in House proceedings against then-President Bill Clinton.

""Yeah, I've done this before,"" he remarked."

“There is nothing here,” Gingrich told “Fox & Friends,"" referring to alleged evidence of wrongdoing by Trump in his phone call with the president of Ukraine.

“Presidents who want to find the truth have every right to say to a foreign government, 'will you help me get to the truth,' and that’s what Trump was doing,” Gingrich said, referencing Trump’s call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for help investigating the Biden family's dealings in Ukraine.

Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father Joe Biden was serving as vice president and leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev.

'SHOW HIM THE TAPE': HUCKABEE BLASTS SWALWELL FOR CLAIMING BIDEN ALLEGATIONS ARE 'CONSPIRACY THEORIES'

Gingrich's comments came after Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation"" Sunday, said that the evidence he has seen from the depositions given in the House impeachment inquiry amounts to an “extortion scheme” by the White House.

Furthermore, on Saturday, MSNBC's weekend host Joy Reid told her viewers on ""AM Joy"" not to ""worry about trying to explain the cast of characters... or the very overused term, 'quid pro quo.'""

""Most people can’t say it, spell it or understand it,"" Reid continued. ""What we’re actually talking about here is not a pithy Latin phrase. It’s something a lot simpler: bribery and extortion.""

Gingrich reacted to the media coverage saying, “What you have is a coup being orchestrated by left-wingers in the bureaucracy, left-wingers in the news media and left-wingers in the House Democrats, and, historically, it’ll be seen someday as being crazy, literally like the Salem witch trial.""

He said mainstream media figures and Democrats appear to have coordinated on changing their allegations against Trump from a ""quid pro quo"" to ""extortion."" Democrats have accused Trump of withholding military aid to Ukraine unless the investigation of the Bidens took place.

Jordan chides diplomat on quid pro quo claims: ‘Your clear understanding was obviously wrong’,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jordan-diplomat-clear-understanding,"Republican Rep. Jim Jordan led some of the toughest questioning during Wednesday's impeachment hearing, challenging Ukraine ambassador William Taylor over his claims that he understood President Trump to be holding up aid and more as he sought to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce a Biden-related probe.

Taylor has said he had a ""clear"" understanding that the release of aid to Ukraine was linked to a request for investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company that counted the younger Biden as a board member. Jordan brought up three meetings that Taylor had with Zelensky between the time the aid was delayed and eventually released, and Taylor confirmed that ""there was not discussion of linkage"" during any of them.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HEARINGS BEGIN: LIVE BLOG

""Now, with all due respect, Ambassador, your clear understanding was obviously wrong,"" Jordan said, noting that Zelensky also never made any announcement of an investigation prior to Trump releasing the aid on Sept. 11, 2019.

Taylor then gave a further explanation of what his ""clear understanding"" was based on.

""As I testified, Mr. Jordan, this came from Ambassador [Gordon] Sondland,” Taylor said, recalling that Sondland told him that he said to Zelensky, ""that while this was not a quid pro quo, if Mr. Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate.”

Taylor also referred to how Sondland ""told me that it was a mistake to have told the Ukrainians that only the meeting with the president in the Oval Office was held up in order to get these investigations. No, it was not just the meeting, it was also the security assistance.""

Jordan, who was only recently added to the House Intelligence Committee that is holding the hearing, pointed to an addendum to Sondland's closed-door testimony, in which he discussed how Taylor recalled that he mentioned a linkage between the investigation and the release of aid to Ukraine.

""Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I had conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky,"" Jordan read out loud from Sondland's statement.

“We got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding,” Jordan said. ""And you're their star witness.""

Trump campaign press secretary Kayleigh McEnany seized on the moment, using it to argue against Taylor's understanding of social media.

Sondland responded ""that I don’t consider myself a star witness or anything,"" and that ""my understanding is only coming from people that I talked to.""

He explained that the confusing nature of Sondland's clarification was ""because he said he didn't remember this,"" but Taylor believes that Sondland's recollection is similar to his own.

""The way I read this, he remembers it the same way I do,"" Taylor said."

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., stands at 22 percent among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, according to the Monmouth University survey, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 13 percent.

Buttigieg’s 3-percentage-point advantage over Biden is within the poll’s margin of error, but represents a remarkable surge in recent months.

BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP-TIER OF CONTENDERS IN NEW POLL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Buttigieg has soared 14 points since Monmouth’s last survey in Iowa, which was conducted in August. Biden’s dropped 7 points, Warren’s edged down 2 points, and Sanders has jumped 5 points from the August survey.

The Monmouth survey, released on Tuesday, is the latest in Iowa to indicate Buttigieg has joined the top tier of candidates, at least in that state. A Quinnipiac University survey in Iowa released last week showed Warren at 20 percent, Buttigieg at 19 percent, Sanders at 17 percent and Biden at 15 percent.

Buttigieg, the longest of longshots for the nomination when he launched his campaign at the beginning of the year, first soared in the spring to middle-tier status. The U.S. Naval Reserve veteran who served in Afghanistan and who would be the first openly gay president if elected surged again over the past month to reach top-tier status.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats. While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucus-goers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group. He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar from neighboring Minnesota at 5 percent, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and billionaire businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 2 percent. The rest of the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registered at 1 percent or less. Support for Harris dropped by 9 points since the August poll, while the rest of the candidates stood within a point or two of their August standing.

The poll’s release comes as former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul Mike Bloomberg takes concrete steps toward launching a Democratic presidential campaign. The survey indicates that among Iowa Democrats, Bloomberg has a 17 percent favorable rating and 48 percent unfavorable rating.

“Reports suggest that Bloomberg will skip the February contests if he does get into the race. With dismal numbers like these, it’s easy to see why. But I really cannot imagine that Democrats in the Super Tuesday states would be significantly more receptive to him than Iowa voters,” Murray said.

On ""The Five,"" Gutfeld said Tuesday the hearing will be less exciting than the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh because the context of a phone call -- in President Trump's case -- is much less emotionally evocative than allegations of sexual misconduct.

""So, the Democrats ... are going to do their best to draw out the emotion -- by using questions like 'Did you feel threatened?' 'How did it make you feel?',"" he said.

""It's going to basically be group therapy in which the shrink is going to be asking the children, 'How mean was your daddy,' and Trump being the daddy.""

SCHIFF SETS STAGE FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS, WARNS GOP ABOUT GOING AFTER BIDENS

Regarding comparisons between the Kavanaugh hearings and the Trump impeachment proceedings, Gutfeld disagreed with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh -- who predicted Wednesday's hearing will descend into ""a Kavanaugh-style debacle.""

""I don't think this is going to be like Kavanaugh at all,"" Gutfeld claimed.

""It's not going to be that interesting because it's about a phone call, it's about a president doing his job, and it's about opinions about whether it was appropriate or inappropriate. It's about opinions.""

During a CNN event, former Vice President Joe Biden also chimed in on the impeachment hearings, dismissing Republicans' claims he should be on Rep. Adam Schiff's, D-Calif., witness list.

""There is zero rationale for that to happen,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said at the Grinnell, Iowa, forum. ""This is all a diversion, this is classic 'Trump'.""

Republicans have been critical of Biden and his son Hunter, in regard to allegations of wrongdoing in Ukraine.

""I think that time and again, you'll see the individuals testifying this coming week fit into the category of people who had a substantive policy disagreement with the administration, and the administration that they themselves were a part of. You see, time and again, people as a part of the diplomatic corps push back on any administration that comes in and tries to change things up,"" Gaetz said on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" Monday.

""President Trump has a different way of interacting with other countries. He has a different style.""

""And here, I think you see testimony consistent with what you'll hear from [ex-diplomats George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and William Taylor], and that is that they didn't agree with what the president was doing,"" Gaetz added. ""And, they think it's impeachable, whereas I think the country won't.""

Gaetz was reacting to Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper testifying that the Trump administration had pushed Ukraine to issue a public statement disavowing any efforts to influence U.S. elections -- but Cooper stopped short of saying that officials wanted to include a reference to Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country, according to a transcript of her closed-door Oct. 23 deposition released Monday by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry.

Gaetz also dismissed the accusation of bribery levied against the president in response to Fox News senior legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano's previous segment on the program.

""I would disagree that bribery would be applicable for this reason. For bribery to have been committed, you have to be asking someone to do something that they would not otherwise do with President Zelinsky, who ran an entire campaign on rooting out corruption,"" Gaetz said.

He added that it was ""justifiable then for the president to say, well, if you're looking under the hood... let's make sure that there weren't Americans or American administrations or Joe Biden linked to any of that corruption.""

""It is important to underscore that the House’s impeachment inquiry, and the Committee, will not serve as venues for any Member to further the same sham investigations into the Bidens or into debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake for his personal political benefit,"" Schiff, D-Calif., wrote as part of a memo and letter to colleagues on procedures for the open hearings.

HUNTER BIDEN COULD BE COLLATERAL DAMAGE AS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS BEGIN

Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up.

The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.

“The House’s inquiry into whether grounds exist for President Trump’s impeachment has been, and will continue to be, a sober and rigorous undertaking,” Schiff wrote to both Democrat and Republican members of the committee, vowing that the public hearings will adhere to House rules governing the impeachment process and that participants will be “treated fairly and with respect, mindful of the solemn and historic task before us.”

Schiff outlined some of the rules, including that members not assigned to the Intelligence Committee are not permitted to make statements or question witnesses, but are allowed to sit in the audience; there will be “equal time” for himself and Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., to make opening statements; and there will be five-minute questioning segments for both parties.

The formal rules approved by the House last month also gave Republicans the ability to subpoena witnesses -- they sent over an extensive list of requested witnesses over the weekend.

But the Democratic majority has the final say. And while Schiff said they are reviewing the Republicans' list, his statements Tuesday signaled he would not be inclined to entertain witnesses or questioning that would shift focus to anything other than the allegations against Trump.

ICIG COMPLAINT ALLEGES TRUMP-UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER MAY BE SOLICITING ILLICIT DONATIONS

Republicans, though, have shown an interest in digging deeper into allegations against the Bidens, which is what prompted Trump's request to Ukraine in the first place -- eventually triggering the impeachment probe.

In Trump's now-famous July phone call, he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch investigations concerning Hunter Biden's role on a Ukrainian natural gas firm's board and Joe Biden's role ousting a prosecutor looking into that firm. This prompted a whistleblower complaint and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

Over the weekend, Nunes, House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Michael McCaul, R-Texas, listed Hunter Biden as one of numerous witnesses they'd like to call for hearings. They also sought former Democratic National Committee consultant Alexandra Chalupa in connection to allegations of Ukraine election meddling.

In his memo, Schiff stated that the committee is “evaluating the Minority’s requested witnesses and will give due consideration to witnesses within the scope of the impeachment inquiry.”

Schiff said that the parameters of the investigation include questions about whether Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Biden family’s business dealings in Ukraine for “personal political interests;” whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to advance his own interests; and whether he and/or his administration sought to “obstruct, suppress or cover up information to conceal from the Congress and the American people.”

Schiff has already denied the Republicans’ proposal to have the whistleblower appear as a witness.

Meanwhile, on Monday, top Republicans on impeachment-related committees sent their own memo to fellow Republican members outlining their strategy.

Republicans said that the president had a “deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid"" due to the country's history of ""pervasive corruption,” while claiming that Ukrainian government officials meddled in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump."

For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. And he released a video declaring: ""They're trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you. And I'll never let that happen.""

Fireworks sparked from the very opening of the hearing, as GOP Rep. Devin Nunes accused Democrats of running a ""scorched earth war"" against the president. Republicans also ripped into Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., after the Democrat interrupted GOP questioning to say a witness should be ""cautious"" about answering questions that assume facts not in evidence before him.

But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.

THE IMPEACHMENT HEARING WITNESSES: WHO IS BILL TAYLOR?

Notably, Taylor testified, for the first time, that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about “the investigations,” to which Sondland responded that “the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.”

Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine.

“Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,” Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. “At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.”

This conversation would have taken place a day after the now-famous phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he sought a probe into alleged Ukraine interference in the 2016 election and of Joe Biden's role in ousting a prosecutor who had been looking into Burisma, where son Hunter Biden had a lucrative role on the board. Taylor made clear it was his understanding the term ""investigations"" indeed referred to the Biden family and Burisma. Trump is accused of not only pressing Kiev to look into those issues, but potentially linking that request to U.S. military aid for Ukraine, something Trump denies.

Taylor's testimony would offer another account linking Trump to the pursuit of those probes, and to Giuliani's controversial involvement abroad. Taylor also repeated his prior closed-door testimony that he understood critical U.S. aid was being held up, along with a Zelensky White House meeting, over the investigation issue. However, the newly revealed phone call did not by itself address any quid pro quo.

THE IMPEACHMENT HEARING WITNESSES: WHO IS GEORGE KENT?

""The security assistance—not just the White House meeting—was conditioned on the investigations,"" he said he was told.

Republicans sought to undercut the Democratic case by saying the Ukraine aid was ultimately released without any of the investigations sought by Trump, arguing that shows no quid pro quo took place.

Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan referenced three separate meetings Ukraine’s president held with U.S. officials, saying there’s no evidence participants discussed the “linkage” of security assistance dollars in return for an investigation of the Bidens. Taylor confirmed that’s the case.

Jordan also got Taylor to acknowledge he’s never met Trump and stressed that Zelensky did not announce the investigations, saying, “Your clear understanding was obviously wrong, because it didn’t happen.”

Republicans were quick to point out that Taylor was not providing first-hand information. At one point, Taylor said, “I don’t know what President or candidate Trump was thinking about the Ukrainians.”

During one combative exchange, Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe asked the diplomats if they believe Trump committed an impeachable offense. Neither would say. “That’s not what either of us are here to do,"" Taylor said. ""This is your job.”

The White House further argued that Taylor offered ""hearsay of hearsay"" and accused House Democrats of basing ""this entire sham on what amounts to a game of telephone.""

Republicans also lamented that Democrats aren’t allowing the anonymous whistleblower who filed the complaint that ignited the inquiry to testify, with Jordan saying they should have ""the person who started it."" A Democrat on the committee, Vermont Rep. Peter Welch, shot back: ""I'd like to see the person who started it come testify: President Trump.""

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., also asked both men if they are ""Never Trumpers"" as Trump has claimed. Both men denied it.

Meanwhile, during Kent’s testimony, he clarified that while he had raised concerns of a conflict of interest over Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings during February 2015, he did not see any effort from U.S. officials to protect that firm from criticism or investigation.

“My concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent said during questioning from Republicans. Kent also said he would like to see Ukraine investigate other accusations involving a corrupt prosecutor and Burisma.

Both officials voiced concerns about the involvement of Giuliani. Kent alleged he was trying to ""gin up politically motivated investigations."" Taylor said Giuliani and others were involved in a ""highly irregular"" diplomatic channel in Ukraine that eventually diverged with the more formal channel.

Meanwhile, Schiff outlined the parameters of the impeachment inquiry, questioning whether the president sought to condition official acts and “exploit” Ukraine’s “vulnerability” for personal political gain.

“The matter is as simple and as terrible as that,” Schiff said Wednesday. “Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief.”

Schiff described the core of the impeachment inquiry, and said: “If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?”

But committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., staunchly defended the president and his actions, blasting Democrats for their “scorched earth war against President Trump” and calling the impeachment inquiry a “carefully orchestrated media smear campaign.”

Prior to Schiff swearing in the witnesses, Republicans including Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Jordan challenged Schiff to schedule a hearing with the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry. They also accused Schiff of being the only member of the House, along with his staff, to know the identity of the whistleblower.

Schiff fired back, saying that he does not know the identity of that individual -- though his staff has had contact with the whistleblower.

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, meanwhile, blasted the hearing as a ""sham"" and ""colossal waste of taxpayer time & money.""

For the Democrats, Daniel Goldman and Daniel Noble, both counsels for the Intelligence Committee, were tapped to handle portions of questioning. On the Republican side, Steve Castor, whom Jordan brought over from the Oversight Committee, will be the counsel to pose questions for the minority.

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelensky. That phone call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

Zelensky, though, has said he felt no pressure during the call. The White House has maintained no wrongdoing, with the president calling the call “perfect” and arguing that it contained “no quid pro quo.”

The whistleblower’s complaint also stated their concerns that Trump was soliciting a foreign power to influence the 2020 presidential election – a concern that Taylor directly testified to privately last month.

Taylor, during his closed-door deposition, testified that he “understood that the reason for investigating Burisma was to cast Vice President Biden in a bad light.” Taylor added that it would benefit “a political campaign for the reelection of President Trump.”

Meanwhile, Schiff has already teed up three days of additional public hearings next week which, among other witnesses, includes three sought by Republicans—ex-National Security Council official Tim Morrison, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, and high-ranking State Department official David Hale.

Republican lawmakers have sought a slew of other witnesses, including Hunter Biden and the whistleblower, but it is not yet clear whether any will be permitted to testify by Democrats on the committee as part of the inquiry."

HISTORIC TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS SET TO BEGIN, AS DEMS PREDICT 'PHENOMENAL WEEK'

With the bang of a gavel, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will open the impeachment hearings Wednesday into Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate the 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden's dealings in the country.

The former vice president has boasted about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, as his son Hunter Biden held a lucrative role board of a Ukrainian natural gas company despite having little relevant expertise.

MIKE HUCKABEE SLAMS ADAM SCHIFF, CALLING IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY A TV SHOW 'TO CREATE A SPECTACLE'

Schiff, in a memo and open letter to colleagues on the eve of Wednesday's proceedings, outlined some of the rules -- including that members not assigned to the Intelligence Committee were not permitted to make statements or question witnesses, but were allowed to sit in the audience.

McCarthy said there has never been “something so partisan” and that the impeachment inquiry is a “pure” setup by Schiff.

“There’s no due process, the president’s attorney is not in the room, cannot cross-examine, we can not have our witnesses, we can’t have a whistleblower who this all started from, an individual who was not even on the phone call,” McCarthy said.

A whistleblower's complaint about Trump's July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ignited the impeachment investigation. During the hearing Wednesday, a key exchange during that 30-minute call, which has been outlined in a Sept. 24 transcript released by the White House, could take center stage. Zelensky has said he felt no pressure during the call.

Where to start?

“Anonymous” is a self-admitted coward. He, or she, apparently still works within the administration. A true patriot would resign and go public so their accusations could be tested. Writing a book like this while still on the public payroll is more than cowardly, it is also an attempt to disregard, disrespect and dishonor the people who voted for Donald Trump.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: THE 'WHISTLEBLOWER' AND THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE

Next comes the testimony starting Wednesday of carefully selected “witnesses” before Rep. Adam Schiff’s “intelligence” committee (now there’s a play on words). These testimonies are designed to advance the left’s narrative about Ukraine, but only the narrative that fits their agenda and not the one featuring a real quid pro quo involving then-Vice President Joe Biden and his overpaid son, who held a directorship with a Ukraine energy company while his father was vice president and involved in U.S. policy on Ukraine. At the time, the elder Biden urged Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, with the threat of withholding U.S. aid.

Having failed at other attempts to smear the president, this is the Democrat’s last gasp. They must know that even if they draw up dubious articles of impeachment, the Senate won’t vote to convict and remove Trump from office. This could create one of the biggest political backfires in history if the public perceives it as unfair and driven by bias, ignoring evidence that would be to the president’s benefit.

Take one example of many that unmask the objective of the anti-Trumpers, which has been obvious at least since the 2016 election.

The attorneys for the so-called “whistleblower,” the person who heard from someone who listened to the call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine, have numerous Twitter postings stating their intentions. Here are some of them taken directly from their tweets.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

From Mark S. Zaid: “#coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion #impeachment will follow ultimately.” This tweet was posted just after the president was sworn in and before he had done anything.

In the summer of 2017, Zaid tweeted “We will get rid of Trump” and “as one (coup) fails two more will take their place.” He repeats these sentiments and objectives over many months. Zaid also predicted CNN would be an ally in the pursuit of impeachment. Anyone examining that network’s “reporting” can attest to the accuracy of his prediction.

The other attorney for the whistleblower, Andrew Bakaj, also appears to be an anti-Trumper. He has tweeted that the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. That’s the standard (in) the 25th Amendment.”

All of this is the stuff of show trials and banana republics. The left does not have a single issue on which they can defeat the president, most especially when it comes to the economy and the lowest unemployment in nearly 50 years, and as Trump claims, “the highest stock market ever.”

If the public comes to see this as the partisan assault that it is and a power play to nullify the will of the voters who elected the president in 2016 — assuming they pay attention during the coming holidays — this could prove the greatest political disaster for them since Walter Mondale lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan in 1984.

And they will deserve it.

Public Trump impeachment hearings set to begin, as Dems predict 'phenomenal week'

In a pillared House chamber at 10 a.m. ET Wednesday, in the shadow of the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, House Democrats are set to host the first public hearing involving the potential impeachment of a president since Nov. 19, 1998 -- and, they insist, they aren't happy about it. However, behind the scenes, House Democrats were predicting a ""phenomenal week,"" Fox News is told.

At the same time, Republicans have been preparing a methodical and vigorous cross-examination of Democrats' witnesses, whose accounts of President Trump's alleged wrongdoing have been based largely on hearsay and intuition, critics say.

The allegations: With the bang of a gavel, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will open the impeachment hearings Wednesday into Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden's dealings in the country. The former vice president has boasted about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, as his son Hunter Biden held a lucrative role board of a Ukrainian natural gas company despite having little relevant expertise.

An anonymous whistleblower's complaint about Trump's July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ignited the impeachment investigation. During the hearing Wednesday, a key exchange during that 30-minute call, which has been outlined in a Sept. 24 transcript released by the White House, is expected to take center stage. Democrats say Trump wanted the investigations in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. The president, Democrats allege, tried to use the power of his office to pressure a foreign government into helping him politically.

Zelensky has said he felt no pressure during the call. Trump has said the call was ""perfect"" and contained no ""quid pro quo,"" or this for that.

Shortly after Schiff's gavel, he and intelligence panel ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are to begin the questioning. They get 45 minutes each or can designate staff attorneys to ask the questions. Members of the panel will then get five minutes each to question witnesses, alternating between Republicans and Democrats.

Key Witnesses: Democrats chose Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe, to kick off the public hearings. The two likely will describe the foreign policy toward Ukraine led by Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and other White House officials.

Democrats also told Fox News that Taylor had ""the best view of the scheme. He is a habitual note-taker. He is your worst nightmare. Very prepared."" Still, Taylor wasn’t on the phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Fox News is told Republicans will cross-examine Taylor repeatedly over his lack of ""first-hand knowledge"" about the call.

Kent, a career foreign service officer, testified Oct. 15 there were three words Trump wanted to hear from the Ukraine president: ""Investigations, Biden and Clinton."" He also told the investigators about the ""campaign"" of smears Giuliani led against former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. That led to her being recalled from the position. Yovanovitch is set to testify Friday. Click here for more on our top story.

White House to set up cameras to livestream border wall construction: report

Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, and other White House officials are planning to set up web cameras to livestream construction along the border wall, according to a report. Kushner first offered the proposal during a July meeting, pitching the idea as a way to confront criticism that Trump has not followed through on his signature 2016 campaign promise, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed officials.

Trump, Erdogan set to meet at White House with tension running high

President Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will meet Wednesday amid a strained relationship between the two NATO allies. Turkey has rebuffed the U.S. and is turning toward Russia on security issues and Ankara is facing a Washington backlash over attacks on Kurdish civilians during its incursion into Syria last month.

Erdogan and Trump face an agenda that includes Turkey's decision to buy a Russian air defense system and its attack on U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria. On Tuesday, the Turkish leader issued a chilling threat to Europe over looming sanctions over Ankara's unauthorized drilling in the Mediterranean: penalize us and we'll release ISIS prisoners back to European countries.

IMPEACHMENT SHOW DEBUTS

Fox News: “Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings delivered a stark account Wednesday of President Trump’s pursuit of political ‘investigations’ in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani’s alleged meddling in that country, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ‘low-rent Ukrainian sequel’ to the Russia collusion case. For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. … But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.”



GOP Senators skip - AP: “Millions of Americans are expected to watch on live TV Wednesday as the House kicks off public hearings on whether to impeach President Donald Trump. Just don’t expect many Republican senators to be among them, if a quick sampling of them is to be believed. Of eight Senate Republicans questioned Tuesday evening, seven said they wouldn’t watch Wednesday’s start of the Democratic-led process or suggested it wasn’t a priority. ‘Tomorrow I’m going to be paying attention to what we’re doing in the Senate,’ said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said he’d be chairing an Environment and Public Works Committee session.”



What will impeachment mean for 2020 Dems? - Politico: “The degree to which the Democrats in Congress who are running the impeachment inquiry are disconnected from their colleagues running for president cannot be overstated. Impeachment and the presidential primary are like two planets slowly pulled together by gravity that are finally about to collide — nobody seems to know who will survive impact. … ‘This is kind of like if Roland Emmerich decided to make a movie about American politics,’ said a senior Biden adviser, speaking of the German filmmaker known for his disaster films. ‘No one would have predicted that we are potentially looking at a January where six Democratic presidential candidates are potentially serving on a jury in which Donald Trump is the defendant.’”



Trump wanted to fire inspector general for disloyalty - NYT: “President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower’s complaint about Mr. Trump’s interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower’s complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said. The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said.”



Trump welcomes Turkish strongman Erdogan - AP: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Donald Trump met Wednesday as relations between the NATO allies are at their lowest point in decades, with Turkey drifting closer to Russia and Ankara facing a Washington backlash over its offensive against Kurds in Syria. Erdogan and Trump have a difficult agenda. They will discuss Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian air defense system despite its membership in NATO and its incursion into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish forces who have fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State group. The issues threaten to jeopardize a potentially lucrative trade deal between the two countries. The leaders’ scheduled afternoon news conference, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, will give Trump a stage to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry.”

TIME OUT: FINDING THE ‘LOST CITY’

NatGeo: “In 1976 a group of Colombian archaeologists and their guides embarked on a grueling mission to save and ancient site from looters. Swinging machetes, they inched their way over the thick, jungled foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta near Colombia’s Caribbean coast. … Their mission was urgent: Authorities had been tipped off that a major archaeological site had been found by huaqueros, archaeological looters. Items from the site had already begun appearing on the antiquities black market. The team needed to bring the site under state control before more damage was done to the country’s heritage. The team was trying to reach an area that is generally known as Teyuna, which they had taken to calling a more informal name: Ciudad Perdida, ‘lost city.’ The Tairona had abandoned many of their settlements in the late 1600s, but their descendants who still live in the Sierra Nevada had never really considered the city lost.”

HILLARY OPEN TO 2020 RUN: ‘I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME’

USA Today: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, ‘I never say never to anything.’ The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was ‘100%’ certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks ‘all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world.’ ‘So of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time,’ she said. … ‘I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,’ she said. ‘But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.’”



Buttigieg’s New Hampshire plan counts on indies - Politico: “As Pete Buttigieg boarded his campaign bus … a New Hampshire voter stopped him to ask if campaign staffers were hawking ‘Republicans for Pete’ stickers yet. They aren’t. But Buttigieg, who’s staking out center-left ground in the Democratic presidential primary, is trying to build a coalition of unaffiliated voters to go along with Democrats and make a surprise splash in the open-primary state featuring two senators-next-door, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, campaigning on the left. At town halls during his latest swing across New Hampshire, Buttigieg name-checked ‘future former Republicans’ in the same breath as ‘progressives and moderates ... ready for some kind of change.’ His organizers are targeting independent voters from the new field offices Buttigieg opened this fall. And while Buttigieg is polling well in both Iowa and New Hampshire right now … the presence of non-Democrats in the New Hampshire Democratic primary — unlike Iowa’s closed caucus system — could prove decisive in a tight Democratic nominating race...”



But South Carolina looms - National Review: “…a big question hanging over Buttigieg’s head is whether he can make sufficient inroads with African-American primary voters to capture the nomination. Black voters make up about a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate, but two thirds of South Carolina primary voters are black, and Buttigieg remains stuck in the single digits in the Palmetto State. … Buttigieg’s weakness in South Carolina is partly a function of the fact that Joe Biden, former vice president to America’s first black president, retains a commanding lead among black voters. But Buttigieg’s weakness is also partly a function of his sexual orientation, as David Catanese reported in The State last month: ‘Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a possible reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: some see his sexuality as a problem.’”



Sanders tries to sway Hispanic lawmakers - Politico: “Bernie Sanders met privately with Hispanic lawmakers on Tuesday. Sanders, who has aggressively courted Latino voters in his 2020 bid for the White House, is the third presidential candidate to sit down with Latino members under the auspices of BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have also talked with BOLD PAC. Sanders spoke about immigration, Medicare for All, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other issues, including his family’s immigrant roots. A Latino caucus member in the room said several undecided lawmakers were present, and that Sanders did not exclusively talk about economic issues.”



Patrick could complicate Warren’s campaign - Politico: “When Elizabeth Warren was asked to name three African Americans she'd choose for her presidential cabinet last week, she pointed to her friend Deval Patrick as one of them. But the former Massachusetts governor had other ideas. Around the same time, the former governor and a handful of close allies were huddling not far from Warren's campaign headquarters, plotting a surprise entry into the Democratic primary. The now-public prospect of his candidacy — and its potential effect on Warren, who has recently emerged as a Democratic frontrunner — is suddenly the subject of intense speculation among the Massachusetts political class. … His potential entry into the Democratic primary undoubtedly puts a strain on their relationship. Several Massachusetts Democrats — who declined to go on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue — viewed reports that Patrick was preparing to join the field as an affront to Warren, who has been running hard for nearly a year.”



Is there a path for Bloomberg or Patrick? - NYT: “Both men have concluded in recent weeks that Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is not the imposing adversary they had expected him to be, interviews with aides and allies show. Both also believe there is room in the race for a more dynamic candidate who is closer to the political middle than Mr. Biden’s two most prominent challengers, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. Should Mr. [Michael] Bloomberg and Mr. Patrick enter the race, they would test that proposition in different ways: Mr. Bloomberg with a powerfully funded campaign that would take on President Trump directly and contest the biggest states on the primary map from the start; Mr. Patrick with an insurgent candidacy that would begin in next-door New Hampshire and run through South Carolina, where black voters are likely to decide the primary.”

AUDIBLE: THESE GO TO 11

“For those who continually ask, you should just expect that we will continue to make news every day. So don’t ask ‘what’s on tap?’ Just know something’s on tap.” – A House Democratic aide working on the impeachment inquiry said during a conference call with Hill reporters, per Time magazine.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Normally, I hate doing housework, but these days I would rather vacuum than listen to the news. Fortunately, I have the Halftime Report to bring some sanity and understanding to the process. I have a question that I can't seem to find an answer to, and with your vast experience, I was hoping that you know the answer. There is so much argument over who the Democrats will let the Republicans call as witnesses. When it goes to trial in the Senate won't they be able to call whoever they want to testify and uncover anything the Democrats are trying to hide? By the way, I would gladly trade you some good KC BBQ for a few of those pepperoni rolls you are so fond of.” – Tom Steele, Bates City, Mo.



[Ed. note: You are on, Mr. Steele! And yes, you’re quite right about the witness-list histrionics. This is, as they would say in Gregsville, some stuff people say. (Though they don’t really say “stuff.”) Republicans want to reinforce their preferred narrative: This is a kangaroo court and Democrats are denying the president due process. Everything at hand will be pressed into service of that goal.]



“Could Joe Biden's lead in national polling, but not in individual states, be explained by how well he piles up voters in a few very large states e. g. New York, Illinois, and California?” – Tom Snyder, Frankfort, Ill.



[Ed. note: There might be some truth in that, Mr. Snyder. But a couple of things to remember: Good pollsters look for representative geographical distributions. That should be somewhat of a control on that phenomenon. But the larger consideration is that we don’t have any evidence that Biden runs better in these places. We have basically no useful polling in Illinois, but the polling we have from California and New York shows Biden running neck and neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. National polling tells me that Biden’s base isn’t geographic as much as it is demographic. He does best with non-white voters, especially women. If a Democratic candidate had to choose any bloc on which to base his or her candidacy, that would be the one to pick.]



“So the Democrats have moved their December debate to Loyola Marymount. What are they thinking? It's a fine school but Roman Catholic. You know, the institution with no women priests, the one steadfastly opposed to abortion, gay marriage, etc.” – Stuart Barr, Durham, N.C.



[Ed. note: But Will Joe Biden take communion while he’s there?]



“Chris, It occurs to me that polls and surveys (now a routine part of everybody's lives) supports and reinforces the identity politics of the far left. There was a time (in my distant past) when surveys, etc. only identified people by partisan segment (Democrat, Republican, Independent) and location. Beyond that, we were all ‘Americans.’ Now we go much deeper into who people are by describing their demographic associations. While the factions that the founding fathers warned against undoubtedly benefit, they do so by knowing which demographic groups to target and shape their messages accordingly. … I was raised believing that voting was my opportunity to express my view regarding who would be best for the WHOLE country. I NEVER hear that point of view anymore either in the family, in the classroom, in the media. I rarely hear it in political ads. Your thoughts?” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I don’t know how much of this phenomenon you can lay at the feet of public pollsters. The revolution in public opinion research began more than 40 years ago as marketing gurus demanded better ways to sell floor wax, Ford Granadas and Funyuns. People with carpets don’t need floor wax, people who only drive Chevys don’t care about Granadas and Funyuns, while not broadly popular, have a hugely devoted core of enthusiasts. So companies decided it would be worth spending money to find out how to target the hardwood-floor-having-Ford-loving-Funyun-scarfing population rather than just wasting money on broad-spectrum ads. Back then it was about finding the right magazines and television shows in which to advertise. In time, the same kind of market research being used in corporate America made it over to the far-less-lucrative world of politics. Politics had always been about message targeting based on the demographics of various precincts. Since the birth of the republic, politicians targeted their messages to the constituents of various precincts. Gerrymandering, after all, has been with us from the start. But thanks to marketing magic, by the turn of the 21st century, campaigns were able to engage in “micro-targeting,” in which they could zero in on specific demographic subsets in geographic areas. Are you a gun-rights zealot but live in an overwhelmingly Democratic neighborhood? Are you usually an indifferent Republican-leaner, but are ardently pro-choice? Campaigns became increasingly able to zero in on you with ads, calls and mail. The trend exploded with the birth of online advertising. That all would be happening however public pollsters conducted their work. By the way, the reason polls have to pay attention to demographics – gender, ethnicity, income, education, etc. – is so that we end up with samples that are actually representative of the country. If you knew that there were 100 purple marbles, 50 green marbles and 25 orange marbles in a pouch and pulled five oranges in a row you might start to wonder about your sampling methods.]



“With the potential for a 3-way tie at the top of the Democrat pack, do you think Michael Bloomberg is counting on being the compromise candidate at a brokered convention? By at least getting his name in, he is signaling his availability when they realize ‘none of the above’ can win.” – Sheila Willis, Toronto, Canada



[Ed. note: I think there’s quite a bit to that, Ms. Willis. And hey, why not? The median net worth for an American household is, according to the Federal Reserve, just shy of $100,000. Bloomberg is worth something like $50 billion. If he spent, let’s say, $50 million on a just-in-case candidacy that would be .1 percent of his fortune – the equivalent of $100 for the average family.]



“Yes, Branagh’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is worth a look. But so is the night-before-battle scene where Henry wanders through the camp in disguise to gauge the spirit of the troops. Branagh does not hold back on the moral ambivalence of the original Shakespeare. In contrast, Sir Laurence Olivier, commissioned by Churchill in wartime, had to tone the camp scene down in his 1944 version. And Olivier’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is also stirring for this Veteran’s Day, but in a different style.” – John McNeill Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.

“Chris, I didn't know where to send this now that you’re off twitter. Since I get the Halftime Report I figured this is as good a place as any. … I'm a Midwestern boy and in trying to find my father a solid gift for Christmas last year I needed a new plan. … My first place to start was with bacon. My father (as with most Midwestern men) loves bacon. So I set out with my Google Fu to find the best there is to offer. Seemed that most signs pointed to one man and his amazing Tennessee smoked bacon and hams. Bentons County Hickory Smoked Bacon is said to be some amazing stuff. … I in no way work for Bentons or have any affiliation with them, I’m just a fan of wonderful bacon. I ordered him a box and he was so blown away I had to get myself one after the holidays to test the hype. It's some awesome stuff. … So if you have not heard of this amazing goodness I thought I would throw it on your radar… I hope you and your family have a wonderful set of holidays.” – Matt Ladd, Arlington, Va.



[Ed. note: I have many times enjoyed Benton’s delicious bacon and hams, Mr. Ladd. I, myself, prefer Edwards of Virginia, but then again, my tastes run more toward country ham over bacon for luxury cured meats. Benton’s ham is marvelous, too. But you may want to check out a bone-in Wigwam ham from Edwards this year. Pure ambrosia. And unlike the bacon, when you’re done, you can make bean soup!]

WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS…

The Island Packet: “Parrish Brown thought it was strange when the Hilton Head Island [S.C.] McDonald’s worker paused as he ordered a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon. ‘Extra lemon?’ the drive-thru worker asked in an odd voice. Brown later figured out what the ‘extra lemon’ was about when he discovered quite a bit of weed inside his sweet tea — after he drank it, at work. The 24-year-old Charleston man called the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office … to report the incident. ‘I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” Brown said. … Finally … he opened up the lid only to find something he wasn’t expecting: three bags of marijuana. … ‘I kept being like ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’’ he said. ‘The officer asked me why I drank it and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“…History has been unkind to every stripe of utopian thinking. But it is not just that we have failed to achieve the messianic future. Even the democratic present is under widespread assault.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in a 2017 essay “The Authoritarian Temptation,” published in his posthumous book, “The Point of It All.”

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., kicked off the first public hearing of the Trump impeachment inquiry Wednesday by dismissing the allegations as a ""carefully orchestrated smear campaign"" and a ""low-rent"" follow-up to the Russia investigation, which failed to produce evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow.

Nunes addressed Wednesday's witnesses, Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and State Department official George Kent, stating that they are being used in a ""televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats,"" after accusing Democrats of selecting witnesses ""deemed suitable for television"" and auditioning them during the closed-door sessions at the beginning of the inquiry.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HEARINGS BEGIN: LIVE BLOG

""It seems you agreed witting or unwittingly to participate in a drama, but the main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended and you’ve been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel,"" Nunes said during his opening statement.

The Republican leader expressed cynicism toward the allegations that President Trump pressured Ukraine into investigating Democratic activities during the 2016 election, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

""We're supposed to take these people at face value when they trot out with a new batch of allegations,"" he said, ""but anyone familiar with the Democrats' scorched-earth war against President Trump would not be surprised to see all the typical signs that this is a carefully orchestrated media smear campaign.""

Nunes said that while Democrats have accused Trump of improper activity involving Russia and Ukraine, the Democrats themselves are the ones who are guilty.

""For years they accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia when they themselves were colluding with Russia by funding and spreading the Steele dossier, which relied on Russian sources,"" he said. ""And now they accuse President Trump of malfeasance in Ukraine when they themselves are culpable.""

Nunes concluded by maintaining the president's innocence and insisting the ongoing inquiry is ""nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime.""

Nunes' statement followed one from Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.. Schiff outlined the parameters of the impeachment inquiry, questioning whether the president sought to condition official acts and ""exploit"" Ukraine's ""vulnerability"" for personal political gain.

""The matter is as simple and as terrible as that,"" Schiff said in his opening statement Wednesday. ""Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief.""

Schiff described the core of the impeachment inquiry, and said: ""If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?”

GOP ON DEFENSE AHEAD OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Fox News: “Three top Republicans serving on panels involved in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump penned a memo to GOP members on those committees outlining ‘key points of evidence’ from the closed-door inquiry ahead of public hearings slated to begin Wednesday. Addressed to the GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, the memo outlines arguments in defense of Trump. It makes the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They say Trump had a ‘deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid’ due to the country's history of ‘pervasive corruption’ since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The memo points out that both Trump and Zelensky have said they felt no pressure during the call. Another piece of evidence cited by the memo's authors is that Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump in an effort to sway the race in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a claim that Trump has made but has not been proven.”



Schiff warns GOP about going after Bidens - Fox News: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff set the stage for the first public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry by vowing to keep questions at Wednesday's lead-off session focused on the Ukraine controversy -- in an implicit shot at Republican members who have signaled an interest in turning the tables on Democrats as they defend President Trump. … Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up. The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.”



Mulvaney reverses course, will follow Trump’s order not to cooperate - WaPo: “On the eve of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, President Trump complained that Democrats are relying on ‘2nd and 3rd hand witnesses,’ while a memo by Republican staff previewed how they plan to defend him. … In morning tweets, Trump, meanwhile, said that both Bidens should be called as witnesses in the public hearings that begin Wednesday with testimony from two State Department officials. … Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney no longer plans to seek a judge’s ruling on whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry and will instead follow Trump’s order not to cooperate. In a court filing Tuesday, Mulvaney’s lawyer said Mulvaney is reversing course and would not file suit seeking a court opinion on whether he must comply with a House subpoena.”

TIME OUT: REVISITING A PIVOTAL WWII BATTLE

Smithsonian: “‘At the present time we have only enough water for two weeks. Please supply us immediately,’ read the message sent by American sailors stationed at Midway, a tiny atoll located roughly halfway between North America and Asia, on May 20, 1942. The plea for help, however, was a giant ruse; the base was not, in fact, low on supplies. When Tokyo Naval Intelligence intercepted the dispatch and relayed the news onward … their American counterparts finally confirmed what they had long suspected: Midway and ‘AF,’ cited by the Japanese as the target of a major upcoming military operation, were one and the same. This codebreaking operation afforded the United States a crucial advantage at what would be the Battle of Midway, a multi-day naval and aerial engagement fought between June 3 and 7, 1942. … Midway, a new movie from director Roland Emmerich … traces the trajectory of the early Pacific campaign from the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor to the Halsey-Doolittle Raid in April 1942, the Battle of the Coral Sea in May of that same year, and, finally, Midway itself.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO FIRST PLACE IN IOWA

Monmouth University: “South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the leaderboard in the third Monmouth University Poll of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Buttigieg’s gains since the summer have been across the board, with increasing support coming from nearly every demographic group. Regardless, less than one-third of likely caucusgoers say that they are firmly set on their choice of candidate and most would not be too disappointed if they had to switch their support. The poll also finds that Mike Bloomberg receives a chilly reception among Hawkeye State Democrats as he considers whether to make a late entry into the nomination contest. Four candidates are currently vying for the top spot in Iowa’s caucuses – Buttigieg (22%), Biden (19%), Warren (18%), and Sanders (13%). Compared to Monmouth’s August poll, Buttigieg has gained 14 points (up from 8%)…”



Sanders falls to fourth in Granite State - Quinnipiac University: “With less than 100 days to go, former Vice President Joe Biden has an edge in New Hampshire's Democratic primary for president, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Biden receives support from 20 percent of New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters, with Senator Elizabeth Warren getting 16 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg getting 15 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 14 percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard gets 6 percent, businessman Andrew Yang gets 4 percent, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent, and 14 percent of likely voters are undecided. Independent voters, known as ‘undeclared voters’ in New Hampshire, who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary are divided in their top choice. Biden receives 16 percent support among these voters, while Sanders and Buttigieg get 14 percent each, and Warren and Gabbard receive 10 percent each.”



Mark Sanford drops out of presidential race - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford dropped out of the race for president just moments ago, ending his protest bid 60 days after it began. In a noon press conference at the New Hampshire Statehouse, Sanford announced his long-shot run is ending after previously declaring he would spend most of November campaigning in the Granite State, site of the nation’s first primary. The move came after Sanford failed to collect much of a following, especially as President Donald Trump remains the favorite of most Republican voters nationally and while Washington is gearing up for impeachment hearings. Sanford said the impeachment inquiry surrounding the president had sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the 2020 debate. ‘You gotta be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ he said, adding he is suspending the campaign and will look for other ways to advance his stance against the deficit.”



Former governor of Massachusetts considering bid - NYT: “Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has told Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations, the latest evidence of how unsettled the party’s primary is less than three months before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats.”



Sen. Michael Bennet expanding campaign in N.H. - WMUR: “While another Democratic presidential candidate is cutting back her effort in New Hampshire and still another is pulling out of the state entirely, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is expanding his presence and making a bold commitment. The Bennet campaign currently has one New Hampshire office, in Manchester, and small number of staffers in the state. But that’s about to change. The Bennet campaign told WMUR on Monday that within the next several weeks, it will open three new offices, including a new office in Manchester, and is currently ‘aggressively hiring’ additional Granite State staffers. Bennet made a public commitment. ‘Spending time with New Hampshire voters has made me a better candidate,’ he said in a statement shared with WMUR.”



Milwaukee DNC replaces top fundraiser - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “There's been a quiet shakeup in the leadership of the fundraising team for next year's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Out as the Host Committee's fundraising director is Marcus Switzer, a 32-year-old Milwaukee native who served as deputy national fundraising director for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Switzer has returned to Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign team. Switzer held the post for about six months. Replacing him is Leah Israel, a 36-year-old Chicago native who worked as a fundraiser for U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat. … In her new post as fundraising director, Israel is taking on the daunting task of raising up to $70 million for next July's big event.”



SUPREME COURT DIVIDED OVER FUTURE OF DACA

Fox News: “The future of the DACA program for young illegal immigrants remained uncertain as the Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared to lack consensus on whether the Trump administration's plans to rescind legal protections for so-called Dreamers were proper. The cases were debated during 80 minutes of tense oral arguments. No side appeared to command a clear majority of justices over what has become a major test of executive power on the contentious issue of immigration reform. At issue is the Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It was created under executive order and gives about 700,000 people brought as children to the United States illegally --or on visas that later were overstayed -- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit. Hundreds of Dreamers and their supporters rallied outside the court. Members of Congress were among those watching the arguments inside.”



LA. GOVERNOR’S RACE SEES RECORD NUMBER IN EARLY VOTING

Monroe [La.] News Star: “Louisiana loves voting early with voters coming close to setting an all-time record last week for the Nov. 16 governor's election. In all, 489,654 cast early ballots for the Nov. 16 runoff between Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone in a race generally considered a tossup. That's 100,000 plus more ballots than were cast early for the Oct. 12 primary that whittled the field to Edwards and Rispone. ‘This is a sea change between what existed previously,’ said Pearson Cross, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette political science professor. ‘I think it's a good thing that spurs turnout.’ … Early voting isn't likely to hit 40% of the total for the Nov. 16 election, but it could account for a third or more of total votes cast. Trump will headline another rally at 7 p.m. Thursday at the CenturyLink Center in Bossier City.”



Widow Rep. Elijah Cummings announces campaign for husband's seat - Fox News: “The widow of late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said on Monday that she will launch a campaign to win her husband’s seat as representative of Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. Maryland Democratic Party Chairwoman Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, initially told The Baltimore Sun that she would formally announce her campaign on Tuesday, nearly a month after her husband died of cancer on Oct. 17 at age 68. … In her first televised interview since her husband’s death, Rockeymoore Cummings said on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show Monday evening that she and her husband decided about six months ago that she would be the best fit to carry on his legacy and vision for the Baltimore district.

AUDIBLE: ‘THE ENEMY WITHIN’

“Our politics are paralyzing the country. We practice suspicion or contempt where trust is needed, imposing a sentence of anger and loneliness on others and ourselves. We scorch our opponents with language that precludes compromise. We brush aside the possibility that a person with whom we disagree might be right. We talk about what divides us and seldom acknowledge what unites us. … Contending viewpoints and vocal dissent are inevitable, and not the issue. … What is dangerous is not that people have serious differences. It is the tone—the snarl, the scorn, the lacerating despair.” – Former Defense Secretary James Mattis in his piece “The Enemy Within,” published in the Atlantic.

MARATHON MAN

BBC: “A British man has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world. Nick Butter, 30, from Bristol, [England] has run 196 marathons in 196 countries after starting in Canada in January 2018 and finishing in Greece on Sunday. He was inspired to do it to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK after a friend was diagnosed with the disease. Mr. Butter said he was ‘overwhelmed’ to have finished, after he crossed the finishing line of the Athens marathon. He said he was ‘very tired’ after completing the challenge, which took 674 days and involved visiting an average of just over two countries a week. … He chose Athens for his final run due to it being ‘the home of the marathon.’ Mr. Butter, originally from Dorset, [England] crossed the line with his friend Kevin Webber, who has prostate cancer and who inspired him to take up the challenge.”

""It’s a sad day,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, told Fox News on Tuesday. ""A calm day. A prayerful day."" For his part, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called the hearings a ""solemn undertaking"" in a letter to colleagues.

Behind the scenes, House Democrats were predicting a ""phenomenal week,"" Fox News is told. At the same time, Republicans have been preparing a methodical and vigorous cross-examination of Democrats' witnesses, whose accounts of President Trump's alleged wrongdoing have been based largely on hearsay and intuition.

Capitol Hill security officials told Fox News they're not anticipating the kinds of organized protests that rocked the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh last year, but sources on both sides of the aisle have cautioned that the day will be unpredictable. The proceedings are to be held in the cavernous House Ways and Means Committee hearing room at the Longworth House Office Building.

PRIVATE MILITARY SELLERS PRESSURED PENTAGON TO RESUME UKRAINE AID, DEFENSE DEPT OFFICIAL TESTIFIES

With the bang of a gavel, Schiff will open the impeachment hearings Wednesday into Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden's dealings in the country. The former vice president, a Democrat, has boasted about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, as his son Hunter Biden held a lucrative role board of a Ukrainian natural gas company despite having little relevant expertise.

A whistleblower's complaint about Trump's July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ignited the impeachment investigation. During the hearing Wednesday, a key exchange during that 30-minute call, which has been outlined in a Sept. 24 transcript released by the White House, could take center stage. Zelensky has said he felt no pressure during the call.

""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" Trump said at one point in the call, after a mention of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Ukraine apparently was not aware that the U.S. was withholding new military aid until August, approximately two weeks before the U.S. ultimately released the aid and well after Trump's phone call with Zelensky.

EMAILS OBTAINED BY FOX NEWS SHOW KEY DEM IMPEACHMENT WITNESS WASN'T HONEST UNDER OATH, GOP SEN SAYS

On the call, Trump then asked Zelensky to investigate reports that Ukraine had some involvement in 2016 election interference (Politico has reported that Ukraine worked behind the scenes to boost Hillary Clinton.) Later on in the conversation, amid a discussion of deep-seated Ukrainian corruption, Trump mentioned Biden's push to have Ukraine's prosecutor fired, and suggested the country look into the matter.

Republicans have pointed out that the U.S. also delayed military aid assistance for Lebanon and Armenia. The GOP is expected to say the European Union was not doing its fair share to help root out corruption in Ukraine.

“The Russia invasion of Crimea had more to do with Europe than with the U.S.,” one Republican source told Fox News.

Trump has said the call was ""perfect"" and contained no ""quid pro quo,"" or this for that. Democrats, meanwhile, have said it showed Trump using his office to pressure a foreign government to help him politically.

Big questions loomed, including how strongly administration officials connected Trump's apparent desire for a probe to the question of whether to provide military aid to Ukraine -- and whether such a probe would have been inappropriate. At its heart, the GOP argument was that the impeachment effort was unfair and sparked because ""unelected and anonymous bureaucrats disagreed"" with Trump's decisions on Ukraine.

Shortly after Schiff's gavel, he and ranking Republican Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are to begin the questioning. They get 45 minutes each, or can designate staff attorneys to do so.

ICIG COMPLAINT ALLEGES UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER MAY HAVE ILLEGALLY SOLICITED FUNDS FROM 'PROHIBITED SOURCES'

Members of the panel will then get five minutes each to ask questions, alternating between Republicans and Democrats.

For the Democrats, expect to hear from Daniel Goldman and Daniel Noble, both counsels for the Intelligence Committee. Fox News is told on the GOP side, Steve Castor, whom Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan brought over from the Oversight Committee, will be the counsel to pose questions for the minority.

Republicans recently placed Jordan on the Intelligence Committee. Though Nunes is the senior Republican, the congressman from Ohio could act as an especially fierce attacker of the witnesses' credibility and the Democrats' case for impeachment.

Goldman and Castor asked the bulk of the questions of witnesses during weeks of closed-door depositions with current and former administration officials and diplomats.

""You're going to see a prosecutorial approach,"" said Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Goldman to successfully prosecute a Genovese family boss and two mob hit men for racketeering, two murders and an attempted murder. ""You will see somebody who knows every detail of every piece of evidence and will bring it to bear in his questioning. You'll see someone who knows how to get right to the point.""

Goldman is a left-wing partisan who has promoted the largely discredited Steele dossier that kickstarted the Russia collusion narrative. A nearly two-year investigation by the special counsel's office failed to substantiate numerous key claims in the dossier, including that Russians possessed a lewd tape of the president, that Michael Cohen traveled to Prague as part of a conspiracy, or that the president's campaign was employing hackers in the U.S. to subvert the election.

Democrats chose Ambassador Bill Taylor and career Foreign Service officer George Kent to kick off the public hearings. ""They both were witness to the full storyline of the president’s misconduct,"" a Democratic aide told Fox News.

The two likely will describe a parallel foreign policy toward Ukraine led by Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and other White House officials.

""I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing and ultimately alarming circumstances,"" Taylor testified in an Oct. 22 statement. Taylor, a West Point graduate and Vietnam War veteran who has served under every presidential administration, Republican and Democrat, since 1985, also worked for then-Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.

Taylor said it was ""crazy"" that the Trump administration may have been withholding U.S. military assistance to the Eastern European ally over the political investigations, with Russian forces on Ukraine's border on watch for a moment of weakness.

Fox News is told the Democrats' game plan has been to let the witnesses ""tell their story"" on Wednesday. ""We need to facilitate and stay out of the way,"" one Democrat involved in the questioning said.

Democrats also told Fox News that Taylor had ""the best view of the scheme. He is a habitual note-taker. He is your worst nightmare. Very prepared.""

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL FLAGGED HUNTER BIDEN'S 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST' IN UKRAINE, TESTIMONY SHOWS

One source told Fox News the most important line in all of the previously released transcripts so far may have come from Taylor: ""Irregular policy channels were running contrary to longstanding goals of U.S. policy,"" Taylor said in his testimony.

But, Republicans have countered that it's the role of the president -- not unelected career bureaucrats -- to set U.S. foreign policy.

And, Taylor wasn’t on the phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Fox News is told Republicans will cross-examine Taylor repeatedly over his lack of ""first-hand knowledge"" about the call.

""Hearsay puts a lot of people in jail,"" one Democratic source told Fox News. ""Eyewitness testimony can be tough. Cops will tell you that. Taylor's deducing all of this.""

Republicans, meanwhile, are expected to ask Taylor how and why he thought there was a ""linkage"" and ""who told you that.""

Kent, a career foreign service officer, testified on Oct. 15 there were three words Trump wanted to hear from the Ukraine president: ""Investigations, Biden and Clinton.""

He also told the investigators about the ""campaign"" of smears against former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch that he said Giuliani waged, leading to her being recalled from the position.

Yovanovitch is set to testify Friday. She previously testified on Oct. 11 that she was told people were ""looking to hurt"" her.

Fox News reported last week that Yovanovitch, a key witness for Democrats, communicated via her personal email account with a Democratic congressional staffer concerning a ""quite delicate"" and ""time-sensitive"" matter -- just two days after the whistleblower complaint that kickstarted the inquiry was filed, and a month before the complaint became public.

Emails obtained by Fox News appeared to contradict Yovanovitch's deposition on Capitol Hill last month, in which she told U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., about an email she received Aug. 14 from the staffer, Laura Carey -- but suggested under oath that she never responded to it.

'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY ANNOUNCES IN 2017

Zeldin told Fox News: ""I specifically asked her whether the Democratic staffer was responded to by Yovanovitch or the State Department. It is greatly concerning that Ambassador Yovanovitch didn't answer my question as honestly as she should have, especially while under oath.""

Republicans have privately acknowledged to Fox News that they might have a problem. ""How do you counteract Kent and Taylor when you don’t have a witness to counter them?"" one Republican source asked.

Schiff has approved just three of nine witnesses sought by the GOP. They were envoy Kurt Volker, State Department official David Hale and National Security Council aide Timothy Morrison.

Last week, Schiff rejected a request by Republicans to have the Ukraine phone call whistleblower testify, saying that their testimony was ""redundant and unnecessary."" The GOP witness list, obtained by Fox News this past Saturday, also included Hunter Biden.

Late Tuesday, Schiff announced that open hearings will again be held next week from Nov. 19-21. In addition to Volker, Hale and Morrison, the new witness list included Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Pence; Alexander Vindman, the director for European affairs at the National Security Council; U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian Affairs Laura Cooper; and former National Security Council official Fiona Hill.

BOLTON WARNED THAT UKRAINE CALL WOULD BE A 'DISASTER,' BILL TAYLOR TESTIFIES IN CLOSED-DOOR HEARING

White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, for his part, said Tuesday he no longer plans to sue over the impeachment proceedings and will instead follow Trump's directions and decline to cooperate.

Aside from witnesses, there will also be exhibits -- lots and lots of exhibits. Democrats, at least, are expected to display excerpts from transcripts, text messages, relevant news articles and social media posts.

The Democrats reportedly have been wary of Republicans trying ""stunts"" and being argumentative in an effort to distract from the case against the president.

""By Act II, I suspect the Dancing Bears will enter the room,"" one Democratic source said. But, GOP sources downplayed the idea of guerilla tactics during the hearing.

Schiff, in a memo and open letter to colleagues on the eve of Wednesday's proceedings, outlined some of the rules -- including that members not assigned to the Intelligence Committee were not permitted to make statements or question witnesses, but were allowed to sit in the audience.

""It is important to underscore that the House’s impeachment inquiry, and the committee, will not serve as venues for any member to further the same sham investigations into the Bidens or into debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake for his personal political benefit,"" Schiff wrote.

The goal is to end the hearing by 4:30 p.m.

It's only the fourth time in American history that Congress has launched impeachment proceedings against a sitting president. Two of those — against Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton 130 years later— resulted in their impeachments, or formal charges approved by the House.

Both were acquitted by the Senate, which requires a two-thirds vote to remove a sitting president under the Constitution. The House impeaches by a majority vote.

Former President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before the House could vote to impeach him.

During Watergate, the Senate held televised hearings that served to turn public opinion against Nixon. The most sensational moments -- including the testimony of White House counsel John Dean and Sen. Howard Baker's famous question, ""What did the president know and when did he know it?"" -- occurred not during House impeachment hearings but during special Watergate hearings in the Senate.

Pelosi initially was reluctant to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. As Democrats took control of the House in January, she said impeachment would be ""too divisive"" for the country. Trump, she said, was simply ""not worth it.""

After former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s widely panned appearance on Capitol Hill in July for the end of the Russia probe, the door to impeachment proceedings seemed closed.

But, the next day, Trump got on the phone with Ukraine's leader.

We are entering an incredibly divisive moment in American history. Democrats will continue to move the factual “goalposts” and deny the president fundamental due process and fairness – bedrock constitutional principles at the foundation of our country.

Democrats in the House will cherry-pick the witnesses and thereby paint an inaccurate picture of what the president is alleged to have done.

ADAM SCHIFF, DEMOCRATS 'HAVE NOTHING ON THE PRESIDENT, TOP REPUBLICAN SAYS

There has been no witness – other than the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – that has offered a firsthand account of what President Trump did regarding Ukraine military aid and a possible investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s corruption.

The real question after this week is which side’s narrative will be stronger.

The Democrats’ allegation that the president attempted extortion or bribery (very high bar, requiring direct evidence)? Or the Republicans’ belief that the president was required through our mutual legal assistance treaty with Ukraine to request that the country look into potential corruption by Biden and his son Hunter, who was highly paid to serve on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company?

But the broader question that the American people should ask is: Is it the highest and best use of the time of the House of Representatives to spend weeks looking for any actual evidence of the president violating the law? And should the Senate be tied up for a month or so conducting a trial if the president is impeached less than one year before our next presidential election?

Should Congress instead pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade? Should our elected lawmakers take action to reduce suicides among military veterans? Should Congress help our farmers compete on the world stage and assist small businesses and entrepreneurs with a regulatory and tax burden that is quite frankly too high?

Where are statesmen and stateswomen in Congress? Why aren’t Democratic leaders speaking out against this partisan impeachment charade, knowing the permanent damage it is going to inflict on our country?

I know that America’s founders would never have imagined the situation that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, both California Democrats, have created by choosing this path to undo an election of a duly elected president of the United States.

Someone once told me early in my career that politics is a sport played with blunt instruments. We should fully expect that – if this impeachment effort has any success in hurting President Trump’s reelection in 2020 – an impeachment inquiry will be the blunt instrument of future elections.

We will not be better off as a republic if the president is impeached on a purely partisan vote in the House.

Many Democrats in the House do not come from competitive districts, and quite frankly aren’t concerned about what this impeachment will inflict on the entire country. They appear to only want to protect their left flanks from potential primary challenges.

Impeaching President Trump on completely partisan grounds is bad for our country and has a long-term consequence of being a new blunt instrument that cannot be returned to the sidelines.

Like lemmings following their leaders into the sea, rank and file Democrats in the House are following their leaders into a partisan hole that will only strengthen President Trump and his 2020 reelection. God save the Republic.

How ironic it would be if the Democratic bloodlust to destroy President Trump winds up giving him four more years as president.

Millions of Americans are asking themselves that question as the House Intelligence Committee begins televised impeachment hearings Wednesday.,2019-11-13,Fox News,"Leslie Marshall: Trump, impeachment and the future – Here's what I tell my Democratic friends",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-impeachment-future-democratic-friends-leslie-marshall,"Should President Trump be impeached?

Millions of Americans are asking themselves that question as the House Intelligence Committee begins televised impeachment hearings Wednesday. As Democrats and Republicans look at what is publicly known so far, they are coming up with dramatically different answers.

The impeachment question is like a Rorschach test – the psychological test in which people look at inkblots and tell a tester what the inkblots look like. Looking at the same inkblots, different people often see very different things.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: ELECTIONS, NOT IMPEACHMENTS ARE HOW WE RESOLVE POLICY DISPUTES IN THIS COUNTRY

A lot of evidence about what most Democrats consider Trump’s misconduct – and what most Republicans say is either OK or at least not impeachable – has already been published and broadcast. In fact, so much is out there that most people with busy lives don’t have time to keep up with it all.

But in most cases, if you ask a Democrat about the evidence known so far, he or she will say it paints a picture of an arrogant and dishonest president who abuses his power for political and personal gain and thinks he is above the law.

If you ask a Republican, he or she will most likely judge the evidence quite differently – the way two different people see very different pictures in the inkblots of the Rorschach test.

Republicans typically think Trump has done a good job in office and should stay there, leaving it to voters to determine if he should serve another four years beginning in 2021.

The Republicans say Democrats are attacking Trump because they can’t stand his policies and the way he conducts himself and want to weaken him before he runs for reelection next year – not because he’s guilty of serious wrongdoing.

And Republicans often get hung up on the process of the impeachment inquiry now being conducted by the House Intelligence Committee, rather than the substance of the accusations against Trump.

The central accusation is that Trump held up nearly $400 million in vital aid for Ukraine to pressure that nation’s president to launch an investigation of Democratic presidential contender former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.

We need to keep our different views of the Trump Rorschach test in perspective. Sometimes we simply have to agree to disagree with friends and loved ones on political issues and not let them become all-consuming.

In other words, Trump is accused of placing his own interest above our national interest, which requires America to support Ukraine against Russian military forces that have already seized control of Crimea and threaten Eastern Ukraine.

Democratic critics of Trump also accuse him of obstruction of Congress by trying to stop administration officials from testifying in the impeachment inquiry. And they criticize his repeated attacks on the anonymous whistleblower who got the impeachment inquiry started with a complaint about Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

And don’t get me started on all the other things many Democrats accuse Trump of doing – that would take up a book.

I have both Democratic and Republican friends. How do I talk to the warring camps? And how can you without hurting friendships or even marriages when the two people come out on different sides of the impeachment debate?

Americans were already divided over President Trump. The impeachment fight has widened those divides, causing arguments among friends and within families. We can anticipate plenty of heated discussions around Thanksgiving tables around the country later this month.

We need to keep our different views of the Trump Rorschach test in perspective. Sometimes we simply have to agree to disagree with friends and loved ones on political issues and not let them become all-consuming. We shouldn’t let these disagreements destroy our relationships.

When I talk to my friends of all political persuasions about impeachment, I remind them that this will almost certainly not result in kicking Donald Trump out of the White House. Impeachment is an action by a majority vote in the House charging the president with wrongdoing to warrant removal from office.

Actually removing Trump requires 67 votes after a trial in the Senate. But Democrats and allied independents only hold 47 Senate seats. Even if all vote to convict Trump, another 20 Republicans would have to join them to oust Trump from the White House. At this time that looks like it would be virtually impossible.

Polls show Americans are about evenly split on what should happen to Trump. In total, pollsters tell us about 49 percent want Trump impeached and convicted so he can be removed from office, while 46 percent oppose his impeachment and removal.

But the figures are dramatically different when broken down by political party. Some 88 percent of Democrats want Trump removed from office, but 90 percent of Republicans oppose impeachment and removal.

As the evidence mounts against Trump’s misconduct, more and more Republicans are acknowledging that the president’s actions were inappropriate – but argue that they were not impeachable. But Trump insists he did nothing wrong and says his call with the president of Ukraine was “perfect.”

Keep in mind that the House has impeached only two presidents: Andrew Johnson after the Civil War and Bill Clinton. Johnson and Clinton were acquitted in Senate trials. President Richard Nixon resigned when it seemed certain the House was about to impeach him in the Watergate scandal.

In Trump’s case, I think we will see a repeat of what we saw when Clinton and Johnson were impeached. That is, he will be impeached by the House but remain in office after the Senate fails to get 67 votes to convict him.

And keep in mind that Clinton’s approval rating jumped to 74 percent after being impeached and that Republicans then lost seats in in both the House and the Senate. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., resigned.

I don’t think the House pursuing impeachment will lead to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stepping down. And as we recently saw in the Nov. 5 elections, Democrats were not hurt by the impeachment inquiry process, especially in Virginia and Kentucky.

But Pelosi has reluctantly moved to open the impeachment inquiry. She knows it is dividing the country and she knows impeachment will need some Republican support to be seen as something other than a partisan attack on Trump.

I tell my Democratic friends that the only way to ensure that Donald Trump is removed from office and made a one-term president is with the power of their vote. They can’t rely on the impeachment process to do this for them.

Congress with its power to impeach and remove might not be able to help Democrats achieve their goal, but all Americans can certainly help elect a new president – or decide to keep Trump in office – with their votes in November 2020. This is the strength of our democracy, and it is what made American great long before any of us alive today were born."

Here's who Democrats have to thank,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gregg-jarrett-trump-impeachment-inquiry-trouble-democrats,"The clown show known as an ""impeachment inquiry"" is getting more comical and hapless by the day.

Consider the latest remark from the circus master himself, California Rep. Adam Schiff, (think Bozo, not Pennywise). The Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee says he doesn’t want Republicans turning the impeachment proceedings into a “sham.” The hilarious irony is lost on no one. Schiff has already managed to accomplish it all on his own.

At first, Schiff wanted the faux “whistleblower” who triggered the impeachment farce to testify. Then, suddenly, he didn’t. What changed? In the interim, evidence emerged that Schiff and/or his staff colluded with the “whistleblower” before the complaint was ever filed and then lied about it, earning Schiff “Four Pinocchios” from The Washington Post.

GREGG JARRETT: WHISTLEBLOWER NOT ENTITLED TO ANONYMITY — HE'S AN INFORMANT ACTING AS A DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE

The chairman now wants to conceal his own role in engineering the pretext for impeachment and his subsequent deceit. This is why he has insisted that the “whistleblower” remain anonymous, despite no such right, guarantee, privilege, or entitlement written in the law, as I explained in an earlier column. Even though the undercover informant (reportedly working for the CIA) does not qualify for whistleblower status under the law as determined by the Department of Justice, any effort by Republicans to call him as a witness will be blocked by Schiff.

But Schiff’s machinations are more malevolent than masking the key witness. Those he will call to testify are already on record dishing up prodigious plates of multiple hearsay and rank speculation. It is obvious from the released transcripts of the heretofore “super top-secret” inquisition that none of them have any firsthand knowledge of a “quid pro quo” allegedly demanded by President Trump.

For example, Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine who will testify on Wednesday, told Schiff’s committee that it was his “understanding” there was a link between U.S. security assistance and an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden. How did Taylor arrive at his opinion? He heard it through discussions with other diplomats, although there is no indication that any of these individuals had direct knowledge of anything. The chain of hearsay went something like this: the European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland told National Security Council official Tim Morrison who, in turn, told Taylor that there was a purported ""quid pro quo.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

But wait. If Sondland was the original source, where did he get his information? He initially testified that in a brief phone conversation with Trump, the president explicitly told him, “I want nothing ... I want no quid pro quo.” Sondland added that he “never” thought there was a precondition on aid. Later, he revised his testimony to state, “I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.”

Ah, yes. He ""presumed."" Reliable witnesses do not assume or presume anything. If they do, it is nothing more than supposition that should be discarded like yesterday’s trash.

My favorite purveyor of assorted hearsay is another star witness for Schiff this Wednesday. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified that he “believed” there was a “quid pro quo” after speaking to Taylor who spoke to Morrison who heard it from Sondland who, as noted, “presumed” a precondition. This is conjecture built on triple hearsay. It is not evidence, it is junk. If this were a court of law, the presiding judge would instruct the jury to disregard such testimony and strike it from the record.

The Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee says he doesn’t want Republicans turning the impeachment proceedings into a “sham.” The hilarious irony is lost on no one. Adam Schiff has already managed to accomplish it all on his own.

Under cross-examination, these witnesses readily admitted they had no firsthand knowledge of the president’s intent during his telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They simply propagated and repeated rumors and innuendo in their diplomatic echo chamber. But that has not stopped Schiff from pretending that they are valued witnesses. With the chairman’s encouragement and guidance, they have offered their interpretations of the Trump-Zelensky conversation. It reminds me of Schiff’s own dramatic interpretation of the phone call, which was nothing more than an unconscionable fabrication designed to smear Trump.

A transcript of the real conversation is the best evidence of what actually occurred. Indeed, it is the only relevant and material evidence. Nowhere is there a demand, condition, or pressure for a “quid pro quo” that made an investigation of the Bidens contingent on U.S. military assistance. This is corroborated by Zelensky who is on record stating that there was no blackmail involved and no pressure applied. “Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said. “We had a great phone call,” he added. “It was normal.”

The Ukrainian government has confirmed that it was unaware that U.S. aid had been temporarily suspended until almost five weeks after the call with Trump. As noted in my previous column, it is impossible for there to be a “quid pro quo” when the recipient of the “quid” is oblivious to the existence of the ""quo.""

In the court of public opinion, Schiff increasingly reveals himself to be the court jester playing the fool. He presides over an investigatory charade that is anathema to fundamental fairness and due process.

If the inquiry was equitable, both sides would be able to call their own witnesses. Yet, the House of Representatives passed its impeachment measure giving Schiff the right to veto GOP witnesses. He has already made it clear that he will do so, rejecting a request that the faux “whistleblower” testify. It is clear that other witnesses, including Schiff and/or his staff, will also be rejected.

To his credit, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has made it clear that if the unidentified informant who precipitated the impeachment ""witch hunt"" is not allowed to testify in the House, “this thing is dead on arrival in the Senate.”

In truth, it was DOA the moment Schiff was put in charge of this clown show.

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters.

In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent.

Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent.

Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).

The top picks among Hispanics are Sanders (31 percent) and Biden (24 percent), with Warren a distant third (10 percent). Buttigieg garners 1 percent.

Self-identified liberals prefer Biden (25 percent) and Warren (25 percent) over Sanders (18 percent) and Buttigieg (10 percent). Moderates and conservatives like Biden (24 percent) and Sanders (18 percent), with no others hitting double digits.

Sanders is the clear choice for those under age 45, while those 45 and over go for Biden.

CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS

Nominating a candidate who can beat Trump (74 percent extremely important) is far more important to Nevada Democratic voters than one who shares their views on major issues (41 percent extremely important). Biden is the number one choice among both of those groups.

Caucusgoers split 46-46 percent between wanting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach. Legacy voters go heavily for Biden, while those wanting a new approach give a slight edge to Sanders.

More Warren backers (67 percent) are extremely interested in the election than those supporting Biden (62 percent) and Sanders (47 percent).

On the other hand, Biden (70 percent) and Sanders (70 percent) have more “strong” supporters than Warren (61 percent).

Nevada’s February 22 Democratic caucus is 100 days away, soon after elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Fifty-three percent of Nevada voters rate the economy positively, including 22 percent calling it excellent. For comparison, 14 percent of voters nationally rate the economy as excellent.

Meanwhile, more disapprove (52 percent) than approve (45 percent) of the job Trump is doing. His 45 percent approval roughly matches his 2016 vote share, as Hillary Clinton won the Silver State 48-46 percent.

Women help drive Trump’s job rating underwater: 38 percent approve and 60 percent disapprove. Men approve by 53-43 percent, resulting in a 32-point gender gap.

Forty-three percent of Nevadans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached but not removed, and 46 percent oppose impeachment altogether.

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings on impeachment Wednesday.

Despite Trump’s negative job rating, he remains competitive in potential matchups tested. Both Biden (47-40) and Sanders (47-40) have a 7-point advantage over Trump (outside the poll’s margin of error), and Warren is up by 3 (44-41). Buttigieg and Trump tie at 41 percent each. No candidate hits 50 percent and 13-18 percent are undecided or would back a third-party candidate.

Biden and Sanders do better against Trump in large part because of stronger support among men and Hispanics. Among men, Trump bests Biden by 5 points and Sanders by 4, yet he leads Warren by 12 points. Hispanics pick Biden and Sanders over Trump by 26 points, while Warren’s advantage is 18 points.

“These results reinforce the notion that Nevada remains a battleground state,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “But the state’s underlying demographic changes make it challenging for Republicans.”

Warren and Buttigieg are likely hurt by some voters believing it is too soon for a woman (17 percent) or a gay president (41 percent).

Majorities of Nevada voters say the country is ready to elect a female president (76 percent), a Jewish president (67 percent), and a Latino/Hispanic president (67 percent). Views split 46-41 percent over electing a gay or lesbian.

Among Democrats: 83 percent feel the United States is ready to elect a woman president, 68 percent a Jewish leader, 68 percent a Latino/Hispanic candidate, and 53 percent a gay president.

While about two-thirds of Republicans say the country would elect a candidate who is female (66 percent), Jewish (67 percent) or Latino/Hispanic (65 percent), over half think the country isn’t ready for a gay president (35 yes vs. 51 no).

Conducted November 10-13, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,506 Nevada voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. Respondents were randomly selected from a statewide voter file, and 627 were screened to identify potential participants in the Democratic caucus. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for all registered voters and plus or minus 4 points for Democratic caucusgoers."

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY A 'THREAT TO THE PRESIDENCY,' GRAHAM SAYS

If the House votes to impeach President Trump, Graham's committee would play a key role in a Senate trial.

""Here's the question I have about the whistleblower: 'Was the whistleblower connected to Joe Biden in any way?'"" — Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

""Did the whistleblower get himself or herself? ... Did the whistleblower engage in an effort to get the [former] Ukrainian president, Poroshenko, to weigh in and stop the investigation of this gas company? Was there a connection between the whistleblower, Biden, Biden's effort to call Ukraine?""

The South Carolina Republican added the Trump impeachment inquiry cannot be ""legitimized"" if it is based on an anonymous source.

""If you do that, no president will be allowed to survive,"" he said.

""And to my fellow members of Congress, how would you like to be in the shoes of Donald Trump? You're accused of something based on a whistleblower who is anonymous and you can't call witnesses on your behalf.""

He also reiterated his view that legitimizing the impeachment inquiry in its current state would endanger the office of the presidency going forward.

On Tuesday, Graham told ""Hannity"" the allegation President Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukrainian officials is also not true.

""I think it would be a danger to the presidency in the future for us to legitimize what's going on in the House,"" he said.

IMPEACHMENT HEARING TESTIMONY DETAILS TRUMP PURSUIT OF UKRAINE 'INVESTIGATIONS,' AS GOP DECRIES 'SHAM' PROBE

Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings in the House delivered a stark account Wednesday of Trump's pursuit of political ""investigations"" in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani's alleged meddling in that country. For their part, Republicans panned the entire process as a ""low-rent Ukrainian sequel"" to the Russia collusion case and hit back at the claims as mere “hearsay.”

""You can't just lose the leverage of U.S. national security. It's not money. This is not a business deal,"" Williams said. ""This is the president representing us and saying, 'I want to use American dollars to get dirt on my political opponent.'""

Co-host Greg Gutfeld weighed in, defending Trump and emphasizing that ""leverage"" is always implied when it comes to people of power and then making the point a joke at co-host Dana Perino's expense.

""The fact is you can't turn off leverage when you're a boss. It's implied whether you say it or not,"" Gutfeld said. ""Dana, when you ask your assistant for a sandwich, you don't say, 'Can I have a sandwich or, or else?' The 'or else' is implied because you're a monster.""

HERE'S WHAT TO EXPECT DURING PUBLIC HEARING

Giuliani wrote that Trump’s call with Zelensky was “innocent” and “proper,” and Trump was simply asking him to investigate “allegations of corruption at the highest levels of both governments” when he suggested Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's activities in the country.

GIULIANI ASSOCIATE TOLD UKRAINIANS TO INVESTIGATE BIDENS, LAWYER SAYS

He said the push for Zelensky to investigate was simply an “exercise of Mr. Trump’s responsibility as U.S. president.”

Giuliani wrote that Trump and Zelensky discussed alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, including documents related to Paul Manafort released by a Ukrainian lawmaker and the National Anti-Corruption Bureau that were purportedly meant to hurt Trump’s candidacy.

He added that Trump “briefly” brought up the Bidens’ conduct regarding the Ukrainian oil company Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board, and said he thinks the former vice president should be investigated for bribery over allegations of a $900,000 transfer from Burisma to a lobbying firm owned by Hunter Biden “and at the very least both Bidens’ behavior deserves serious scrutiny.”

Giuliani said Trump’s words during the phone call were free of “threat or coercion” and noted that Zelensky said publicly that he didn’t feel any pressure to investigate the Bidens.

“[O]ut of a five-page transcript Mr. Trump spent only six lines on Joe Biden,” Giuliani added.

He wrote that the left’s inability to accept Trump's 2016 win and ""fear"" of his policies have pushed Democrats into a “frenzy” and the ""double standard"" of the impeachment inquiry.

“[I]f the allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden aren’t fully investigated, we won’t have equal justice under the law,” Giuliani concluded.

The first public impeachment hearings will begin Wednesday morning."

Graham told ""Hannity"" on Tuesday the allegation President Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukrainian officials is also not true.

""I think it would be a danger to the presidency in the future for us to legitimize what's going on in the House,"" he said.

HISTORIC TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS SET TO BEGIN AS DEMS PREDICT 'PHENOMENAL WEEK'

Graham was referring to the situation that, to-date, has not allowed Trump or members of his administration to engage in proceedings. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has also not yet approved Republicans' request to have the whistleblower testify publicly.

Speaking with Sean Hannity, Graham said every American -- including the president of the United States -- has the right to confront their accuser.

""That's not being done in this case, so I don't want to legitimize this because it's a threat to the presidency,"" he said.

He added he did not believe there was evidence confirming allegations lodged against Trump relating to Ukraine.

""The allegation is that Donald J. Trump withheld aid to Ukraine unless the Ukrainian government investigated Joe Biden and Hunter Biden for corruption,"" he said.

""The problem with that allegation is that it's not true. The aid was delivered to the Ukrainian government and there was no investigation of Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.""

In addition, Graham remarked that the Trump proceedings are not the first impeachment investigation he's been a part of.

In the late 1990s while serving as a U.S. congressman from Upstate South Carolina, Graham was involved in House proceedings against then-President Bill Clinton.

""Yeah, I've done this before,"" he remarked."

Jordan chides diplomat on quid pro quo claims: ‘Your clear understanding was obviously wrong’,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jordan-diplomat-clear-understanding,"Republican Rep. Jim Jordan led some of the toughest questioning during Wednesday's impeachment hearing, challenging Ukraine ambassador William Taylor over his claims that he understood President Trump to be holding up aid and more as he sought to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce a Biden-related probe.

Taylor has said he had a ""clear"" understanding that the release of aid to Ukraine was linked to a request for investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company that counted the younger Biden as a board member. Jordan brought up three meetings that Taylor had with Zelensky between the time the aid was delayed and eventually released, and Taylor confirmed that ""there was not discussion of linkage"" during any of them.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HEARINGS BEGIN: LIVE BLOG

""Now, with all due respect, Ambassador, your clear understanding was obviously wrong,"" Jordan said, noting that Zelensky also never made any announcement of an investigation prior to Trump releasing the aid on Sept. 11, 2019.

Taylor then gave a further explanation of what his ""clear understanding"" was based on.

""As I testified, Mr. Jordan, this came from Ambassador [Gordon] Sondland,” Taylor said, recalling that Sondland told him that he said to Zelensky, ""that while this was not a quid pro quo, if Mr. Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate.”

Taylor also referred to how Sondland ""told me that it was a mistake to have told the Ukrainians that only the meeting with the president in the Oval Office was held up in order to get these investigations. No, it was not just the meeting, it was also the security assistance.""

Jordan, who was only recently added to the House Intelligence Committee that is holding the hearing, pointed to an addendum to Sondland's closed-door testimony, in which he discussed how Taylor recalled that he mentioned a linkage between the investigation and the release of aid to Ukraine.

""Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I had conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky,"" Jordan read out loud from Sondland's statement.

“We got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding,” Jordan said. ""And you're their star witness.""

Trump campaign press secretary Kayleigh McEnany seized on the moment, using it to argue against Taylor's understanding of social media.

Sondland responded ""that I don’t consider myself a star witness or anything,"" and that ""my understanding is only coming from people that I talked to.""

He explained that the confusing nature of Sondland's clarification was ""because he said he didn't remember this,"" but Taylor believes that Sondland's recollection is similar to his own.

""The way I read this, he remembers it the same way I do,"" Taylor said."

Patrick, the former two-term governor of neighboring Massachusetts, said that he’s “a big, big fan of Joe Biden.”

But he noted that the former vice president’s “deep, deep, public empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

DEVAL PATRICK MAKES LATE ENTRY INTO 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

And he took another dig at Biden’s emphasis on ousting President Trump and returning to the normalcy of his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president.

""The instinct that his campaign seems to have to say, to project in effect ‘if we just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent, we can just go back to doing what we used to do,’ misses the moment,"" Patrick argued.

The late entry into the race by Patrick could present a threat to the former vice president. It appears Patrick will run a center-left campaign, fighting for the same voters that Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been successfully courting. And he could give Biden a fight in the former vice president’s early voting state stronghold of South Carolina, where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate.

Patrick could also pose problems for fellow Bay Stater Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts is now a co-front-runner in the polls alongside Biden, with Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also part of the top tier of candidates in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I want to acknowledge my friendship and my enormous respect, in particular with Senator Warren,"" Patrick told Fox News. ""I talked to her last night and I think it was a kind of hard conversation for both of us frankly.”

Asked about the government-run programs that Warren and Sanders are proposing, such as ""Medicare-for-all,"" Patrick praised both of the populist Democratic standard-bearers but added: “I think that if we want solutions that last, they can’t be solutions that feel to the voting public as if they are just Democratic solutions.”

Despite his criticisms of Warren and Biden, Patrick insisted he didn’t want to play the role of a political pundit and emphasized: “Let me be clear about a ground rule for me going forward. I am not trying to climb up by trying to pull anyone else down.”

Patrick also told reporters that he wouldn’t object to an outside group – such as a super PAC that can accept unlimited contributions – assisting his campaign.

“It would be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” he said. “I wish it weren’t so. I wish campaigns weren’t as expensive and I wish that the influence of money that we’ve seen in Washington wasn’t as great as it is.”

Biden has been criticized by many of his rivals for not speaking out against a newly formed super PAC that’s hoping to raise millions of dollars on behalf of the former vice president’s White House bid.

Patrick acknowledged that joining the race late – Iowa kicks off the nominating calendar on Feb. 3, followed eight days later by New Hampshire – presents high hurdles.

“It’s a big and talented field,"" he said. ""It’s hard to break through not just because it’s this stage in the elections, in the campaigns, but it’s hard to break through without being a celebrity or sensational and I’m neither of those things.”

But he highlighted that “voters all across the country in some cases are just tuning in and in many cases haven’t made their decisions.”

And Patrick – a long-shot who went on to win the Massachusetts governorship in the 2006 election – emphasized that “I understand what we have to do but you know what, I’ve lived a political life and I would say as a black man, a whole life dealing with skepticism.”

Patrick served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under President Bill Clinton. After serving his two terms as governor, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Patrick’s tenure at the firm will likely be in the spotlight in the 2020 race.

Asked about the liability, Patrick told reporters “I smile because when I was co-chair of the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012 and there was all the attacks on Bain Capital on account of Mitt Romney, I was asked about that and I didn’t buy it then and I don’t buy it now.

The former governor mulled launching a presidential campaign last year, assembling a team of advisers and enjoying the backing of some of former President Barack Obama’s top political aides. But late last year, Patrick announced he wouldn’t run, pointing to the “cruelty of our elections process.”

Patrick said “I was ready to go last year… we got really, really close.” But he noted that just two weeks before Thanksgiving, his wife Diane was diagnosed with uterine cancer “and it’s the sort of thing that brings you right back to earth and I felt that the right thing to do for her, for us, was to focus on that.”

He explained that his wife is now cancer free."

That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters.

In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided.

Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.

“As North Carolina has grown in recent years, it’s developed into one of the most competitive states in the country,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who partners with Democrat Chris Anderson on the Fox News Poll. “It’s difficult to think of a scenario where Trump wins re-election without carrying the state.”

Roughly equal numbers of North Carolina voters approve (47 percent) of Trump’s job performance as disapprove (50 percent).

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 3 percent say impeached but not removed, and 47 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (89 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor (79 percent).

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings Wednesday.

Turning to the Democratic race, strong support among African American voters gives Biden a commanding lead in North Carolina’s primary, which will be held March 3, 2020.

Overall, Biden captures 37 percent among Democratic primary voters, more than double the support of any competitor. Warren receives 15 percent and Sanders 14 percent.

Buttigieg garners 6 percent and Kamala Harris 4 percent. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang stand at 2 percent apiece. Michael Bennett, Steve Bullock, and Amy Klobuchar each receive 1 percent.

About half of black voters support Biden (49 percent). That’s more than 30 points higher than Warren and Sanders (12 percent each).

Biden also leads among voters over age 65 (+39 points), moderates (+20), and whites (+11).

The only group Warren wins is self-described “very liberals,” and even here she narrowly tops Sanders (by 4 points) and Biden (by 5 points).

Sanders’ only win is among voters under age 35, where he bests Biden by 10.

“Polling outside of the early states illustrates what broad goodwill Democratic primary voters have for Biden, especially among black voters,” says Anderson. “Places where campaigning is currently less intense, he starts with a built-in advantage that could pay dividends once the primaries move beyond the early states.”

North Carolina Democrats split 45-45 percent when choosing between a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach.

Biden is the favorite by 29 points among those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy and by 14 points for those favoring a new approach.

Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democratic primary voters say it is extremely important to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump compared to 41 percent who feel it is extremely important the nominee shares their views on major issues.

North Carolina Senate

By a 40-35 percent margin, North Carolina voters approve of the job Republican incumbent Thom Tillis is doing as their senator. One in four (25 percent) is unsure, including 22 percent of Republicans.

Elected in 2014, Tillis is facing two challengers in the senate primary. He leads with the support of 54 percent of GOP primary voters, while Garland Tucker receives 11 percent and Sandy Smith 4 percent. Twenty-six percent are undecided and 5 percent say other.

Things are more uncertain on the other side, as the three declared Democrats are all under 20 percent: Erica Smith receives 18 percent, Cal Cunningham 13 percent, and Trevor Fuller 10 percent. Most Democratic primary voters are undecided (49 percent) or say they will support someone else (10 percent).

Is the U.S. electorate an equal opportunity employer? Two-thirds of North Carolina voters think the country is ready to elect a woman president. That drops to 54 percent for a Jewish president, 49 percent a Latino/Hispanic president, and 30 percent a gay/lesbian president.

By a 24-point margin, more Democrats than Republicans believe the nation is ready for a woman president. Democrats are also more likely to say Americans are ready to elect someone who is Jewish (by 7 points), Latino/Hispanic (by 11 points), or gay (by 17 points).

""I thought Ambassador Taylor said it best, which was that the shakedown scheme by the president was just wrong, but that they don't have dogs in the fight. They're career public servants. They've served all over the world.""

THE IMPEACHMENT HEARING WITNESSES: WHO IS BILL TAYLOR?

Kent and Taylor testified on the opening day of public impeachment inquiry hearings and delivered a stark account of President Trump's pursuit of political ""investigations"" in Ukraine, as well as Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's alleged meddling in U.S. policy toward the Eastern European nation, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ""low-rent Ukrainian sequel"" to the Russia investigation and hit back at the claims as mere “hearsay.”

Swalwell said if the president is ""innocent"" he would send acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton to testify.

""If the president of the United States is innocent, he will send the firsthand witnesses, John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, to Congress,"" Swalwell said. ""If he's guilty, they'll stop us from hearing it, hard stop.""

""What about executive privilege?"" MacCallum asked. ""Those people obviously work very closely with the president.""

""Executive privilege does not cover wrongdoing or crimes. It certainly does not cover people who are no longer in the White House. And we're talking to other people who were not the president,"" Swalwell said. ""You know, again, [for] the president, the interest here is not executive privilege, it's CYA.""

Swalwell also dismissed the idea of investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's involvement with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.

""I don't think we should chase the president's conspiracy theories, especially when Mr. Kent said Mr. Biden was only carrying out the foreign policy of the United States,"" Swalwell said.

MacCallum pressed the congressman as to whether or not he would investigate an offspring of President Trump if the situation was similar.

For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. And he released a video declaring: ""They're trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you. And I'll never let that happen.""

Fireworks sparked from the very opening of the hearing, as GOP Rep. Devin Nunes accused Democrats of running a ""scorched earth war"" against the president. Republicans also ripped into Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., after the Democrat interrupted GOP questioning to say a witness should be ""cautious"" about answering questions that assume facts not in evidence before him.

But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.

THE IMPEACHMENT HEARING WITNESSES: WHO IS BILL TAYLOR?

Notably, Taylor testified, for the first time, that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about “the investigations,” to which Sondland responded that “the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.”

Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine.

“Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,” Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. “At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.”

This conversation would have taken place a day after the now-famous phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he sought a probe into alleged Ukraine interference in the 2016 election and of Joe Biden's role in ousting a prosecutor who had been looking into Burisma, where son Hunter Biden had a lucrative role on the board. Taylor made clear it was his understanding the term ""investigations"" indeed referred to the Biden family and Burisma. Trump is accused of not only pressing Kiev to look into those issues, but potentially linking that request to U.S. military aid for Ukraine, something Trump denies.

Taylor's testimony would offer another account linking Trump to the pursuit of those probes, and to Giuliani's controversial involvement abroad. Taylor also repeated his prior closed-door testimony that he understood critical U.S. aid was being held up, along with a Zelensky White House meeting, over the investigation issue. However, the newly revealed phone call did not by itself address any quid pro quo.

THE IMPEACHMENT HEARING WITNESSES: WHO IS GEORGE KENT?

""The security assistance—not just the White House meeting—was conditioned on the investigations,"" he said he was told.

Republicans sought to undercut the Democratic case by saying the Ukraine aid was ultimately released without any of the investigations sought by Trump, arguing that shows no quid pro quo took place.

Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan referenced three separate meetings Ukraine’s president held with U.S. officials, saying there’s no evidence participants discussed the “linkage” of security assistance dollars in return for an investigation of the Bidens. Taylor confirmed that’s the case.

Jordan also got Taylor to acknowledge he’s never met Trump and stressed that Zelensky did not announce the investigations, saying, “Your clear understanding was obviously wrong, because it didn’t happen.”

Republicans were quick to point out that Taylor was not providing first-hand information. At one point, Taylor said, “I don’t know what President or candidate Trump was thinking about the Ukrainians.”

During one combative exchange, Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe asked the diplomats if they believe Trump committed an impeachable offense. Neither would say. “That’s not what either of us are here to do,"" Taylor said. ""This is your job.”

The White House further argued that Taylor offered ""hearsay of hearsay"" and accused House Democrats of basing ""this entire sham on what amounts to a game of telephone.""

Republicans also lamented that Democrats aren’t allowing the anonymous whistleblower who filed the complaint that ignited the inquiry to testify, with Jordan saying they should have ""the person who started it."" A Democrat on the committee, Vermont Rep. Peter Welch, shot back: ""I'd like to see the person who started it come testify: President Trump.""

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., also asked both men if they are ""Never Trumpers"" as Trump has claimed. Both men denied it.

Meanwhile, during Kent’s testimony, he clarified that while he had raised concerns of a conflict of interest over Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings during February 2015, he did not see any effort from U.S. officials to protect that firm from criticism or investigation.

“My concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent said during questioning from Republicans. Kent also said he would like to see Ukraine investigate other accusations involving a corrupt prosecutor and Burisma.

Both officials voiced concerns about the involvement of Giuliani. Kent alleged he was trying to ""gin up politically motivated investigations."" Taylor said Giuliani and others were involved in a ""highly irregular"" diplomatic channel in Ukraine that eventually diverged with the more formal channel.

Meanwhile, Schiff outlined the parameters of the impeachment inquiry, questioning whether the president sought to condition official acts and “exploit” Ukraine’s “vulnerability” for personal political gain.

“The matter is as simple and as terrible as that,” Schiff said Wednesday. “Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief.”

Schiff described the core of the impeachment inquiry, and said: “If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?”

But committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., staunchly defended the president and his actions, blasting Democrats for their “scorched earth war against President Trump” and calling the impeachment inquiry a “carefully orchestrated media smear campaign.”

Prior to Schiff swearing in the witnesses, Republicans including Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Jordan challenged Schiff to schedule a hearing with the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry. They also accused Schiff of being the only member of the House, along with his staff, to know the identity of the whistleblower.

Schiff fired back, saying that he does not know the identity of that individual -- though his staff has had contact with the whistleblower.

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, meanwhile, blasted the hearing as a ""sham"" and ""colossal waste of taxpayer time & money.""

For the Democrats, Daniel Goldman and Daniel Noble, both counsels for the Intelligence Committee, were tapped to handle portions of questioning. On the Republican side, Steve Castor, whom Jordan brought over from the Oversight Committee, will be the counsel to pose questions for the minority.

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelensky. That phone call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

Zelensky, though, has said he felt no pressure during the call. The White House has maintained no wrongdoing, with the president calling the call “perfect” and arguing that it contained “no quid pro quo.”

The whistleblower’s complaint also stated their concerns that Trump was soliciting a foreign power to influence the 2020 presidential election – a concern that Taylor directly testified to privately last month.

Taylor, during his closed-door deposition, testified that he “understood that the reason for investigating Burisma was to cast Vice President Biden in a bad light.” Taylor added that it would benefit “a political campaign for the reelection of President Trump.”

Meanwhile, Schiff has already teed up three days of additional public hearings next week which, among other witnesses, includes three sought by Republicans—ex-National Security Council official Tim Morrison, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, and high-ranking State Department official David Hale.

Republican lawmakers have sought a slew of other witnesses, including Hunter Biden and the whistleblower, but it is not yet clear whether any will be permitted to testify by Democrats on the committee as part of the inquiry."

The heads of three House committees -- Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs.-- are currently leading the investigation into whether Trump prodded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into former Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, his son Hunter and their business ties in Ukraine in exchange for military aid.

HISTORIC TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS SET TO BEGIN, AS DEMS PREDICT 'PHENOMENAL WEEK'

With the bang of a gavel, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will open the impeachment hearings Wednesday into Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate the 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden's dealings in the country.

The former vice president has boasted about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, as his son Hunter Biden held a lucrative role board of a Ukrainian natural gas company despite having little relevant expertise.

“There’s no due process, the president’s attorney is not in the room, cannot cross-examine, we can not have our witnesses, we can’t have a whistleblower who this all started from, an individual who was not even on the phone call,” McCarthy said.

A whistleblower's complaint about Trump's July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ignited the impeachment investigation. During the hearing Wednesday, a key exchange during that 30-minute call, which has been outlined in a Sept. 24 transcript released by the White House, could take center stage. Zelensky has said he felt no pressure during the call.

That is almost certain to remain the case at the conclusion of impeachment proceedings against President Trump that began public hearings Wednesday in the House of Representatives.

President Richard Nixon would likely have been removed in the Watergate scandal if he was impeached by the House and went on trial in the Senate, but he resigned in 1974 to avoid that.

Only two presidents have been impeached by the House – Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998, but both were acquitted when they went on trial in the Senate. At this time, this looks to be the likely outcome of impeachment proceedings against Trump.

If Trump’s impeachment ends without removal by the Senate – following the pattern of Johnson and Clinton – Democrats could be blamed for dragging the nation through a futile ordeal to remove Trump and then lose seats in the 2020 elections – as Republicans did after failing to convict Clinton.

RNC CHAIR MCDANIEL: AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING, DEMOCRATS PURSUE DELUDED DREAM TO OVERTURN TRUMP’S ELECTION

In the televised impeachment hearings that began in the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday, we saw two distinguished and long-serving U.S. diplomats – acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent – carefully and unemotionally describe what they witnessed.

We saw a few minor squabbles between Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican committee members who questioned his exclusion of their witnesses and lines of questioning.

But overall the hearings were relatively monotonous and made little progress on substance.

Few people will have changed their minds after watching all six hours of Wednesday’s testimony.

The facts remain the same.

On July 25, President Trump made a phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the course of the conversation, Trump asked for “a favor,” according to a rough transcript released by the White House.

The favor? That Zelensky investigate why Ukrainian prosecutors had not investigated the appointment of the unqualified Hunter Biden (son of then-Vice President Joe Biden) to a cushy spot on the board of the Burisma natural gas firm – reportedly at a salary of about $50,000 per month.

The Trump White House temporarily delayed nearly $400 million in U.S. foreign and military aid to Ukraine until the public announcement of the investigations. But the Ukrainians never announced or conducted such investigations, and the White House eventually released the funds. As a result, Trump provided far more effective assistance for Ukraine’s struggle against Russian aggression than the administration of President Barack Obama ever did.

Most of this story is already widely known, thanks to Democratic legislative malpractice. House Intelligence Committee Democrats had conducted depositions of Kent, Taylor and others behind closed doors, with little participation by the minority Republicans.

But Democrats then released their witnesses’ written testimony, after earlier leaking the high points of the questioning. With no new testimony, and all civil servants doing their best to be bland and nonpartisan (which, after all, is their job), the hearings Wednesday primarily only repeated what the news media had already published and broadcast.

The Wednesday televised hearing also provided few critical facts because of the White House’s decision to release the rough transcript of the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call, which reduced much of the public testimony to providing color and context to facts already known.

Take, for example, the “news” that Taylor had learned from staff of an overheard July 26 phone call between Trump and America’s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland. Trump allegedly asked Sondland about the “investigations,” and Sondland reportedly replied that the Ukrainians were “ready to move forward.”

When the aide asked Sondland what Trump thought of Ukraine, the ambassador reportedly replied that Trump cares “more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,” referring to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But this should come as no surprise.

The July 25 transcript already made clear that Trump cared enough about the investigations to raise the issue directly with President Zelensky.

And the already unreliable Sondland, who has had to correct his testimony and may be in the habit of exaggerating his role, added another level of hearsay to the tale. This made front-page headlines.

Unfortunately, the public hearings and the news coverage have focused on these marginal developments and have ignored the central question: do these facts justify President Trump’s impeachment and removal from office?

Impeachment is a two-step process.

First the House starts the process by impeaching the president on a charge of treason, bribery, or other “high Crimes” or “misdemeanors.” This is akin to bringing a criminal charge.

If a president is impeached – as happened with Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton – the Constitution says the Senate has “the sole power to try” the case. The constitutional text underscores that the Senate plays a judicial role by including the word “try,” requiring the chief justice of the United States to preside at the president’s trial, and referring to “the Party convicted” if the Senate decides to remove the president from office.

Removal requires an affirmative vote by two-thirds of the senators present. If all 100 senators vote, that amounts to 67 votes needed to remove a president from office. Democrats and independents aligned with them control 47 seats in the Senate – meaning they would need the support of at least 20 Republican senators to remove Trump from office.

It seems clear that the type of conduct at issue here involving President Trump and Ukraine could supply the grounds for impeachment. The framers of the Constitution openly worried about a president who might use his foreign affairs powers for personal or political gain.

The framers had seen France’s King Louis XIV pay Britain’s King Charles II to remain neutral in the European wars. They believed that “high crimes and misdemeanors” – the grounds for impeachment and removal of a president – included abuse of the executive’s control over foreign policy.

But our nation’s founders also believed that impeachment should only come as a last resort. They expected that the American people would hold a president accountable for any abuses of power at the ballot box.

“At the end of four years, [the president] may be turned out of his office,” Gov. Edmund Randolph said during the 1788 Virginia convention called to ratify the Constitution. “If he misbehaves he may be impeached, and in this case he will never be reelected.”

Defenders of the Constitution designed impeachment to be a rare event, especially by making the requirement for removal a two-thirds vote of the Senate for treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors, rather than “maladministration,” in their words.

The Federalists worried that the president otherwise would become too dependent on a Congress eager to use impeachment to fight political and partisan disputes.

It is on this point where the House impeachment hearings have proven so disappointing. House Democrats have not shown why a quid pro quo that never succeeded (assuming the facts in the worst light for the White House) and that involved a relatively small country at the periphery of American security interests should justify removal of a president, the undoing of the results of the 2016 election, and the preemption of the people’s verdict on Trump in 2020."

Castro and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas are two candidates who debated last month who will not appear on the debate stage for the next round next week. Castro failed to meet the threshold requirements set forth by Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, while O’Rourke dropped out of the race last month.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and author Marianne Williamson also failed to qualify.

This month, candidates were required to have reached 3 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls since Sept. 13 or 5 percent in two early-nominating state polls since that date, while collecting contributions from at least 165,000 unique donors -- with at least 600 each in a minimum of 20 states.

CASTRO LAYS OFF STAFF IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA

Some candidates have criticized Perez for what they've viewed as overly stringent requirements. Some argue that the donor emphasis has forced them to spend disproportionately for online fundraising efforts that drain resources they could be using to reach voters in other ways.

Perez says hopefuls have had ample time to demonstrate their supporter, both in polls and through small-dollar contributors, and that any Democrat falling short this far into the campaign almost certainly isn’t positioned to win the nomination or defeat President Trump in November 2020.

Perez has announced even stiffer requirements for a Dec. 19 debate. The polling marks:4 percent in four national polls or 6 percent in two early state polls taken after Oct. 16. The donor threshold: 200,000 unique donors, with at least 800 from each of 20 states.

The top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- are not threatened by those goals. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have met them as well.

But the higher targets put pressure on several other candidates to broaden their support or risk falling out of any reasonable contention with less than three months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.

Public Trump impeachment hearings set to begin, as Dems predict 'phenomenal week'

In a pillared House chamber at 10 a.m. ET Wednesday, in the shadow of the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, House Democrats are set to host the first public hearing involving the potential impeachment of a president since Nov. 19, 1998 -- and, they insist, they aren't happy about it. However, behind the scenes, House Democrats were predicting a ""phenomenal week,"" Fox News is told.

At the same time, Republicans have been preparing a methodical and vigorous cross-examination of Democrats' witnesses, whose accounts of President Trump's alleged wrongdoing have been based largely on hearsay and intuition, critics say.

The allegations: With the bang of a gavel, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will open the impeachment hearings Wednesday into Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden's dealings in the country. The former vice president has boasted about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, as his son Hunter Biden held a lucrative role board of a Ukrainian natural gas company despite having little relevant expertise.

An anonymous whistleblower's complaint about Trump's July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ignited the impeachment investigation. During the hearing Wednesday, a key exchange during that 30-minute call, which has been outlined in a Sept. 24 transcript released by the White House, is expected to take center stage. Democrats say Trump wanted the investigations in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. The president, Democrats allege, tried to use the power of his office to pressure a foreign government into helping him politically.

Zelensky has said he felt no pressure during the call. Trump has said the call was ""perfect"" and contained no ""quid pro quo,"" or this for that.

Shortly after Schiff's gavel, he and intelligence panel ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are to begin the questioning. They get 45 minutes each or can designate staff attorneys to ask the questions. Members of the panel will then get five minutes each to question witnesses, alternating between Republicans and Democrats.

Key Witnesses: Democrats chose Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe, to kick off the public hearings. The two likely will describe the foreign policy toward Ukraine led by Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and other White House officials.

Democrats also told Fox News that Taylor had ""the best view of the scheme. He is a habitual note-taker. He is your worst nightmare. Very prepared."" Still, Taylor wasn’t on the phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Fox News is told Republicans will cross-examine Taylor repeatedly over his lack of ""first-hand knowledge"" about the call.

Kent, a career foreign service officer, testified Oct. 15 there were three words Trump wanted to hear from the Ukraine president: ""Investigations, Biden and Clinton."" He also told the investigators about the ""campaign"" of smears Giuliani led against former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. That led to her being recalled from the position. Yovanovitch is set to testify Friday. Click here for more on our top story.

Trump, Erdogan set to meet at White House with tension running high

President Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will meet Wednesday amid a strained relationship between the two NATO allies. Turkey has rebuffed the U.S. and is turning toward Russia on security issues and Ankara is facing a Washington backlash over attacks on Kurdish civilians during its incursion into Syria last month.

Erdogan and Trump face an agenda that includes Turkey's decision to buy a Russian air defense system and its attack on U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria. On Tuesday, the Turkish leader issued a chilling threat to Europe over looming sanctions over Ankara's unauthorized drilling in the Mediterranean: penalize us and we'll release ISIS prisoners back to European countries.

IMPEACHMENT SHOW DEBUTS

Fox News: “Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings delivered a stark account Wednesday of President Trump’s pursuit of political ‘investigations’ in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani’s alleged meddling in that country, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ‘low-rent Ukrainian sequel’ to the Russia collusion case. For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. … But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.”



GOP Senators skip - AP: “Millions of Americans are expected to watch on live TV Wednesday as the House kicks off public hearings on whether to impeach President Donald Trump. Just don’t expect many Republican senators to be among them, if a quick sampling of them is to be believed. Of eight Senate Republicans questioned Tuesday evening, seven said they wouldn’t watch Wednesday’s start of the Democratic-led process or suggested it wasn’t a priority. ‘Tomorrow I’m going to be paying attention to what we’re doing in the Senate,’ said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said he’d be chairing an Environment and Public Works Committee session.”



What will impeachment mean for 2020 Dems? - Politico: “The degree to which the Democrats in Congress who are running the impeachment inquiry are disconnected from their colleagues running for president cannot be overstated. Impeachment and the presidential primary are like two planets slowly pulled together by gravity that are finally about to collide — nobody seems to know who will survive impact. … ‘This is kind of like if Roland Emmerich decided to make a movie about American politics,’ said a senior Biden adviser, speaking of the German filmmaker known for his disaster films. ‘No one would have predicted that we are potentially looking at a January where six Democratic presidential candidates are potentially serving on a jury in which Donald Trump is the defendant.’”



Trump wanted to fire inspector general for disloyalty - NYT: “President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower’s complaint about Mr. Trump’s interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower’s complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said. The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said.”



Trump welcomes Turkish strongman Erdogan - AP: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Donald Trump met Wednesday as relations between the NATO allies are at their lowest point in decades, with Turkey drifting closer to Russia and Ankara facing a Washington backlash over its offensive against Kurds in Syria. Erdogan and Trump have a difficult agenda. They will discuss Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian air defense system despite its membership in NATO and its incursion into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish forces who have fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State group. The issues threaten to jeopardize a potentially lucrative trade deal between the two countries. The leaders’ scheduled afternoon news conference, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, will give Trump a stage to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry.”

TIME OUT: FINDING THE ‘LOST CITY’

NatGeo: “In 1976 a group of Colombian archaeologists and their guides embarked on a grueling mission to save and ancient site from looters. Swinging machetes, they inched their way over the thick, jungled foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta near Colombia’s Caribbean coast. … Their mission was urgent: Authorities had been tipped off that a major archaeological site had been found by huaqueros, archaeological looters. Items from the site had already begun appearing on the antiquities black market. The team needed to bring the site under state control before more damage was done to the country’s heritage. The team was trying to reach an area that is generally known as Teyuna, which they had taken to calling a more informal name: Ciudad Perdida, ‘lost city.’ The Tairona had abandoned many of their settlements in the late 1600s, but their descendants who still live in the Sierra Nevada had never really considered the city lost.”

HILLARY OPEN TO 2020 RUN: ‘I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME’

USA Today: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, ‘I never say never to anything.’ The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was ‘100%’ certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks ‘all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world.’ ‘So of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time,’ she said. … ‘I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,’ she said. ‘But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.’”



Buttigieg’s New Hampshire plan counts on indies - Politico: “As Pete Buttigieg boarded his campaign bus … a New Hampshire voter stopped him to ask if campaign staffers were hawking ‘Republicans for Pete’ stickers yet. They aren’t. But Buttigieg, who’s staking out center-left ground in the Democratic presidential primary, is trying to build a coalition of unaffiliated voters to go along with Democrats and make a surprise splash in the open-primary state featuring two senators-next-door, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, campaigning on the left. At town halls during his latest swing across New Hampshire, Buttigieg name-checked ‘future former Republicans’ in the same breath as ‘progressives and moderates ... ready for some kind of change.’ His organizers are targeting independent voters from the new field offices Buttigieg opened this fall. And while Buttigieg is polling well in both Iowa and New Hampshire right now … the presence of non-Democrats in the New Hampshire Democratic primary — unlike Iowa’s closed caucus system — could prove decisive in a tight Democratic nominating race...”



But South Carolina looms - National Review: “…a big question hanging over Buttigieg’s head is whether he can make sufficient inroads with African-American primary voters to capture the nomination. Black voters make up about a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate, but two thirds of South Carolina primary voters are black, and Buttigieg remains stuck in the single digits in the Palmetto State. … Buttigieg’s weakness in South Carolina is partly a function of the fact that Joe Biden, former vice president to America’s first black president, retains a commanding lead among black voters. But Buttigieg’s weakness is also partly a function of his sexual orientation, as David Catanese reported in The State last month: ‘Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a possible reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: some see his sexuality as a problem.’”



Sanders tries to sway Hispanic lawmakers - Politico: “Bernie Sanders met privately with Hispanic lawmakers on Tuesday. Sanders, who has aggressively courted Latino voters in his 2020 bid for the White House, is the third presidential candidate to sit down with Latino members under the auspices of BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have also talked with BOLD PAC. Sanders spoke about immigration, Medicare for All, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other issues, including his family’s immigrant roots. A Latino caucus member in the room said several undecided lawmakers were present, and that Sanders did not exclusively talk about economic issues.”



Patrick could complicate Warren’s campaign - Politico: “When Elizabeth Warren was asked to name three African Americans she'd choose for her presidential cabinet last week, she pointed to her friend Deval Patrick as one of them. But the former Massachusetts governor had other ideas. Around the same time, the former governor and a handful of close allies were huddling not far from Warren's campaign headquarters, plotting a surprise entry into the Democratic primary. The now-public prospect of his candidacy — and its potential effect on Warren, who has recently emerged as a Democratic frontrunner — is suddenly the subject of intense speculation among the Massachusetts political class. … His potential entry into the Democratic primary undoubtedly puts a strain on their relationship. Several Massachusetts Democrats — who declined to go on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue — viewed reports that Patrick was preparing to join the field as an affront to Warren, who has been running hard for nearly a year.”



Is there a path for Bloomberg or Patrick? - NYT: “Both men have concluded in recent weeks that Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is not the imposing adversary they had expected him to be, interviews with aides and allies show. Both also believe there is room in the race for a more dynamic candidate who is closer to the political middle than Mr. Biden’s two most prominent challengers, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. Should Mr. [Michael] Bloomberg and Mr. Patrick enter the race, they would test that proposition in different ways: Mr. Bloomberg with a powerfully funded campaign that would take on President Trump directly and contest the biggest states on the primary map from the start; Mr. Patrick with an insurgent candidacy that would begin in next-door New Hampshire and run through South Carolina, where black voters are likely to decide the primary.”

AUDIBLE: THESE GO TO 11

“For those who continually ask, you should just expect that we will continue to make news every day. So don’t ask ‘what’s on tap?’ Just know something’s on tap.” – A House Democratic aide working on the impeachment inquiry said during a conference call with Hill reporters, per Time magazine.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Normally, I hate doing housework, but these days I would rather vacuum than listen to the news. Fortunately, I have the Halftime Report to bring some sanity and understanding to the process. I have a question that I can't seem to find an answer to, and with your vast experience, I was hoping that you know the answer. There is so much argument over who the Democrats will let the Republicans call as witnesses. When it goes to trial in the Senate won't they be able to call whoever they want to testify and uncover anything the Democrats are trying to hide? By the way, I would gladly trade you some good KC BBQ for a few of those pepperoni rolls you are so fond of.” – Tom Steele, Bates City, Mo.



[Ed. note: You are on, Mr. Steele! And yes, you’re quite right about the witness-list histrionics. This is, as they would say in Gregsville, some stuff people say. (Though they don’t really say “stuff.”) Republicans want to reinforce their preferred narrative: This is a kangaroo court and Democrats are denying the president due process. Everything at hand will be pressed into service of that goal.]



“Could Joe Biden's lead in national polling, but not in individual states, be explained by how well he piles up voters in a few very large states e. g. New York, Illinois, and California?” – Tom Snyder, Frankfort, Ill.



[Ed. note: There might be some truth in that, Mr. Snyder. But a couple of things to remember: Good pollsters look for representative geographical distributions. That should be somewhat of a control on that phenomenon. But the larger consideration is that we don’t have any evidence that Biden runs better in these places. We have basically no useful polling in Illinois, but the polling we have from California and New York shows Biden running neck and neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. National polling tells me that Biden’s base isn’t geographic as much as it is demographic. He does best with non-white voters, especially women. If a Democratic candidate had to choose any bloc on which to base his or her candidacy, that would be the one to pick.]



“So the Democrats have moved their December debate to Loyola Marymount. What are they thinking? It's a fine school but Roman Catholic. You know, the institution with no women priests, the one steadfastly opposed to abortion, gay marriage, etc.” – Stuart Barr, Durham, N.C.



[Ed. note: But Will Joe Biden take communion while he’s there?]



“Chris, It occurs to me that polls and surveys (now a routine part of everybody's lives) supports and reinforces the identity politics of the far left. There was a time (in my distant past) when surveys, etc. only identified people by partisan segment (Democrat, Republican, Independent) and location. Beyond that, we were all ‘Americans.’ Now we go much deeper into who people are by describing their demographic associations. While the factions that the founding fathers warned against undoubtedly benefit, they do so by knowing which demographic groups to target and shape their messages accordingly. … I was raised believing that voting was my opportunity to express my view regarding who would be best for the WHOLE country. I NEVER hear that point of view anymore either in the family, in the classroom, in the media. I rarely hear it in political ads. Your thoughts?” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I don’t know how much of this phenomenon you can lay at the feet of public pollsters. The revolution in public opinion research began more than 40 years ago as marketing gurus demanded better ways to sell floor wax, Ford Granadas and Funyuns. People with carpets don’t need floor wax, people who only drive Chevys don’t care about Granadas and Funyuns, while not broadly popular, have a hugely devoted core of enthusiasts. So companies decided it would be worth spending money to find out how to target the hardwood-floor-having-Ford-loving-Funyun-scarfing population rather than just wasting money on broad-spectrum ads. Back then it was about finding the right magazines and television shows in which to advertise. In time, the same kind of market research being used in corporate America made it over to the far-less-lucrative world of politics. Politics had always been about message targeting based on the demographics of various precincts. Since the birth of the republic, politicians targeted their messages to the constituents of various precincts. Gerrymandering, after all, has been with us from the start. But thanks to marketing magic, by the turn of the 21st century, campaigns were able to engage in “micro-targeting,” in which they could zero in on specific demographic subsets in geographic areas. Are you a gun-rights zealot but live in an overwhelmingly Democratic neighborhood? Are you usually an indifferent Republican-leaner, but are ardently pro-choice? Campaigns became increasingly able to zero in on you with ads, calls and mail. The trend exploded with the birth of online advertising. That all would be happening however public pollsters conducted their work. By the way, the reason polls have to pay attention to demographics – gender, ethnicity, income, education, etc. – is so that we end up with samples that are actually representative of the country. If you knew that there were 100 purple marbles, 50 green marbles and 25 orange marbles in a pouch and pulled five oranges in a row you might start to wonder about your sampling methods.]



“With the potential for a 3-way tie at the top of the Democrat pack, do you think Michael Bloomberg is counting on being the compromise candidate at a brokered convention? By at least getting his name in, he is signaling his availability when they realize ‘none of the above’ can win.” – Sheila Willis, Toronto, Canada



[Ed. note: I think there’s quite a bit to that, Ms. Willis. And hey, why not? The median net worth for an American household is, according to the Federal Reserve, just shy of $100,000. Bloomberg is worth something like $50 billion. If he spent, let’s say, $50 million on a just-in-case candidacy that would be .1 percent of his fortune – the equivalent of $100 for the average family.]



“Yes, Branagh’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is worth a look. But so is the night-before-battle scene where Henry wanders through the camp in disguise to gauge the spirit of the troops. Branagh does not hold back on the moral ambivalence of the original Shakespeare. In contrast, Sir Laurence Olivier, commissioned by Churchill in wartime, had to tone the camp scene down in his 1944 version. And Olivier’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is also stirring for this Veteran’s Day, but in a different style.” – John McNeill Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: Good notes all, Mr. Lee!]



“Chris, I didn't know where to send this now that you’re off twitter. Since I get the Halftime Report I figured this is as good a place as any. … I'm a Midwestern boy and in trying to find my father a solid gift for Christmas last year I needed a new plan. … My first place to start was with bacon. My father (as with most Midwestern men) loves bacon. So I set out with my Google Fu to find the best there is to offer. Seemed that most signs pointed to one man and his amazing Tennessee smoked bacon and hams. Bentons County Hickory Smoked Bacon is said to be some amazing stuff. … I in no way work for Bentons or have any affiliation with them, I’m just a fan of wonderful bacon. I ordered him a box and he was so blown away I had to get myself one after the holidays to test the hype. It's some awesome stuff. … So if you have not heard of this amazing goodness I thought I would throw it on your radar… I hope you and your family have a wonderful set of holidays.” – Matt Ladd, Arlington, Va.



[Ed. note: I have many times enjoyed Benton’s delicious bacon and hams, Mr. Ladd. I, myself, prefer Edwards of Virginia, but then again, my tastes run more toward country ham over bacon for luxury cured meats. Benton’s ham is marvelous, too. But you may want to check out a bone-in Wigwam ham from Edwards this year. Pure ambrosia. And unlike the bacon, when you’re done, you can make bean soup!]

WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS…

The Island Packet: “Parrish Brown thought it was strange when the Hilton Head Island [S.C.] McDonald’s worker paused as he ordered a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon. ‘Extra lemon?’ the drive-thru worker asked in an odd voice. Brown later figured out what the ‘extra lemon’ was about when he discovered quite a bit of weed inside his sweet tea — after he drank it, at work. The 24-year-old Charleston man called the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office … to report the incident. ‘I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” Brown said. … Finally … he opened up the lid only to find something he wasn’t expecting: three bags of marijuana. … ‘I kept being like ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’’ he said. ‘The officer asked me why I drank it and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“…History has been unkind to every stripe of utopian thinking. But it is not just that we have failed to achieve the messianic future. Even the democratic present is under widespread assault.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in a 2017 essay “The Authoritarian Temptation,” published in his posthumous book, “The Point of It All.”

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., kicked off the first public hearing of the Trump impeachment inquiry Wednesday by dismissing the allegations as a ""carefully orchestrated smear campaign"" and a ""low-rent"" follow-up to the Russia investigation, which failed to produce evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow.

Nunes addressed Wednesday's witnesses, Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and State Department official George Kent, stating that they are being used in a ""televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats,"" after accusing Democrats of selecting witnesses ""deemed suitable for television"" and auditioning them during the closed-door sessions at the beginning of the inquiry.

""It seems you agreed witting or unwittingly to participate in a drama, but the main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended and you’ve been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel,"" Nunes said during his opening statement.

The Republican leader expressed cynicism toward the allegations that President Trump pressured Ukraine into investigating Democratic activities during the 2016 election, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

""We're supposed to take these people at face value when they trot out with a new batch of allegations,"" he said, ""but anyone familiar with the Democrats' scorched-earth war against President Trump would not be surprised to see all the typical signs that this is a carefully orchestrated media smear campaign.""

Nunes said that while Democrats have accused Trump of improper activity involving Russia and Ukraine, the Democrats themselves are the ones who are guilty.

""For years they accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia when they themselves were colluding with Russia by funding and spreading the Steele dossier, which relied on Russian sources,"" he said. ""And now they accuse President Trump of malfeasance in Ukraine when they themselves are culpable.""

Nunes concluded by maintaining the president's innocence and insisting the ongoing inquiry is ""nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime.""

Nunes' statement followed one from Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.. Schiff outlined the parameters of the impeachment inquiry, questioning whether the president sought to condition official acts and ""exploit"" Ukraine's ""vulnerability"" for personal political gain.

""The matter is as simple and as terrible as that,"" Schiff said in his opening statement Wednesday. ""Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief.""

Schiff described the core of the impeachment inquiry, and said: ""If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?”

-- Richard M. Nixon (1913-1994)

As public hearings on impeachment begin, we will see the case for and the case against impeaching President Trump. The facts are largely undisputed, but each side has its version of them.

Democrats will argue that in his July 25, 2019 telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, seen in the context of months of negotiations between American and Ukrainian diplomats, Trump made it known that if the Ukrainian government wanted the $391 million in military and financial aid that Congress authorized and ordered, it first must offer, or announce that it was seeking, dirt on his likely 2020 political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter. That implicates a presidential violation of two federal statutes: One is the prohibition of solicitation of campaign help from a foreign government, and the other is the prohibition of bribery.

Federal election laws prohibit as criminal the mere solicitation of foreign help for a federal political campaign, whether the aid arrives or not. Federal law also prohibits and defines as bribery the intentional withholding or offering to withhold the performance of an official duty until a thing of value arrives, whether the thing of value arrives or not. Solicitation of foreign campaign assistance and bribery are the rare federal crimes that are defined by an attempt or an offer to commit them, even if they are never consummated.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HEARINGS — WHAT REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS CAN EXPECT

All this is magnified, the Democrats will argue, by the immediacy of Ukraine’s financial and military needs. Since 2014, Ukraine has been fighting a bloody war with Russia, resulting in the deaths of 13,000 Ukrainians. In that year, Russia invaded the Ukrainian province of Crimea, which Russia continues to occupy. Since the end of World War II, the stated American policy toward Russia has been to resist and to help allies resist its territorial expansion.

The Democrats will also argue that Trump's orders to executive branch employees to dishonor congressional subpoenas constitute the crime of obstruction of Congress. This is what New York Yankees pitching great Roger Clemens was tried for when he was acquitted of lying to Congress about the contents of his urine. All of these crimes -- solicitation, bribery and obstruction -- are subsumed under the constitutional rubric of high crimes and misdemeanors or bribery. These constitute two of the three permissible bases for impeachment.

None of these crimes requires pressure, coercion or success. Congress considers them so odious to our system that merely offering to commit them constitutes guilt. Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton both were charged with obstruction of Congress by ordering subordinates to refuse to cooperate with congressional investigators -- even though many of them did cooperate.

Republicans will argue that under the Constitution, the president -- not Congress -- sets the foreign policy of the nation. In foreign relations, the Supreme Court has ruled, Congress is limited to declaring war, appropriating funds, ratifying treaties and confirming ambassadors. All else foreign is presidential. Thus, whatever Trump wanted of the Ukrainian government, unless there is proof of evil intent, he was free to ask for. They will argue that there is no evidence of evil intent such as self-dealing or harming an ally or frustrating a congressional purpose.

Republicans will also argue that the impeachment process is irretrievably compromised by the personal involvement, partisan advocacy and secretive methods of the chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. From this, they will argue that Schiff, and the evidence he developed, should be excluded from the proceedings. As well, to House Republicans, the crimes of illegal solicitation, bribery and obstruction of Congress require proof of Trump's guilty state of mind, and such proofs are lacking.

Stated differently, Republicans will contend that because the president was ignorant of federal law and ignorant of his constitutional obligations to spend money as and when Congress directed, he cannot be punished for what he did not know.

This is dangerously close to the Nixonian view of the American presidency -- that the president can do no wrong. Of course, Republicans will not state this plainly, as the lessons of Watergate and Nixon's resignation have soundly and universally repudiated that view.

Finally, Republicans will argue that impeachment cheats democracy. Here they are correct. However, that is not an argument against impeachment. It is an argument against history. James Madison -- the scrivener of the Constitution -- intentionally included anti-democratic features in the Constitution to preserve personal liberty from the tyranny of a congressional majority and the tyranny of presidential ignorance.

The whole purpose of an independent judiciary, for example, is to be anti-democratic -- to preserve the life, liberty and property of the minority from the tyranny of popular laws. And the whole purpose of impeachment is to correct an election after the elected person has demonstrated that he is unfit for office.

The House is operating under rules adopted in 2015, when Republicans ran the House. Schiff is no more secretive about or partisan against the president than my old boss, then-Judiciary chair Rep. Peter Rodino, was toward Nixon or then-Judiciary chair Rep. Henry Hyde was toward Clinton. Both acquired evidence from secret proceedings, and both decided to impeach before any public hearings were held.

Impeachment is political, not juridical. Former President Gerald R. Ford was essentially right when he argued that under the Constitution impeachable offenses are whatever a majority of the House says they are -- for Nixon, covering up a break-in; for Clinton, lying about consensual sex; for Trump, solicitation, bribery and obstruction.

Whose behavior was arguably the gravest?

Desperate Democrats know they have no chance of removing President Trump in a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. But they are determined to use their House majority to impeach him and send their ridiculous case against him to the Senate for a pointless trial for one reason only: to hurt his reelection chances.

This is what the whole disgraceful publicity stunt Democrats are calling an impeachment inquiry is all about – pure politics and nothing else.

DAY ONE OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS PUTS PRESSURE ON MODERATE DEMS

Absurdly, these hearings were sparked by a routine phone call between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

A so-called whistleblower hiding behind a cloak of anonymity started this whole costly and time-wasting nonsensical impeachment process. It will ultimately collapse – but not until Democrats have days of free TV time to level their baseless charges against the duly elected president of the United States.

Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified before the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday in the opening act of this televised impeachment farce.

Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chose to kick-off his exercise in Trump-bashing with the public testimony of Taylor and Kent – despite the fact they were not even on July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call and therefore have no firsthand knowledge of what was discussed.

This is what the whole disgraceful publicity stunt Democrats are calling an impeachment inquiry is all about – pure politics and nothing else

In fact, Schiff’s star witness – Ambassador Taylor – testified that in three meetings with President Zelensky, the issue of “linkage” never came up. This involved a supposed quid pro quo under which Ukraine would only be able to get U.S. foreign aid if it investigated the role of the nation’s previous government in helping Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, along with what appear to be blatantly corrupt activities by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.

The truth is that everything Taylor claims he knows about the facts of the case is based on hearsay. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, was right when he stated at the hearing Wednesday that hearsay very often turns out to be untrue.

Furthermore, Kent testified in his deposition that he’d “never in 27 years been on a call made by a president of the United States” and he had “no knowledge of the specifics of the call record” between Presidents Trump and Zelensky.

One person who was on the call – President Zelensky – has stated repeatedly that there was no pressure from President Trump and nothing inappropriate was discussed on the call.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, deftly questioned Ambassador Taylor about his so-called “clear understanding” of linkage between investigations and U.S. foreign aid.

Jordan rebuffed Taylor’s hearsay-inspired testimony by showing him a sworn declaration from another impeachment witness – U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland – that was about as clear as mud.

The Sondland declaration stated in part that “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I had conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky.”

Jordan described the perplexing statement in epic fashion: “We got six people taking about four conversations in one sentence and you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding?”

This exchange led by the highly effective Jordan was the highlight of Wednesday’s questioning. The fact that Democrats are relying on indecipherable testimony such as this is exactly why their case is collapsing.

Democratic impeachment addicts in the House have a fundamental problem that is insurmountable. There was no quid pro quo with Ukraine; there was no abuse of power and there was no “extortion scheme” because Ukraine received the U.S. foreign aid without initiating any investigation.

The big takeaway from the opening impeachment hearing is that Schiff – the ringleader of the Democrat coup attempt against President Trump – has a Clinton problem. He’s a liar who suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Schiff will never build public support for his pathetic impeachment theory with the American people because he has no credibility and no evidence.

First off, at the Wednesday hearing Schiff obviously lied when he said he doesn’t know the identity of the whistleblower. It strains credulity that Schiff’s staff didn’t tell him the identity of the whistleblower once they were in contact with him.

Not to mention, some news organizations and social media have identified a person they claim to be the whistleblower for weeks. The idea that Schiff is oblivious to all of this is not possible.

Secondly, Schiff lied about President Trump’s call with Zelensky during an earlier congressional proceeding. The Democratic congressman falsified the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call at a public hearing for political purposes. Schiff doctored what was said on the call because the call itself was routine and undramatic.

Next, Schiff lied about his staff’s contact with the anonymous whistleblower. Why did he lie? Because Schiff doesn’t want the whistleblower’s complaint to appear concocted or politically inspired.

As it turns out, Schiff’s staff was in contact with the whistleblower in the lead-up to the complaint being filed because this entire circus is an orchestrated conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2016 election and nullify the votes of 63 million Americans who cast ballots for Donald Trump.

Schiff’s staff is made up of partisan Democrats and the whistleblower is also reportedly a partisan Democrat.

After that, Schiff lied about allowing the whistleblower to testify. At some point Schiff came to the conclusion that the whistleblower’s alleged political bias is too big a risk and his testimony to the committee would destroy the already flimsy case the Democrats have put together.

In light of this suspicious change in direction, shouldn’t Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson answer questions about why he disregarded the whistleblower’s reported political bias and pushed ahead with sending the complaint to Congress as a matter of urgent concern?

The American people have a right to know why Schiff no longer thinks the whistleblower’s testimony is important, even though Atkinson believed the information he possessed was of urgent concern.

Schiff also lied about conducting the impeachment inquiry in a fair and impartial manner. If Schiff was interested in fairness in his crazed pursuit to impeach President Trump for trying to root out Biden-related corruption in Ukraine, why won’t he allow Republicans to call the former vice president and his son to testify about what they were doing in Ukraine?

If Schiff was interested in the truth, obtaining these facts would be an essential part of the record. Schiff’s refusal to allow this testimony smacks of politics and further damages his credibility and greatly damages his case.

As the leader of the coup attempt against President Trump, Schiff is incapable of telling the truth and has no credibility. Every American should keep that in mind when this witch hunt reconvenes on Friday with Schiff again running the show.

""It’s a sad day,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, told Fox News on Tuesday. ""A calm day. A prayerful day."" For his part, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called the hearings a ""solemn undertaking"" in a letter to colleagues.

Behind the scenes, House Democrats were predicting a ""phenomenal week,"" Fox News is told. At the same time, Republicans have been preparing a methodical and vigorous cross-examination of Democrats' witnesses, whose accounts of President Trump's alleged wrongdoing have been based largely on hearsay and intuition.

Capitol Hill security officials told Fox News they're not anticipating the kinds of organized protests that rocked the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh last year, but sources on both sides of the aisle have cautioned that the day will be unpredictable. The proceedings are to be held in the cavernous House Ways and Means Committee hearing room at the Longworth House Office Building.

PRIVATE MILITARY SELLERS PRESSURED PENTAGON TO RESUME UKRAINE AID, DEFENSE DEPT OFFICIAL TESTIFIES

With the bang of a gavel, Schiff will open the impeachment hearings Wednesday into Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden's dealings in the country. The former vice president, a Democrat, has boasted about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, as his son Hunter Biden held a lucrative role board of a Ukrainian natural gas company despite having little relevant expertise.

A whistleblower's complaint about Trump's July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ignited the impeachment investigation. During the hearing Wednesday, a key exchange during that 30-minute call, which has been outlined in a Sept. 24 transcript released by the White House, could take center stage. Zelensky has said he felt no pressure during the call.

""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" Trump said at one point in the call, after a mention of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Ukraine apparently was not aware that the U.S. was withholding new military aid until August, approximately two weeks before the U.S. ultimately released the aid and well after Trump's phone call with Zelensky.

EMAILS OBTAINED BY FOX NEWS SHOW KEY DEM IMPEACHMENT WITNESS WASN'T HONEST UNDER OATH, GOP SEN SAYS

On the call, Trump then asked Zelensky to investigate reports that Ukraine had some involvement in 2016 election interference (Politico has reported that Ukraine worked behind the scenes to boost Hillary Clinton.) Later on in the conversation, amid a discussion of deep-seated Ukrainian corruption, Trump mentioned Biden's push to have Ukraine's prosecutor fired, and suggested the country look into the matter.

Republicans have pointed out that the U.S. also delayed military aid assistance for Lebanon and Armenia. The GOP is expected to say the European Union was not doing its fair share to help root out corruption in Ukraine.

“The Russia invasion of Crimea had more to do with Europe than with the U.S.,” one Republican source told Fox News.

Trump has said the call was ""perfect"" and contained no ""quid pro quo,"" or this for that. Democrats, meanwhile, have said it showed Trump using his office to pressure a foreign government to help him politically.

Big questions loomed, including how strongly administration officials connected Trump's apparent desire for a probe to the question of whether to provide military aid to Ukraine -- and whether such a probe would have been inappropriate. At its heart, the GOP argument was that the impeachment effort was unfair and sparked because ""unelected and anonymous bureaucrats disagreed"" with Trump's decisions on Ukraine.

Shortly after Schiff's gavel, he and ranking Republican Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are to begin the questioning. They get 45 minutes each, or can designate staff attorneys to do so.

ICIG COMPLAINT ALLEGES UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER MAY HAVE ILLEGALLY SOLICITED FUNDS FROM 'PROHIBITED SOURCES'

Members of the panel will then get five minutes each to ask questions, alternating between Republicans and Democrats.

For the Democrats, expect to hear from Daniel Goldman and Daniel Noble, both counsels for the Intelligence Committee. Fox News is told on the GOP side, Steve Castor, whom Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan brought over from the Oversight Committee, will be the counsel to pose questions for the minority.

Republicans recently placed Jordan on the Intelligence Committee. Though Nunes is the senior Republican, the congressman from Ohio could act as an especially fierce attacker of the witnesses' credibility and the Democrats' case for impeachment.

Goldman and Castor asked the bulk of the questions of witnesses during weeks of closed-door depositions with current and former administration officials and diplomats.

""You're going to see a prosecutorial approach,"" said Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Goldman to successfully prosecute a Genovese family boss and two mob hit men for racketeering, two murders and an attempted murder. ""You will see somebody who knows every detail of every piece of evidence and will bring it to bear in his questioning. You'll see someone who knows how to get right to the point.""

Goldman is a left-wing partisan who has promoted the largely discredited Steele dossier that kickstarted the Russia collusion narrative. A nearly two-year investigation by the special counsel's office failed to substantiate numerous key claims in the dossier, including that Russians possessed a lewd tape of the president, that Michael Cohen traveled to Prague as part of a conspiracy, or that the president's campaign was employing hackers in the U.S. to subvert the election.

Democrats chose Ambassador Bill Taylor and career Foreign Service officer George Kent to kick off the public hearings. ""They both were witness to the full storyline of the president’s misconduct,"" a Democratic aide told Fox News.

The two likely will describe a parallel foreign policy toward Ukraine led by Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and other White House officials.

""I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing and ultimately alarming circumstances,"" Taylor testified in an Oct. 22 statement. Taylor, a West Point graduate and Vietnam War veteran who has served under every presidential administration, Republican and Democrat, since 1985, also worked for then-Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.

Taylor said it was ""crazy"" that the Trump administration may have been withholding U.S. military assistance to the Eastern European ally over the political investigations, with Russian forces on Ukraine's border on watch for a moment of weakness.

Fox News is told the Democrats' game plan has been to let the witnesses ""tell their story"" on Wednesday. ""We need to facilitate and stay out of the way,"" one Democrat involved in the questioning said.

Democrats also told Fox News that Taylor had ""the best view of the scheme. He is a habitual note-taker. He is your worst nightmare. Very prepared.""

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL FLAGGED HUNTER BIDEN'S 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST' IN UKRAINE, TESTIMONY SHOWS

One source told Fox News the most important line in all of the previously released transcripts so far may have come from Taylor: ""Irregular policy channels were running contrary to longstanding goals of U.S. policy,"" Taylor said in his testimony.

But, Republicans have countered that it's the role of the president -- not unelected career bureaucrats -- to set U.S. foreign policy.

And, Taylor wasn’t on the phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Fox News is told Republicans will cross-examine Taylor repeatedly over his lack of ""first-hand knowledge"" about the call.

""Hearsay puts a lot of people in jail,"" one Democratic source told Fox News. ""Eyewitness testimony can be tough. Cops will tell you that. Taylor's deducing all of this.""

Republicans, meanwhile, are expected to ask Taylor how and why he thought there was a ""linkage"" and ""who told you that.""

Kent, a career foreign service officer, testified on Oct. 15 there were three words Trump wanted to hear from the Ukraine president: ""Investigations, Biden and Clinton.""

He also told the investigators about the ""campaign"" of smears against former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch that he said Giuliani waged, leading to her being recalled from the position.

Yovanovitch is set to testify Friday. She previously testified on Oct. 11 that she was told people were ""looking to hurt"" her.

Fox News reported last week that Yovanovitch, a key witness for Democrats, communicated via her personal email account with a Democratic congressional staffer concerning a ""quite delicate"" and ""time-sensitive"" matter -- just two days after the whistleblower complaint that kickstarted the inquiry was filed, and a month before the complaint became public.

Emails obtained by Fox News appeared to contradict Yovanovitch's deposition on Capitol Hill last month, in which she told U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., about an email she received Aug. 14 from the staffer, Laura Carey -- but suggested under oath that she never responded to it.

'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY ANNOUNCES IN 2017

Zeldin told Fox News: ""I specifically asked her whether the Democratic staffer was responded to by Yovanovitch or the State Department. It is greatly concerning that Ambassador Yovanovitch didn't answer my question as honestly as she should have, especially while under oath.""

Republicans have privately acknowledged to Fox News that they might have a problem. ""How do you counteract Kent and Taylor when you don’t have a witness to counter them?"" one Republican source asked.

Schiff has approved just three of nine witnesses sought by the GOP. They were envoy Kurt Volker, State Department official David Hale and National Security Council aide Timothy Morrison.

Last week, Schiff rejected a request by Republicans to have the Ukraine phone call whistleblower testify, saying that their testimony was ""redundant and unnecessary."" The GOP witness list, obtained by Fox News this past Saturday, also included Hunter Biden.

Late Tuesday, Schiff announced that open hearings will again be held next week from Nov. 19-21. In addition to Volker, Hale and Morrison, the new witness list included Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Pence; Alexander Vindman, the director for European affairs at the National Security Council; U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian Affairs Laura Cooper; and former National Security Council official Fiona Hill.

BOLTON WARNED THAT UKRAINE CALL WOULD BE A 'DISASTER,' BILL TAYLOR TESTIFIES IN CLOSED-DOOR HEARING

White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, for his part, said Tuesday he no longer plans to sue over the impeachment proceedings and will instead follow Trump's directions and decline to cooperate.

Aside from witnesses, there will also be exhibits -- lots and lots of exhibits. Democrats, at least, are expected to display excerpts from transcripts, text messages, relevant news articles and social media posts.

The Democrats reportedly have been wary of Republicans trying ""stunts"" and being argumentative in an effort to distract from the case against the president.

""By Act II, I suspect the Dancing Bears will enter the room,"" one Democratic source said. But, GOP sources downplayed the idea of guerilla tactics during the hearing.

Schiff, in a memo and open letter to colleagues on the eve of Wednesday's proceedings, outlined some of the rules -- including that members not assigned to the Intelligence Committee were not permitted to make statements or question witnesses, but were allowed to sit in the audience.

""It is important to underscore that the House’s impeachment inquiry, and the committee, will not serve as venues for any member to further the same sham investigations into the Bidens or into debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake for his personal political benefit,"" Schiff wrote.

The goal is to end the hearing by 4:30 p.m.

It's only the fourth time in American history that Congress has launched impeachment proceedings against a sitting president. Two of those — against Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton 130 years later— resulted in their impeachments, or formal charges approved by the House.

Both were acquitted by the Senate, which requires a two-thirds vote to remove a sitting president under the Constitution. The House impeaches by a majority vote.

Former President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before the House could vote to impeach him.

During Watergate, the Senate held televised hearings that served to turn public opinion against Nixon. The most sensational moments -- including the testimony of White House counsel John Dean and Sen. Howard Baker's famous question, ""What did the president know and when did he know it?"" -- occurred not during House impeachment hearings but during special Watergate hearings in the Senate.

Pelosi initially was reluctant to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. As Democrats took control of the House in January, she said impeachment would be ""too divisive"" for the country. Trump, she said, was simply ""not worth it.""

After former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s widely panned appearance on Capitol Hill in July for the end of the Russia probe, the door to impeachment proceedings seemed closed.

But, the next day, Trump got on the phone with Ukraine's leader.

We are entering an incredibly divisive moment in American history. Democrats will continue to move the factual “goalposts” and deny the president fundamental due process and fairness – bedrock constitutional principles at the foundation of our country.

Democrats in the House will cherry-pick the witnesses and thereby paint an inaccurate picture of what the president is alleged to have done.

ADAM SCHIFF, DEMOCRATS 'HAVE NOTHING ON THE PRESIDENT, TOP REPUBLICAN SAYS

There has been no witness – other than the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – that has offered a firsthand account of what President Trump did regarding Ukraine military aid and a possible investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s corruption.

The real question after this week is which side’s narrative will be stronger.

The Democrats’ allegation that the president attempted extortion or bribery (very high bar, requiring direct evidence)? Or the Republicans’ belief that the president was required through our mutual legal assistance treaty with Ukraine to request that the country look into potential corruption by Biden and his son Hunter, who was highly paid to serve on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company?

But the broader question that the American people should ask is: Is it the highest and best use of the time of the House of Representatives to spend weeks looking for any actual evidence of the president violating the law? And should the Senate be tied up for a month or so conducting a trial if the president is impeached less than one year before our next presidential election?

Should Congress instead pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade? Should our elected lawmakers take action to reduce suicides among military veterans? Should Congress help our farmers compete on the world stage and assist small businesses and entrepreneurs with a regulatory and tax burden that is quite frankly too high?

Where are statesmen and stateswomen in Congress? Why aren’t Democratic leaders speaking out against this partisan impeachment charade, knowing the permanent damage it is going to inflict on our country?

I know that America’s founders would never have imagined the situation that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, both California Democrats, have created by choosing this path to undo an election of a duly elected president of the United States.

Someone once told me early in my career that politics is a sport played with blunt instruments. We should fully expect that – if this impeachment effort has any success in hurting President Trump’s reelection in 2020 – an impeachment inquiry will be the blunt instrument of future elections.

We will not be better off as a republic if the president is impeached on a purely partisan vote in the House.

Many Democrats in the House do not come from competitive districts, and quite frankly aren’t concerned about what this impeachment will inflict on the entire country. They appear to only want to protect their left flanks from potential primary challenges.

Impeaching President Trump on completely partisan grounds is bad for our country and has a long-term consequence of being a new blunt instrument that cannot be returned to the sidelines.

Like lemmings following their leaders into the sea, rank and file Democrats in the House are following their leaders into a partisan hole that will only strengthen President Trump and his 2020 reelection. God save the Republic.

How ironic it would be if the Democratic bloodlust to destroy President Trump winds up giving him four more years as president.

In back-to-back press conferences, Pelosi and McCarthy delivered starkly contrasting accounts of the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, with both claiming their respective parties were fighting to protect the U.S. Constitution.

GOP REPS TO ZERO IN ON UKRAINE MEDDLING CLAIMS, AFTER DIPLOMATS STUMPED AT HEARING

“Democrats are showing great patriotism,” Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday, praising Schiff, D-Calif., for his “dignity and statesmanship.” “This isn’t about politics or anything political, it’s about patriotism, it’s about honoring our oath of office, and upholding the Constitution.”

She added: “This is something we do with a heavy heart. This is very prayerful, because impeachment is a divisive thing in our country.”

Pelosi went on to accuse the president of “bribery,” citing Wednesday’s public hearing featuring what she called “devastating” witness testimony from State Department official George Kent and U.S. top diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.

“Bribery—and that is in the Constitution and attached to impeachment proceedings,” Pelosi said. “The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the election—that’s bribery.”

When asked whether bribery would be included as an article of impeachment, Pelosi replied: “We haven’t even made a decision to impeach. That’s what the inquiry is about.”

“I’m saying, [what] the president has admitted to as ‘perfect,’ is bribery,” Pelosi said.

Minutes later, McCarthy, R-Calif., took the podium on the other side of the House, claiming it’s Republicans who are “standing up” for the Constitution.

“Are they doing this for political purposes or are they standing for the Constitution?” McCarthy said. “They came to Congress to impeach the president.”

McCarthy went on to blast Schiff, claiming he “has continued to lie to the American public.”

McCarthy outlined several instances where he believed Schiff had lied—including during the congressional Russia probe and when he “on purpose” delivered a parody reading last month of the transcript of Trump’s now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.

That phone call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the Intelligence Community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

On the call, Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into Ukrainian election meddling in the 2016 presidential race and into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

Zelensky, though, has said he felt no pressure during the call. The White House has maintained no wrongdoing, and the president has repeatedly said the call was “perfect,” arguing that it contained “no quid pro quo.”

McCarthy also said that Schiff “lied again” when he claimed during the public hearing on Wednesday that he “didn’t know who the whistleblower was.”

“His staff met with the whistleblower, he can claim he did not. They met with the whistleblower before the whistleblower had an attorney and before the whistleblower went to the inspector general,” McCarthy explained. “When he went, you know that the whistleblower did not say that he met with Schiff’s staff.”

Fox News reported last month that the whistleblower did not disclose contact with Schiff’s staff to the intelligence committee inspector general (ICIG).

Schiff’s office acknowledged that the whistleblower had reached out to them before filing a complaint in mid-August, giving Democrats advance warning of the accusations that would lead them to launch an impeachment inquiry days later.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN RAISES $3.3 MILLION ON FIRST DAY OF IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

During his attack of Schiff, McCarthy said he does “not think that Schiff is fit to be in the position to run the Intelligence Committee.”

“And yes, I do believe Schiff has spent his entire time in Congress, since the president has been in, trying to impeach him,” McCarthy said. “He’s already written the script and he’s trying to fill it in—he’s been auditioning witnesses in the basement.”

Meanwhile, up next on Friday in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry is former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich, with a number of other hearings with current and former top officials scheduled for next week."

Millions of Americans are asking themselves that question as the House Intelligence Committee begins televised impeachment hearings Wednesday. As Democrats and Republicans look at what is publicly known so far, they are coming up with dramatically different answers.

The impeachment question is like a Rorschach test – the psychological test in which people look at inkblots and tell a tester what the inkblots look like. Looking at the same inkblots, different people often see very different things.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: ELECTIONS, NOT IMPEACHMENTS ARE HOW WE RESOLVE POLICY DISPUTES IN THIS COUNTRY

A lot of evidence about what most Democrats consider Trump’s misconduct – and what most Republicans say is either OK or at least not impeachable – has already been published and broadcast. In fact, so much is out there that most people with busy lives don’t have time to keep up with it all.

But in most cases, if you ask a Democrat about the evidence known so far, he or she will say it paints a picture of an arrogant and dishonest president who abuses his power for political and personal gain and thinks he is above the law.

If you ask a Republican, he or she will most likely judge the evidence quite differently – the way two different people see very different pictures in the inkblots of the Rorschach test.

Republicans typically think Trump has done a good job in office and should stay there, leaving it to voters to determine if he should serve another four years beginning in 2021.

The Republicans say Democrats are attacking Trump because they can’t stand his policies and the way he conducts himself and want to weaken him before he runs for reelection next year – not because he’s guilty of serious wrongdoing.

And Republicans often get hung up on the process of the impeachment inquiry now being conducted by the House Intelligence Committee, rather than the substance of the accusations against Trump.

The central accusation is that Trump held up nearly $400 million in vital aid for Ukraine to pressure that nation’s president to launch an investigation of Democratic presidential contender former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.

We need to keep our different views of the Trump Rorschach test in perspective. Sometimes we simply have to agree to disagree with friends and loved ones on political issues and not let them become all-consuming.

In other words, Trump is accused of placing his own interest above our national interest, which requires America to support Ukraine against Russian military forces that have already seized control of Crimea and threaten Eastern Ukraine.

Democratic critics of Trump also accuse him of obstruction of Congress by trying to stop administration officials from testifying in the impeachment inquiry. And they criticize his repeated attacks on the anonymous whistleblower who got the impeachment inquiry started with a complaint about Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

And don’t get me started on all the other things many Democrats accuse Trump of doing – that would take up a book.

I have both Democratic and Republican friends. How do I talk to the warring camps? And how can you without hurting friendships or even marriages when the two people come out on different sides of the impeachment debate?

Americans were already divided over President Trump. The impeachment fight has widened those divides, causing arguments among friends and within families. We can anticipate plenty of heated discussions around Thanksgiving tables around the country later this month.

We need to keep our different views of the Trump Rorschach test in perspective. Sometimes we simply have to agree to disagree with friends and loved ones on political issues and not let them become all-consuming. We shouldn’t let these disagreements destroy our relationships.

When I talk to my friends of all political persuasions about impeachment, I remind them that this will almost certainly not result in kicking Donald Trump out of the White House. Impeachment is an action by a majority vote in the House charging the president with wrongdoing to warrant removal from office.

Actually removing Trump requires 67 votes after a trial in the Senate. But Democrats and allied independents only hold 47 Senate seats. Even if all vote to convict Trump, another 20 Republicans would have to join them to oust Trump from the White House. At this time that looks like it would be virtually impossible.

Polls show Americans are about evenly split on what should happen to Trump. In total, pollsters tell us about 49 percent want Trump impeached and convicted so he can be removed from office, while 46 percent oppose his impeachment and removal.

But the figures are dramatically different when broken down by political party. Some 88 percent of Democrats want Trump removed from office, but 90 percent of Republicans oppose impeachment and removal.

As the evidence mounts against Trump’s misconduct, more and more Republicans are acknowledging that the president’s actions were inappropriate – but argue that they were not impeachable. But Trump insists he did nothing wrong and says his call with the president of Ukraine was “perfect.”

Keep in mind that the House has impeached only two presidents: Andrew Johnson after the Civil War and Bill Clinton. Johnson and Clinton were acquitted in Senate trials. President Richard Nixon resigned when it seemed certain the House was about to impeach him in the Watergate scandal.

In Trump’s case, I think we will see a repeat of what we saw when Clinton and Johnson were impeached. That is, he will be impeached by the House but remain in office after the Senate fails to get 67 votes to convict him.

And keep in mind that Clinton’s approval rating jumped to 74 percent after being impeached and that Republicans then lost seats in in both the House and the Senate. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., resigned.

I don’t think the House pursuing impeachment will lead to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stepping down. And as we recently saw in the Nov. 5 elections, Democrats were not hurt by the impeachment inquiry process, especially in Virginia and Kentucky.

But Pelosi has reluctantly moved to open the impeachment inquiry. She knows it is dividing the country and she knows impeachment will need some Republican support to be seen as something other than a partisan attack on Trump.

I tell my Democratic friends that the only way to ensure that Donald Trump is removed from office and made a one-term president is with the power of their vote. They can’t rely on the impeachment process to do this for them.

Congress with its power to impeach and remove might not be able to help Democrats achieve their goal, but all Americans can certainly help elect a new president – or decide to keep Trump in office – with their votes in November 2020. This is the strength of our democracy, and it is what made American great long before any of us alive today were born."

So in the spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.’ Patrick is expected to travel later on Thursday to neighboring New Hampshire to file for the state’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary.

Biden proposes $1.3 trillion infrastructure plan - Politico: “Joe Biden wants to spend $1.3 trillion on infrastructure as president, aiming to reduce carbon emissions, create jobs and shore up the ailing Highway Trust Fund with ‘new revenues’ in a plan released Thursday that's reminiscent of the Obama years. Biden’s 12-page plan promises to ‘ensure new revenues are secured to stabilize the Highway Trust Fund’ but doesn’t specify where those revenues would come from or how he would get political consensus for them. In many ways it's also a throwback to the administration of President Barack Obama, with planks related to ‘complete streets,’ repairing existing infrastructure before building new and calling for investments in transit and high-speed rail. The plan’s goal of working directly with cities, instead of always going through state departments of transportation as an intermediary, is another throwback.”



Pragmatic Klobuchar gaining ground - Time: “While Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proffered revolutionary proposals—including free college tuition, nationwide student-debt cancellation and Medicare for All—[Amy] Klobuchar has staked out a platform defined by pragmatism. Her higher-education plan centers on free in-state community college and higher Pell Grant caps, and her health care proposal offers a public option through which people could purchase access to Medicare or Medicaid. …Klobuchar has seized the opportunity to brand herself as the moderate alternative—a take-your-vitamins realist in a field defined by idealism. There’s some evidence her strategy is working. In the six days after the October debate … Klobuchar’s campaign raked in $2.1 million… She has since become one of 10 candidates to qualify for the November debate in Atlanta, and one of six to qualify for the December one in Los Angeles. Her support in the Hawkeye State has swelled too.”



Post heart attack Sanders trying to rebound - NYT: “Before a campaign event last month, Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, went for an hourlong stroll around Green Castle Recreation Area, a lush park in central Iowa with evergreen trees and a small lake. … Ms. Sanders is ensuring that her husband is getting adequate rest, and he has been requesting fish for dinner instead of steak or ribs. … Some allies, aware that Mr. Sanders can appear rumpled, have even urged him to dress better — he has been wearing more stylish sweaters — and to rein in his previously unkempt hair. … His recuperative program has coincided with a vigorous push to reboot his campaign… He and his team recognize that his ability to beat his chief ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren, and the rest of the leading candidates depends in part on whether he can convince voters that his age, and his health, is not an issue.”



Warren attacks billionaires in new campaign ad - CNBC: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is launching a new attack on the billionaires who have criticized her proposed taxes and policies with a new ad set to air on CNBC this week, according to a campaign aide. Titled ‘Elizabeth Warren Stands Up to Billionaires,’ the ad takes aim at longtime investor Leon Cooperman, former CEO of TD Ameritrade Joe Ricketts, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. The ad will premiere Thursday on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street,’ which airs at 9 a.m. ET, and Jim Cramer’s ‘Mad Money,’ which airs at 6 p.m. ET, in all New York and Washington, D.C., markets, the aide added. The ad will be part of a digital buy, as well. … The ad opens with Warren telling a campaign rally: ‘It is time for a wealth tax.’ The ad then plays clips of the aforementioned billionaires.”



THE RULEBOOK: THE HOUSE REPRESENTS

“Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 52



TIME OUT: ‘CALL ME ISHMAEL.’

History: “Moby-Dick is now considered a great classic of American literature… Initially, though, the book about Captain Ahab and his quest to catch a giant white whale was a flop. Its author, Herman Melville was born in New York City in 1819. … Melville’s sixth book, Moby-Dick, was first published in October 1851 in London, in three volumes titled The Whale, and then in the U.S. a month later [on Nov. 14, 1851]. Melville had promised his publisher an adventure story similar to his popular earlier works, but instead, Moby-Dick was a tragic epic, influenced in part by Melville’s friend and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, neighbor, Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose novels include The Scarlet Letter. … Melville died in 1891, largely forgotten by the literary world. By the 1920s, scholars had rediscovered his work, particularly Moby-Dick, which would eventually become a staple of high school reading lists across the United States.”

FIRST DAY OF HEARINGS PUTS PRESSURE ON MODERATE DEMS

Fox News: “All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night, after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats' key witnesses, who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president. At one point in Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., even appeared to embrace hearsay testimony, claiming that ‘hearsay can be much better evidence than direct’ … It was unclear which of those limited exceptions would apply to Wednesday's testimony -- and whether Quigley's argument would persuade critical swing-vote Democrats. … Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence. ‘My constituents expect me to make an objective decision,’ Slotkin said as the hearings concluded…”



Pelosi says Trump committed bribery - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that President Donald Trump committed ‘bribery,’ an impeachable offense, by trying to force Ukraine into tarnishing a political rival to help him in the 2020 election. The speaker’s remark is one of her strongest statements yet on the scandal engulfing Trump that is threatening his presidency. Bribery is one of the specific crimes spelled out in the Constitution as an impeachable offense. ‘I am saying what the president has admitted to and said it’s perfect — it’s perfectly wrong. It’s bribery,’ Pelosi told reporters during her weekly press conference Thursday. … Still, Pelosi cautioned, she isn’t yet ready to say whether the House will vote to impeach Trump, an outcome many lawmakers think is all but certain to happen by the end of this year.”



Report: Republicans discuss prolonging Senate impeachment trial - WaPo: “Some Republican senators and their advisers are privately discussing whether to pressure GOP leaders to stage a lengthy impeachment trial beginning in January to scramble the Democratic presidential race — potentially keeping six contenders in Washington until the eve of the Iowa caucuses or longer. Those conversations about the timing and framework for a trial remain fluid and closely held, according to more than a dozen participants in the discussions. But the deliberations come as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) faces pressure from conservative activists to swat back at Democrats as public impeachment hearings began this week in the House. The discussions raise a potential hazard for the six Democratic senators running for president, who had previously planned on a final sprint out of Washington before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.”



Did anything new come from the hearings? - Fox News: “[Wednesday] offered one previously undisclosed allegation. Career diplomat William Taylor, the charge d’affaires in Kiev, offered testimony, for the first time that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about ‘the investigations,’ to which Sondland supposedly responded that ‘the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.’ Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine. ‘Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,’ Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. ‘At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.’”



What’s next - AP: “Several more witnesses scheduled to testify in the House impeachment hearings over the next week are expected to say they too worried about President Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to investigate Democrats as the U.S. withheld military aid from the country. … On Friday, lawmakers will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in May at Trump’s direction. … Eight more witnesses will testify next week, some in back-to-back hearings on the same day. Among them will be Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council … Gordon Sondland, Trump’s European Union ambassador … and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House who told lawmakers about national security adviser John Bolton’s concerns about Ukraine. … The public hearings are expected to last at least another week.”



White House brings in backup to unify strategy - WashEx: “Newly appointed White House aide Tony Sayegh will try to bring cohesion to a disorderly White House impeachment response… The Washington Examiner has learned that Sayegh, a former Treasury official, will work with the White House communications team, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his staff, and other administration offices to develop and streamline a strategy to dispute allegations and make sure Republicans are on the same page. … Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi was brought in to partner with Sayegh and will be the media face of the anti-impeachment campaign, with plans to leverage her legal background to discredit allegations by House Democrats that the president abused his power in his dealings with Ukraine.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Impeachment and the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses the facts surrounding the impeachment hearings: “The House is operating under rules adopted in 2015, when Republicans ran the House. Schiff is no more secretive about or partisan against the president than my old boss, then-Judiciary chair Rep. Peter Rodino, was toward Nixon or then-Judiciary chair Rep. Henry Hyde was toward Clinton. Both acquired evidence from secret proceedings, and both decided to impeach before any public hearings were held. Impeachment is political, not juridical. Former President Gerald R. Ford was essentially right when he argued that under the Constitution impeachable offenses are whatever a majority of the House says they are -- for Nixon, covering up a break-in; for Clinton, lying about consensual sex; for Trump, solicitation, bribery and obstruction. Whose behavior was arguably the gravest?” More here.



JON HUNTSMAN ANNOUNCES THIRD RUN FOR UTAH GOVERNOR

The Salt Lake Tribune: “Former U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman says he’s grown weary of the national political scene, with its ‘theatrics,’ time-wasting and dearth of meaningful action. Now, he’s asking Utah’s voters to return him to what he calls ‘the best job in the world’ — working as governor. ‘For a very long time, we’ve served our country in the top two diplomatic posts in the world. Now we feel it is time to give back to our home state again,’ Huntsman said on a campaign video posted Thursday morning. He’s vying for a third term as governor in the 2020 election, a little more than 10 years since he last held the post. He previously served as governor from 2005 to 2009. … News leaked Wednesday night that Huntsman would be kicking off his campaign Thursday, and he did with an early call-in to KSL radio and by launching his website and campaign materials.”



RNC jumps in to help Louisiana governor’s race - Politico: “The Republican National Committee is pouring another $1 million into the Louisiana governor’s race ahead of Saturday’s runoff — a move that comes amid mounting GOP concerns about losing a second major election in a conservative state in as many weeks. The last-minute spending doubles the committee’s investment in the race, where Republican Eddie Rispone is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. President Donald Trump is set to headline a rally for Rispone in Louisiana on Thursday evening, barreling ahead despite worries within the GOP that Edwards is a slight favorite to win. Trump had bet that a GOP sweep in three gubernatorial races this fall would project political strength in the face of impeachment. But after Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent defeat in Kentucky last week, and with Rispone locked in a neck-and-neck race, the president is facing the possibility of losing two out of three.”

GOOD PIGGIES

NY Post: “These pigs have a nose for nose candy. Italy’s Il Tirreno reported that authorities believe wild boars in Tuscany have sniffed out some 20,000 euros (about $22,000) worth of cocaine buried in the woods near Montepulciano. Local police learned of the incident after tapping the phone lines of a suspected drug-trafficking group, who revealed the incident during one of their calls. The powder had been stored in jars and tucked into waterproof packages. Allegedly, a boar had stomped the earth where the jars had been buried, which caused the containers to burst, scattering the illicit stimulant across the forest floor. Local officials claim this particular gang is responsible for slinging some two kilograms of blow per month to club-goers around the cities of Arezzo and Siena between September 2018 and March 2019… The drug dealers — one Italian and three Albanians — have been arrested and face charges for drug trafficking.”

With so many questions unanswered, one above all will matter: Will Democrats be able to convince a divided country that President Trump is unworthy of his office and must be impeached?

Of course, that question couldn’t be answered in full just from Day One of the hearings before the House Intelligence Committee. Nevertheless, the pressure was on the Democrats to at least begin producing some of the “goods” on Trump or risk losing the interest of the American people and their support for an impeachment inquiry – let alone their potential support for an impeachment vote.

RNC CHAIR MCDANIEL: AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING, DEMOCRATS PURSUE DELUDED DREAM TO OVERTURN TRUMP’S ELECTION

With that in mind, what was the significance of Day One of the proceedings? Here are the Top 5 takeaways.

There is no bipartisanship among the inquirers

In 1973, Republican Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee was the ranking member of the Senate Watergate Committee. Two years before, President Richard Nixon asked Baker if he wanted to be on the Supreme Court. Despite his alliance with Nixon, during the Watergate hearings, Baker famously asked: “What did the president know and when did he know it?” Despite the enormity of the moment, or because of it, Baker led the way in a bipartisan investigation.

Decades later, it is apparent that none of that bipartisanship exists on the House Intelligence Committee, chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Schiff is certainly no Howard Baker. As of this moment, the two parties are across the proverbial aisle from each other. At the hearing Wednesday, the Democrats pressed their selected opinions and facts and the Republicans pressed theirs. It was “us against them” – with no meeting of the minds. That is likely to continue because . . .

There are a limited number of facts in dispute and few revelations expected

The Watergate hearings, which took place before 24-hour cable news and social media, seemed breathless at the time as revelations unfolded. The impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton occurred while the Internet was still young, involved many aspects, was salacious at times and involved many characters.

By contrast, Day One of the Trump impeachment hearing produced no blockbuster moments – new details yes, but no grand surprise. Why? Two reasons. First, it appears that most of the significant facts are already out in the open through leaks and the release of deposition transcripts. This day might have mattered more if the Democrats had held back their release of information.

Overall, the Republicans were not surprised by Wednesday’s proceedings and Democrats had the day scripted – if not overly scripted. If that holds true for the balance of the proceedings, the Republicans will justifiably maintain their view that nothing impeachable occurred, and the Democrats could be seen as still not delivering the goods.

Beyond that, the public likely will get bored hearing opinion after opinion about the same set of facts. That is a bad omen for the Democrats.

The Democrats case has been reduced to arguing about intent

The Democrats came charging into the day talking about bribery and extortion. However, Day One established that Ukraine got the aid it wanted from President Trump – a lot more than the Democrats and President Obama delivered to the nation.

Ukraine got the aid without having to do anything – no added investigation, no added statement, no nothing. That leaves the Democrats arguing that Trump “intended” to be bad toward Ukraine.

That is a tough sell because, as Day One proved, when President Obama was asked for military aid by Ukraine, he sent blankets because he did not want to antagonize Russia. It also produced this headline in Europe: “Poroshenko asks Obama for weapons, obtains blankets.”

Keep in mind that Obama refused that military aid after attempting to secretly tell Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have “more flexibility” after the next election. Is that not evidence of Obama asking for Russia to not jeopardize his reelection by its actions and words?

Given that, as Day One closed, Americans might rightfully ask: Who was better for Ukraine?

Ukraine was a swamp that enveloped the Bidens and is worthy of investigation

If you didn’t know before that Ukraine had a history of political corruption, it was not possible to watch Day One and not know it now.

That history lesson hurts the Democrats because, as Fox News reported: “State Department official George Kent testified Wednesday that he would ‘love’ to see Ukraine look into the circumstances surrounding the closure of a probe tied to natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, while also raising concerns that Hunter Biden’s role on the board of that firm created the appearance of a conflict of interest.”

Given the Democrats stated refusal to allow an inquiry in these proceedings into the actions of the former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Kent’s statement bolsters the Republican cause for looking into the Bidens and muddies the waters for the Democrats.

Democrats would like to portray themselves as the folks wearing the white hats in these proceedings. If Republicans successfully counter with the actions of the Bidens and the request for dirt on former Trump campaign head Paul Manafort by the Obama administration and the Democratic National Committee, the air could quickly come out of their impeachment balloon.

Few minds were changed

Impeachment is a political process, not a legal process. The Democrats are trying to win a political battle. Were any Republicans' minds changed? Likely not many across the country. How about Democrats? Also, likely nor many in our divided times.

Were the minds of many independents changed? Only time will tell, but this much is true: On balance, this was not a big day for Democrats. Yes, they told the story they wanted to tell. But any reasonable person will see that this is a one-sided affair and that President Trump delivered the military goods to Ukraine to fight Russia.

Day One – when the Democrats had the nation’s attention – did not deliver the political goods the Democrats need to persuade Americans to favor Trump’s impeachment.

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters.

In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent.

Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent.

Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).

The top picks among Hispanics are Sanders (31 percent) and Biden (24 percent), with Warren a distant third (10 percent). Buttigieg garners 1 percent.

Self-identified liberals prefer Biden (25 percent) and Warren (25 percent) over Sanders (18 percent) and Buttigieg (10 percent). Moderates and conservatives like Biden (24 percent) and Sanders (18 percent), with no others hitting double digits.

Sanders is the clear choice for those under age 45, while those 45 and over go for Biden.

CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS

Nominating a candidate who can beat Trump (74 percent extremely important) is far more important to Nevada Democratic voters than one who shares their views on major issues (41 percent extremely important). Biden is the number one choice among both of those groups.

Caucusgoers split 46-46 percent between wanting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach. Legacy voters go heavily for Biden, while those wanting a new approach give a slight edge to Sanders.

More Warren backers (67 percent) are extremely interested in the election than those supporting Biden (62 percent) and Sanders (47 percent).

On the other hand, Biden (70 percent) and Sanders (70 percent) have more “strong” supporters than Warren (61 percent).

Nevada’s February 22 Democratic caucus is 100 days away, soon after elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Fifty-three percent of Nevada voters rate the economy positively, including 22 percent calling it excellent. For comparison, 14 percent of voters nationally rate the economy as excellent.

Meanwhile, more disapprove (52 percent) than approve (45 percent) of the job Trump is doing. His 45 percent approval roughly matches his 2016 vote share, as Hillary Clinton won the Silver State 48-46 percent.

Women help drive Trump’s job rating underwater: 38 percent approve and 60 percent disapprove. Men approve by 53-43 percent, resulting in a 32-point gender gap.

Forty-three percent of Nevadans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached but not removed, and 46 percent oppose impeachment altogether.

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings on impeachment Wednesday.

Despite Trump’s negative job rating, he remains competitive in potential matchups tested. Both Biden (47-40) and Sanders (47-40) have a 7-point advantage over Trump (outside the poll’s margin of error), and Warren is up by 3 (44-41). Buttigieg and Trump tie at 41 percent each. No candidate hits 50 percent and 13-18 percent are undecided or would back a third-party candidate.

Biden and Sanders do better against Trump in large part because of stronger support among men and Hispanics. Among men, Trump bests Biden by 5 points and Sanders by 4, yet he leads Warren by 12 points. Hispanics pick Biden and Sanders over Trump by 26 points, while Warren’s advantage is 18 points.

“These results reinforce the notion that Nevada remains a battleground state,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “But the state’s underlying demographic changes make it challenging for Republicans.”

Warren and Buttigieg are likely hurt by some voters believing it is too soon for a woman (17 percent) or a gay president (41 percent).

Majorities of Nevada voters say the country is ready to elect a female president (76 percent), a Jewish president (67 percent), and a Latino/Hispanic president (67 percent). Views split 46-41 percent over electing a gay or lesbian.

Among Democrats: 83 percent feel the United States is ready to elect a woman president, 68 percent a Jewish leader, 68 percent a Latino/Hispanic candidate, and 53 percent a gay president.

While about two-thirds of Republicans say the country would elect a candidate who is female (66 percent), Jewish (67 percent) or Latino/Hispanic (65 percent), over half think the country isn’t ready for a gay president (35 yes vs. 51 no).

Conducted November 10-13, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,506 Nevada voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. Respondents were randomly selected from a statewide voter file, and 627 were screened to identify potential participants in the Democratic caucus. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for all registered voters and plus or minus 4 points for Democratic caucusgoers."

Graham told ""Hannity"" on Wednesday it would be a key development if the whistleblower was part of any effort to get former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor investigating the natural gas giant that Biden's son, Hunter Biden, had been working for.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY A 'THREAT TO THE PRESIDENCY,' GRAHAM SAYS

If the House votes to impeach President Trump, Graham's committee would play a key role in a Senate trial.

""Here's the question I have about the whistleblower,"" Graham said. ""Was the whistleblower connected to Joe Biden in any way?""

""Here's the question I have about the whistleblower: 'Was the whistleblower connected to Joe Biden in any way?'"" — Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

""Did the whistleblower get himself or herself? ... Did the whistleblower engage in an effort to get the [former] Ukrainian president, Poroshenko, to weigh in and stop the investigation of this gas company? Was there a connection between the whistleblower, Biden, Biden's effort to call Ukraine?""

The South Carolina Republican added the Trump impeachment inquiry cannot be ""legitimized"" if it is based on an anonymous source.

""If you do that, no president will be allowed to survive,"" he said.

""And to my fellow members of Congress, how would you like to be in the shoes of Donald Trump? You're accused of something based on a whistleblower who is anonymous and you can't call witnesses on your behalf.""

He also reiterated his view that legitimizing the impeachment inquiry in its current state would endanger the office of the presidency going forward.

On Tuesday, Graham told ""Hannity"" the allegation President Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukrainian officials is also not true.

""I think it would be a danger to the presidency in the future for us to legitimize what's going on in the House,"" he said.

On Friday, a new voice took a swipe at Biden. Officials in North Korea called him a “rabid dog” that “must be beaten to death with a stick,” according to the Associated Press. It was the latest blow the rogue country has targeted against foreign leaders it views as hostile to the rule of Kim Jong Un.



TIM RYAN ENDORSES BIDEN DESPITE PAST CAMPAIGN TRAIL CRITICISM



The commentary by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said Biden ""reeled off a string of rubbish against the dignity"" of the North's supreme leadership, an act it said deserves ""merciless punishment.""



The editorial referred to Biden (or sometimes ""Baiden"") using only his surname and as the man who served as vice president under Barack Obama.



Back in May, however, the North correctly spelled Biden's name when it labeled him a ""fool of low IQ"" after he called Kim a tyrant during a speech.



The reclusive country often insulted foreign leaders and politicians when it sees what it considers slanderous remarks aimed at its leaders or hostile policies against its government. In addition, the North has made racist or sexist diatribes against Obama and former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, the country's first female leader.



The North reversed this policy concerning President Trump, however, when the nation’s 45th president made diplomatic overtures to Kim in 2018, resulting in three summits. Prior to the overtures, the North Koreans referred to Trump as a “dotard.”



NORTH KOREA WARNS OF ‘BIGGER THREAT AND HARSH SUFFERING’ OVER NUCLEAR TALKS DEADLINE



""Anyone who dare slanders the dignity of the supreme leadership of the D.P.R.K, can never spare the D.P.R.K's merciless punishment whoever and wherever,"" said the North Korean statement, referring to the country by its formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.



""Rabid dogs like Baiden [sic] can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about,” the statement continued. “They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late,"" it said.

It wasn't immediately clear which of Biden's comments provoked North Korea's anger. He’s accused Trump of cozying up to ""dictators and tyrants"" and has been highly critical of his summits with Kim, calling the meetings ""three made-for-TV summits.""

Biden campaign Rapid Response Director Andrew Bates fired back Friday, saying: ""It's becoming more and more obvious that repugnant dictators, as well as those who admire and 'love' them, find Joe Biden threatening. That's because he'd restore American leadership in the world on day one by putting our security, interests, and values at the heart of our foreign policy.""



Speculating further, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency believes North Korea’s Biden insults were an appeal to Trump, who has continued to describe his personal relationship with Kim as good despite a stalemate in nuclear negotiations over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief and disarmament steps.

IMPEACHMENT HEARING TESTIMONY DETAILS TRUMP PURSUIT OF UKRAINE 'INVESTIGATIONS,' AS GOP DECRIES 'SHAM' PROBE

Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings in the House delivered a stark account Wednesday of Trump's pursuit of political ""investigations"" in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani's alleged meddling in that country. For their part, Republicans panned the entire process as a ""low-rent Ukrainian sequel"" to the Russia collusion case and hit back at the claims as mere “hearsay.”

""You can't just lose the leverage of U.S. national security. It's not money. This is not a business deal,"" Williams said. ""This is the president representing us and saying, 'I want to use American dollars to get dirt on my political opponent.'""

Co-host Greg Gutfeld weighed in, defending Trump and emphasizing that ""leverage"" is always implied when it comes to people of power and then making the point a joke at co-host Dana Perino's expense.

Patrick, the former two-term governor of neighboring Massachusetts, said that he’s “a big, big fan of Joe Biden.”

But he noted that the former vice president’s “deep, deep, public empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

DEVAL PATRICK MAKES LATE ENTRY INTO 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

And he took another dig at Biden’s emphasis on ousting President Trump and returning to the normalcy of his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president.

""The instinct that his campaign seems to have to say, to project in effect ‘if we just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent, we can just go back to doing what we used to do,’ misses the moment,"" Patrick argued.

The late entry into the race by Patrick could present a threat to the former vice president. It appears Patrick will run a center-left campaign, fighting for the same voters that Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been successfully courting. And he could give Biden a fight in the former vice president’s early voting state stronghold of South Carolina, where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate.

Patrick could also pose problems for fellow Bay Stater Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts is now a co-front-runner in the polls alongside Biden, with Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also part of the top tier of candidates in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I want to acknowledge my friendship and my enormous respect, in particular with Senator Warren,"" Patrick told Fox News. ""I talked to her last night and I think it was a kind of hard conversation for both of us frankly.”

Asked about the government-run programs that Warren and Sanders are proposing, such as ""Medicare-for-all,"" Patrick praised both of the populist Democratic standard-bearers but added: “I think that if we want solutions that last, they can’t be solutions that feel to the voting public as if they are just Democratic solutions.”

Despite his criticisms of Warren and Biden, Patrick insisted he didn’t want to play the role of a political pundit and emphasized: “Let me be clear about a ground rule for me going forward. I am not trying to climb up by trying to pull anyone else down.”

Patrick also told reporters that he wouldn’t object to an outside group – such as a super PAC that can accept unlimited contributions – assisting his campaign.

“It would be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” he said. “I wish it weren’t so. I wish campaigns weren’t as expensive and I wish that the influence of money that we’ve seen in Washington wasn’t as great as it is.”

Biden has been criticized by many of his rivals for not speaking out against a newly formed super PAC that’s hoping to raise millions of dollars on behalf of the former vice president’s White House bid.

Patrick acknowledged that joining the race late – Iowa kicks off the nominating calendar on Feb. 3, followed eight days later by New Hampshire – presents high hurdles.

“It’s a big and talented field,"" he said. ""It’s hard to break through not just because it’s this stage in the elections, in the campaigns, but it’s hard to break through without being a celebrity or sensational and I’m neither of those things.”

But he highlighted that “voters all across the country in some cases are just tuning in and in many cases haven’t made their decisions.”

And Patrick – a long-shot who went on to win the Massachusetts governorship in the 2006 election – emphasized that “I understand what we have to do but you know what, I’ve lived a political life and I would say as a black man, a whole life dealing with skepticism.”

Patrick served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under President Bill Clinton. After serving his two terms as governor, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Patrick’s tenure at the firm will likely be in the spotlight in the 2020 race.

Asked about the liability, Patrick told reporters “I smile because when I was co-chair of the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012 and there was all the attacks on Bain Capital on account of Mitt Romney, I was asked about that and I didn’t buy it then and I don’t buy it now.

The former governor mulled launching a presidential campaign last year, assembling a team of advisers and enjoying the backing of some of former President Barack Obama’s top political aides. But late last year, Patrick announced he wouldn’t run, pointing to the “cruelty of our elections process.”

Patrick said “I was ready to go last year… we got really, really close.” But he noted that just two weeks before Thanksgiving, his wife Diane was diagnosed with uterine cancer “and it’s the sort of thing that brings you right back to earth and I felt that the right thing to do for her, for us, was to focus on that.”

He explained that his wife is now cancer free."

That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters.

In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided.

Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.

“As North Carolina has grown in recent years, it’s developed into one of the most competitive states in the country,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who partners with Democrat Chris Anderson on the Fox News Poll. “It’s difficult to think of a scenario where Trump wins re-election without carrying the state.”

Roughly equal numbers of North Carolina voters approve (47 percent) of Trump’s job performance as disapprove (50 percent).

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 3 percent say impeached but not removed, and 47 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (89 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor (79 percent).

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings Wednesday.

Turning to the Democratic race, strong support among African American voters gives Biden a commanding lead in North Carolina’s primary, which will be held March 3, 2020.

Overall, Biden captures 37 percent among Democratic primary voters, more than double the support of any competitor. Warren receives 15 percent and Sanders 14 percent.

Buttigieg garners 6 percent and Kamala Harris 4 percent. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang stand at 2 percent apiece. Michael Bennett, Steve Bullock, and Amy Klobuchar each receive 1 percent.

About half of black voters support Biden (49 percent). That’s more than 30 points higher than Warren and Sanders (12 percent each).

Biden also leads among voters over age 65 (+39 points), moderates (+20), and whites (+11).

The only group Warren wins is self-described “very liberals,” and even here she narrowly tops Sanders (by 4 points) and Biden (by 5 points).

Sanders’ only win is among voters under age 35, where he bests Biden by 10.

“Polling outside of the early states illustrates what broad goodwill Democratic primary voters have for Biden, especially among black voters,” says Anderson. “Places where campaigning is currently less intense, he starts with a built-in advantage that could pay dividends once the primaries move beyond the early states.”

North Carolina Democrats split 45-45 percent when choosing between a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach.

Biden is the favorite by 29 points among those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy and by 14 points for those favoring a new approach.

Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democratic primary voters say it is extremely important to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump compared to 41 percent who feel it is extremely important the nominee shares their views on major issues.

North Carolina Senate

By a 40-35 percent margin, North Carolina voters approve of the job Republican incumbent Thom Tillis is doing as their senator. One in four (25 percent) is unsure, including 22 percent of Republicans.

Elected in 2014, Tillis is facing two challengers in the senate primary. He leads with the support of 54 percent of GOP primary voters, while Garland Tucker receives 11 percent and Sandy Smith 4 percent. Twenty-six percent are undecided and 5 percent say other.

Things are more uncertain on the other side, as the three declared Democrats are all under 20 percent: Erica Smith receives 18 percent, Cal Cunningham 13 percent, and Trevor Fuller 10 percent. Most Democratic primary voters are undecided (49 percent) or say they will support someone else (10 percent).

Is the U.S. electorate an equal opportunity employer? Two-thirds of North Carolina voters think the country is ready to elect a woman president. That drops to 54 percent for a Jewish president, 49 percent a Latino/Hispanic president, and 30 percent a gay/lesbian president.

By a 24-point margin, more Democrats than Republicans believe the nation is ready for a woman president. Democrats are also more likely to say Americans are ready to elect someone who is Jewish (by 7 points), Latino/Hispanic (by 11 points), or gay (by 17 points).

""I wanted the American people to see that these [William Taylor and Gordon Kent] were two patriots who came before Congress, despite the president telling them not to, to share what they saw as far as wrongdoing,"" Swalwell said. ""I thought Ambassador Taylor said it best, which was that the shakedown scheme by the president was just wrong, but that they don't have dogs in the fight. They're career public servants. They've served all over the world.""

THE IMPEACHMENT HEARING WITNESSES: WHO IS BILL TAYLOR?

Kent and Taylor testified on the opening day of public impeachment inquiry hearings and delivered a stark account of President Trump's pursuit of political ""investigations"" in Ukraine, as well as Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's alleged meddling in U.S. policy toward the Eastern European nation, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ""low-rent Ukrainian sequel"" to the Russia investigation and hit back at the claims as mere “hearsay.”

Swalwell said if the president is ""innocent"" he would send acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton to testify.

""If the president of the United States is innocent, he will send the firsthand witnesses, John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, to Congress,"" Swalwell said. ""If he's guilty, they'll stop us from hearing it, hard stop.""

""What about executive privilege?"" MacCallum asked. ""Those people obviously work very closely with the president.""

""Executive privilege does not cover wrongdoing or crimes. It certainly does not cover people who are no longer in the White House. And we're talking to other people who were not the president,"" Swalwell said. ""You know, again, [for] the president, the interest here is not executive privilege, it's CYA.""

Swalwell also dismissed the idea of investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's involvement with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.

""I don't think we should chase the president's conspiracy theories, especially when Mr. Kent said Mr. Biden was only carrying out the foreign policy of the United States,"" Swalwell said.

MacCallum pressed the congressman as to whether or not he would investigate an offspring of President Trump if the situation was similar.

""I'm saying if they had never been in those businesses before and they got into them only after their father became president, wouldn't you want to investigate that?"" MacCallum asked.

""I would want to go through formal channels,"" Swalwell answered."

TRUMP CASTS LOUISIANA VOTE AS IMPEACHMENT REFERENDUM

USA Today: “President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. … ‘The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,’ Trump said. ‘Let's keep it going for a while.’ … Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. … ‘You gotta give me a big win please,’ Trump told the crowd. ‘Please.’”



Will black voters rally for Edwards? - FiveThirtyEight: “While election forecasters like Sabato’s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that’s not the only thing that matters for Edwards’ candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. … And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.”



Bevin cries uncle - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “An upbeat Andy Beshear claimed victory — again — in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he would not contest the results of the close election. ‘The race is now officially over,’ Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.”



New map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: “Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. ‘I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,’ said Republican Rep. David Lewis, one of the legislature’s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps. As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.”



TRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION

Fox News: “Roger Stone was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks’ possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump’s campaign.”



Tensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: “Tensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of ‘gagging’ the lawmaker. … The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine… Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked ‘turned bad.’ Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it ‘witness intimidation.’ Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ‘It's very intimidating.’”



Legal woes mount for Giuliani - Bloomberg: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.”



Career White House budget official to testify - WaPo: “A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.”

“If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm, from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections, than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 61



TIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY

Smithsonian: “Founded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol’s] primary product—a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper—was no longer in demand and the firm’s future looked bleak. Fortunately, the sister-in-law of one of its principals had an idea: let kids play with it. Kutol Products had become the largest wallpaper cleaner manufacturer in the world in the early 20th century. Fortunes began to change in the 1950s, though. With the transition from heating with dirtier coal to cleaner oil, gas and electricity, sooty buildup on wallpaper was no longer an issue in many households. Joseph McVicker was trying to turn around the struggling company when his sister-in-law read an article about how wallpaper cleaner could be used for modeling projects. Sister-in-law Kay Zufall, a nursery school teacher, tested the nontoxic material with children, who loved molding it into all kinds of shapes. She told McVicker of her discovery and even suggested a new name: Play-Doh.”

BIDEN BREACHES WARREN’S NEVADA FIREBREAK

Fox News: “Democrats’ strong desire for a candidate who can defeat President Trump gives Joe Biden the edge in the nomination race, while Hispanic voters help both Biden and Bernie Sanders top Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups. That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).”



Poll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump - Fox News: “North Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.”



North Korean news agency calls Biden a ‘rabid dog’ - ABC News: “After a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied Kim Jong Un was a ‘tyrant,’ North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a ‘rabid dog’ and advocated that rabid dogs ‘can hurt lots of people’ and ‘must be beaten to death with a stick.’ … The ad for Biden said, in part: ‘We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised -- our allies, pushed aside.’ Kim's photo appears at the mention of the word ‘tyrants.’ The Biden campaign hit back, calling Kim a ‘repugnant dictator,’ arguing that sharp words from North Korea highlight the strength of their candidate.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Mr. Stirewalt: Why doesn't the President simply claim whistleblower status for himself? U.S. law prohibits adverse actions against anyone reporting suspicion of wrongdoing. I looked -- it doesn't say the report must be made to a US authority. … Clearly, the President disclosed information that he believed evidenced violation of ANY law (including the law of Ukraine), a gross waste of funds, and an abuse of authority. He should therefore be protected against any adverse action as a result. (I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like a gift-wrapped solution . . . am I missing something?)” – Michael Whalen, Weirton, W. Va.



[Ed. note: I’m not sure how facetious you’re being, Mr. Whalen, but this note will always make allowances for readers from West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle! I guess I’d have to ask in reply: Protection from what? If it’s protection from Congress that you seek, I’m afraid not. Congress’ power to impeach is absolute. The president does have many protections in dealing with Congress – shielding intimate advisers from testifying about private conversations, etc. – but when it comes to impeachment, Congress is at the apex of its powers. Go Red Riders!]

SEE, COWS

AFP: “Three cows swept into the ocean when Hurricane Dorian struck the US east coast in September were found living on a string of sandy islands miles away from their home… The bovine trio is believed to have swum four to five miles before placing hoof on land – in this case an island of sand dunes and scattered vegetation that is part of North Carolina's Outer Banks… The animals were recently discovered by park rangers at the Cape Lookout National Seashore... Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm. Category One Hurricane Dorian created a ‘mini-tsunami’ that swept cattle and some 30 wild horses from Cedar Island into the ocean when it struck on September 6. The cows were identified by their keeper, Woody Hancock. They will likely be sedated and sent home on a boat…”

But if the State Department’s George Kent and Acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor are representative of the testimony Democrats are relying on, future historians may label this episode The Big Impeachment Blowout.

The House impeachment inquiry is not a criminal proceeding. But as I listened to the hearsay and speculation that Kent and Taylor were offering Wednesday at the opening public hearing on impeachment, I couldn’t help thinking of REO Speedwagon’s song “Take it on the Run.”

One line of the song says: “Heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend who heard it from another you been messin’ around.”

YOVANOVITCH TO FACE GOP GRILLING ON SECOND DAY OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Both Kent and Taylor admitted they never talked to President Trump and only heard third-hand what supposedly occurred in the president’s July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats seem to have dropped the quid pro quo claim, since there was no evidence of it in the rough transcript the White House released of the call. The claim does not seem to be playing with the American public.

Taylor admitted in the hearing that Zelensky had no idea that U.S. aid was being delayed, and Zelensky himself has said there was no quid pro quo.

Democrats have now switched to using the terms “bribery” and “extortion,” no doubt because those terms sound more sinister, despite the fact that they’ve produced no evidence – so far – that would come even close to showing a violation of the federal laws defining bribery and extortion.

Both witnesses expressed their opinions disagreeing with the way President Trump has conducted diplomatic relations with Ukraine and the handling of U.S. aid to the country.

But the president is not a postman for Congress or the State Department. His job is to faithfully execute the law. As the chief diplomat of the United States, he defines our foreign policy, not George Kent or William Taylor.

Our country doesn’t give money or aid to other countries for no reason. We give it with specific conditions attached.

The president has a duty to make sure that our money is going to countries that will use it as we intend and not divert it into profiteering and personal corruption. State Department bureaucrats have never been good at ensuring that countries prevent such corruption.

The priority of our diplomats is to maintain their access to government officials in the countries in which they are stationed. This too often overrides their duty to guard against corruption. The president has the final responsibility for ensuring U.S. aid is not improperly diverted in other nations.

It was widely known that Ukraine had, and still has, a corruption problem. It would have been irresponsible for Trump not to look into corruption and demand changes before our money went there.

Even Kent admitted in his testimony that Burisma, the Ukrainian company that employed Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter as a highly paid board member, was part of the “pervasive and longstanding corruption in Ukraine.”

Of course, we will not hear any facts about that because Chairman Schiff has refused to allow the Republicans to call Hunter Biden as a witness, which would enable the younger Biden’s possible self-dealing in Ukraine to be investigated.

If everything Hunter Biden and his father Joe did was ethical and above board when it came to Ukraine, why wouldn’t Democrats want Hunter Biden to testify?

And why has Schiff’s committee blocked the Republicans from being able to call the so-called whistleblower who started this whole show-trial that Democrats call an impeachment inquiry? What are they afraid will come out about this government employee that might damage his credibility and the claims he is making?

Apparently, Schiff doesn’t want any testimony that would support the legitimacy of the president’s corruption concerns about Ukraine or would somehow detract from the impeachment narrative Democrats are trying to weave into the minds of the American public.

We certainly won’t have an objective, bipartisan inquiry into all of the relevant aspects of what happened here – and why it happened. Schiff even interrupted Republican questioning to tell witnesses they should not answer questions based on “facts not in evidence,” a bizarre statement given the nature of a congressional hearing and how it is normally conducted.

Adam Schiff used to be an assistant U.S. attorney – a federal prosecutor. Like all people in that position, he had to follow the U.S. Attorneys’ Justice Manual.

Before taking a case to a grand jury, much less to trial, Schiff had to convince his boss, in writing, that he had evidence establishing a case. He couldn’t just wing it and submit a case, however weak, based entirely on hearsay, to the grand jury on the off-chance it would indict.

Yet that is exactly what Schiff is doing here – throwing witnesses into closed and now open hearings hoping that he can stir the political pot into an impeachment boil.

It would undermine our system of government for a duly elected president to be removed through impeachment for partisan reasons.

Impeachment should only be used when there has been serious, substantial misconduct of such a nature that we can’t wait for the next election. As far as is publicly known at this time, that standard has not been met regarding President Trump.

Deval Patrick into the race, further dividing Democrats in their battle to pick a nominee to challenge President Trump in 2020.

This is good news for Trump, especially if it causes the crowded field to devolve into a bitter negative campaign. The more time Democrats spend attacking each other, the less time they have to attack the president.

In addition, Trump would be able to use the attacks by Democrats on their eventual nominee in ads when he runs against that person next year.

DEVAL PATRICK JUMPS INTO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Patrick is a former assistant U.S. attorney general and was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, becoming the first African-American to hold that position.

Former New York City Mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hasn’t made an official declaration of his candidacy yet, but seems certain to do so in the near future. He’s already filed to run in at least two states and is reportedly hiring staff across the country.

And 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the BBC that she’s “under enormous pressure” to run again in 2020, and has refused to rule it out. But it seems unlikely that the former first lady, senator and secretary state will make a third presidential run at this late date, although it’s understandable why she could find it tempting.

Not counting Bloomberg and Clinton, 17 Democrats remain in the race for their party’s presidential nomination, though most have virtually no chance of winning the contest. Eight other Democrats have dropped out of the nomination race even before the first votes are cast.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., are atop the polls in the presidential contest. Right now it looks like only a handful of other candidates have even a longshot chance of capturing the nomination.

Patrick joins the Democratic race with the rumored tacit blessing of former President Barack Obama, who may be frustrated by the failure of any other candidate – particularly Biden, his vice president – to both consolidate the field and demonstrate a clear ability to defeat President Trump.

But there is evidence that Democratic primary voters are actually happy with the current crop of candidates.

The most recent Fox News Poll showed 69 percent of Democrats are satisfied with the field as it now stands. That’s particularly true among the more liberal wing of the party – which is split between supporters of self-described democratic socialist Sanders and Warren. Among the liberals, 71 percent are satisfied with the field.

More moderate Democrats appear slightly less satisfied than liberals. The polls suggest they’d be fine with Biden, particularly given his apparent strength against Trump in the general election.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off.

However, there’s a nagging feeling about Biden. Yes, he was exceedingly effective in both the 2008 and 2012 vice presidential candidate debates. But that was a long time ago. He will turn 77 on Wednesday and is showing his age, stumbling a few times in past debates and appearances and sometimes looking like he is past his prime.

The age issue has also been raised with Sanders, who is 78 and is back on the campaign trail after recently suffering a heart attack. It would certainly be raised with Bloomberg, who is 77, and could be raised with Warren, who is 70. However, the 73-year-old Trump would have a hard time attacking any of these candidates as being too old to be president.

Despite Biden’s imperfect performance to date, none of the other center-left candidates – I call them the “junior Bidens” – has managed to achieve real prominence.

Buttigieg has done extremely well in appearances and seems to have a very effective organization in Iowa. But only 30 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say he can beat Trump – compared to 68 percent who say that about Biden, and almost 60 percent who say that about Sanders and Warren.

That leaves running room – or at least dreaming room – for Patrick and Bloomberg. Can you blame either one for looking in the mirror each morning and thinking he can beat Biden?

Patrick had a strong and moderate, record as governor of Massachusetts. Though he starts with no organization and little money, he is hoping for a solid showing in Iowa and to then eclipse Biden in New Hampshire, which borders Massachusetts.

If Patrick makes a credible showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’d be in a position to win the South Carolina primary, where about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black. However, right now Biden enjoys very strong support among black voters – outpacing African-American candidates who joined the race months ago – so it would be premature to assume Patrick would come out on top in South Carolina.

One potential weakness for Patrick is that he just left a partnership at Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Yes, Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, former GOP presidential nominee, and current senator from Utah.

Patrick will certainly get attacked for his work at Bain by Sanders and Warren, who have proposed a slew of new taxes on wealthy individuals and on businesses, along with new regulations on the private sector.

However, I have trouble seeing how a caricature of a “rich fat cat” will stick to Patrick, who is the son of a single mother living in the Chicago projects, and who won scholarships to a fancy prep school and Harvard.

Still, the polls in New Hampshire suggest Patrick is not well-known there, despite an eight-year track record as governor next door.

And unlike Bloomberg, Patrick will need to expend significant time and effort raising money.

The smart money says it’s too late for Patrick to become the Democratic presidential nominee.

My own sense is that if Patrick can raise the contributions and hit the poll numbers needed to get into one of the upcoming Democratic presidential candidate debates, his optimistic message might enable him to beat the odds. Primary politics is a strange beast – and, yes, lightning does sometimes strike.

Remember that when then-Sen. Barack Obama first announced his presidential candidacy, many “experts” said America was not ready to elect a black president. And when Trump first announced he was running for president many pundits wrote him off as a publicity-seeking reality-TV star with no chance of getting the Republican nomination.

Bloomberg, whose net worth is said to be north of $50 billion, has the advantage of being able to write a check to amply fund his campaign and mount a multistate effort. However, his intention to self-fund will keep him out of Democratic presidential debates unless the rules to qualify are changed. That would present him with a big disadvantage.

At the same time, Bloomberg’s opposition to many of the far-left proposals of Sanders and Warren may wind up helping those two candidates more than hurting them with the liberal Democratic electorate.

“With enemies like Mike, he’ll wind up deepening their support,” one wag joked, about Sanders and Warren, “and here we thought they’ve renounced super PACs.”

The recent Fox News poll suggested that only 6 percent of Democratic primary voters would definitely support Bloomberg, while 32 would “never vote for him.” That’s a big disadvantage to overcome.

Bloomberg’s strategy is based on not entering any contests until the Super Tuesday primaries March 3 – after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina vote.

Sixteen states – including the two most populous, California and Texas – hold primaries on Super Tuesday. They will divide up roughly 36 percent of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The four early states will have only about 4 percent of convention delegates.

Bloomberg’s hope is that no two candidates will emerge as strong contenders after the first four nominating contests. Given how quickly previous nomination contests have been defined by the initial results, I wouldn’t put too much stock in that hope. Few things are certain in politics, but Iowa will winnow the field, and New Hampshire will likely define it.

Of course, politics remains unpredictable, with new developments able to shake up races significantly.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off. This unpredictability is one of the things that makes politics so interesting.

A group of senators led by Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee Vice Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said they are ""disappointed"" by the Pentagon's decision not to open up an investigation despite the urging of Durbin, Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and several others to do so.

DEFENSE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAYS PENTAGON RECEIVED 'PHONE CALLS FROM INDUSTRY' AFTER HOLD ON UKRAINE AID

The senators met with Acting IG Glenn Fine in late October and sent multiple letters to him urging the department to investigate.

Fine responded in a letter on Tuesday -- the eve of the first day of public impeachment hearings against President Trump -- saying that the issues raised in the meetings and letters are ""significant,"" but that the department seeks ""not to duplicate or interfere with the efforts of other oversight entities, even if there is not a criminal proceeding, before initiating our own investigation.""

The heads of three House committees -- Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs.-- are currently leading the investigation into whether Trump prodded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into former Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, his son Hunter and their business ties in Ukraine in exchange for military aid.

TRUMP VOWS NEW UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE IN POST-IMPEACHMENT HEARING PRESS CONFERENCE

Fine, who has served as the inspector general for the Department of Justice for 11 years, explained that although he has conducted investigations in the past that have overlapped with other congressional reviews, those investigations were typically initiated before any congressional inquiries, noting that impeachment ""is not a typical oversight investigation.""

Still, Fine did not dismiss the possibility of a separate investigation entirely, instead saying that the department would consider looking into the matter further ""as circumstances evolve and the congressional inquiry proceeds."""

This is the main takeaway from the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry of President Trump that moves into its second day of public hearings Friday. More witnesses are certain to confirm Trump’s misconduct.

The unfortunate truth is that instead of pursuing America’s national interest by giving Ukraine nearly $400 million in assistance to resist invading Russian military forces, Trump tried to extort Zelensky to benefit Trump’s personal political interests. This is not what our presidents are supposed to do.

TRUMP HAMMERS DEMS FOR IMPEACHMENT FOCUS AT LOUISIANA RALLY: 'WE DID NOTHING WRONG -- AND THEY'RE DOING NOTHING'

Trump saw former Vice President Joe Biden as his likely Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, and so sought to get Zelensky to launch an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter (who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company) that would smear the former vice president’s reputation and make Biden less likely to be elected president.

Trump’s action was unquestionably improper, and many people – including me – believe it was illegal.

The Democratic-controlled House will have to decide this issue when it votes on whether to impeach Trump. If it does, the Republican-controlled Senate will have to hold a trial to determine if Trump’s conduct warrants his removal from office.

No president has ever been removed from office by Congress, though President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 to avoid likely removal if he had gone to trial in the Senate in the Watergate scandal.

Trump’s Republican defenders in the House and Senate argue that since Trump eventually released the aid to Ukraine without getting Ukraine to investigate the Bidens he did nothing wrong.

But as Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said at the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearing Wednesday: “Is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted robbery a crime? Is attempted bribery and extortion a crime?”

We all know the answers to these questions: yes, yes and yes.

Trump’s attempted crime was interrupted by a whistleblower filing a complaint about the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call and news stories disclosing this. Without the whistleblower complaint, all indications are that Zelensky would have ordered the investigation of the Bidens – along with an investigation of a debunked claim that Ukraine interfered in our 2016 presidential election on behalf of Hillary Clinton.

Trump demanded both investigations in return for giving Ukraine the U.S. aid that had been approved by Congress, and had blocked the release of the aid as part of his plan to extort Zelensky to meet his demands. Only disclosure of the Trump attempted extortion prompted him to give Ukraine the aid it desperately needed.

At Wednesday’s impeachment hearing, acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent were perfect witnesses and gave damning testimony against President Trump.

Trump’s action was unquestionably improper, and many people – including me – believe it was illegal.

Taylor and Kent came off as nonpartisan, patriotic, researched and consistent. Their attention to detail was on full display, having taken copious notes documenting every aspect of their experience with Trump’s wrongful conduct regarding Ukraine.

Taylor even came with new information since his closed-door deposition in late October that gave additional fodder to the central charge of this impeachment inquiry: President Trump was trading arms for dirt on his political opponent.

Taylor reported that his aide David Holmes heard U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland on the phone with Trump on July 26 discussing the investigations Trump wanted into the Bidens and our 2016 election.

Holmes then asked Sondland what the president “thought about Ukraine.” According to Taylor, ""Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.”

The Associated Press reported Thursday that a second diplomatic staffer, Suriya Jayanti, also overheard the conversation between Sondland and Trump. Trump has said he doesn’t recall this July 26 call, the day after his conversation with Zelensky.

Doesn’t recall? That sure is convenient.

I expect Ambassador Sondland will be amending his testimony one more time to account for these new details.

Protest as Republicans might, all the dots have been connected to show Trump’s unquestionable misconduct. The timeline that exists now is incredibly damaging to Trump.

February: Congress approves $391 million in military aid to Ukraine.

Feb. 28: Trump tells Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that the aid to Ukraine will be released immediately.

July 25: The Trump-Zelensky phone call takes place. Trump mentions the Bidens and tells the Ukrainian president “I would like you to do us a favor though” and launch investigations, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.

Sept. 9: The Justice Department informs the House of the whistleblower complaint raising serious concerns about the Trump-Zelensky call.

Sept. 11: Trump releases the congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine.

The order of events is critical to undermining the Republicans’ argument, since they have been relying on the fact that there couldn’t have been a quid pro quo because U.S. military aid was released without investigations.

As the timeline shows, Trump’s attempted crime was interrupted by the whistleblower complaint being filed. What’s more, our legal system holds people accountable for attempted crimes. Plenty of people are serving time in our prisons and jails for crimes they tried but failed to carry out because they were foiled in the act.

Republicans have also been arguing that since Zelensky said much later that he didn’t feel pressured by Trump in the July 25 call, nothing inappropriate had happened. It is obvious Zelensky said that because he feared angering Trump, which could create future problems for Ukraine.

But after Wednesday’s testimony, we know that the Ukrainians were acutely aware of what was happening with the withholding of vital U.S. aid, and felt pressure to do the bidding of Trump and Trump’s personal attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Not only did Giuliani publicly state that these investigations would be “very helpful” to Trump, but Taylor testified that Sondland told him that he had personally encouraged Zelensky to make it clear to Trump that Zelensky was committed to the investigations.

Additionally, Ukraine’s national security adviser told Taylor that Zelensky did not wish to be a pawn in a U.S. political campaign five days before the call occurred. By September, there are a number of indications that not only did the Ukrainians feel pressured, but they also knew that the American aid had been frozen, according to the testimony of Taylor and Tim Morrison, formerly of the National Security Council.

Republicans tried desperately at the Wednesday hearing to divert attention from the real issues at hand by promoting conspiracy theories like the claim that the Ukrainians interfered in our 2016 election or that there was something sinister going on vis-à-vis the Bidens and gas company Burisma.

Kent and Taylor quickly knocked down these claims. But I expect that Republicans will continue to promote these fairytales that make the president seem a little bit less corrupt to his base.

Now the truth has come out. And more will come out as more witnesses testify about President Trump’s misconduct.

Because the Senate would need the votes of 20 Republicans to remove Trump from office if he is impeached by the House, the odds are that he will remain in office.

But the House impeachment inquiry will shed needed light on how Trump has improperly used his office for his personal benefit, giving voters important information to consider when they cast ballots in the 2020 presidential election.

That is almost certain to remain the case at the conclusion of impeachment proceedings against President Trump that began public hearings Wednesday in the House of Representatives.

President Richard Nixon would likely have been removed in the Watergate scandal if he was impeached by the House and went on trial in the Senate, but he resigned in 1974 to avoid that.

Only two presidents have been impeached by the House – Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998, but both were acquitted when they went on trial in the Senate. At this time, this looks to be the likely outcome of impeachment proceedings against Trump.

If Trump’s impeachment ends without removal by the Senate – following the pattern of Johnson and Clinton – Democrats could be blamed for dragging the nation through a futile ordeal to remove Trump and then lose seats in the 2020 elections – as Republicans did after failing to convict Clinton.

RNC CHAIR MCDANIEL: AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING, DEMOCRATS PURSUE DELUDED DREAM TO OVERTURN TRUMP’S ELECTION

In the televised impeachment hearings that began in the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday, we saw two distinguished and long-serving U.S. diplomats – acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent – carefully and unemotionally describe what they witnessed.

We saw a few minor squabbles between Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican committee members who questioned his exclusion of their witnesses and lines of questioning.

But overall the hearings were relatively monotonous and made little progress on substance.

Few people will have changed their minds after watching all six hours of Wednesday’s testimony.

The facts remain the same.

On July 25, President Trump made a phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the course of the conversation, Trump asked for “a favor,” according to a rough transcript released by the White House.

The favor? That Zelensky investigate why Ukrainian prosecutors had not investigated the appointment of the unqualified Hunter Biden (son of then-Vice President Joe Biden) to a cushy spot on the board of the Burisma natural gas firm – reportedly at a salary of about $50,000 per month.

The Trump White House temporarily delayed nearly $400 million in U.S. foreign and military aid to Ukraine until the public announcement of the investigations. But the Ukrainians never announced or conducted such investigations, and the White House eventually released the funds. As a result, Trump provided far more effective assistance for Ukraine’s struggle against Russian aggression than the administration of President Barack Obama ever did.

Most of this story is already widely known, thanks to Democratic legislative malpractice. House Intelligence Committee Democrats had conducted depositions of Kent, Taylor and others behind closed doors, with little participation by the minority Republicans.

But Democrats then released their witnesses’ written testimony, after earlier leaking the high points of the questioning. With no new testimony, and all civil servants doing their best to be bland and nonpartisan (which, after all, is their job), the hearings Wednesday primarily only repeated what the news media had already published and broadcast.

The Wednesday televised hearing also provided few critical facts because of the White House’s decision to release the rough transcript of the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call, which reduced much of the public testimony to providing color and context to facts already known.

Take, for example, the “news” that Taylor had learned from staff of an overheard July 26 phone call between Trump and America’s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland. Trump allegedly asked Sondland about the “investigations,” and Sondland reportedly replied that the Ukrainians were “ready to move forward.”

When the aide asked Sondland what Trump thought of Ukraine, the ambassador reportedly replied that Trump cares “more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,” referring to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But this should come as no surprise.

The July 25 transcript already made clear that Trump cared enough about the investigations to raise the issue directly with President Zelensky.

And the already unreliable Sondland, who has had to correct his testimony and may be in the habit of exaggerating his role, added another level of hearsay to the tale. This made front-page headlines.

Unfortunately, the public hearings and the news coverage have focused on these marginal developments and have ignored the central question: do these facts justify President Trump’s impeachment and removal from office?

Impeachment is a two-step process.

First the House starts the process by impeaching the president on a charge of treason, bribery, or other “high Crimes” or “misdemeanors.” This is akin to bringing a criminal charge.

If a president is impeached – as happened with Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton – the Constitution says the Senate has “the sole power to try” the case. The constitutional text underscores that the Senate plays a judicial role by including the word “try,” requiring the chief justice of the United States to preside at the president’s trial, and referring to “the Party convicted” if the Senate decides to remove the president from office.

Removal requires an affirmative vote by two-thirds of the senators present. If all 100 senators vote, that amounts to 67 votes needed to remove a president from office. Democrats and independents aligned with them control 47 seats in the Senate – meaning they would need the support of at least 20 Republican senators to remove Trump from office.

It seems clear that the type of conduct at issue here involving President Trump and Ukraine could supply the grounds for impeachment. The framers of the Constitution openly worried about a president who might use his foreign affairs powers for personal or political gain.

The framers had seen France’s King Louis XIV pay Britain’s King Charles II to remain neutral in the European wars. They believed that “high crimes and misdemeanors” – the grounds for impeachment and removal of a president – included abuse of the executive’s control over foreign policy.

But our nation’s founders also believed that impeachment should only come as a last resort. They expected that the American people would hold a president accountable for any abuses of power at the ballot box.

“At the end of four years, [the president] may be turned out of his office,” Gov. Edmund Randolph said during the 1788 Virginia convention called to ratify the Constitution. “If he misbehaves he may be impeached, and in this case he will never be reelected.”

Defenders of the Constitution designed impeachment to be a rare event, especially by making the requirement for removal a two-thirds vote of the Senate for treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors, rather than “maladministration,” in their words.

The Federalists worried that the president otherwise would become too dependent on a Congress eager to use impeachment to fight political and partisan disputes.

It is on this point where the House impeachment hearings have proven so disappointing. House Democrats have not shown why a quid pro quo that never succeeded (assuming the facts in the worst light for the White House) and that involved a relatively small country at the periphery of American security interests should justify removal of a president, the undoing of the results of the 2016 election, and the preemption of the people’s verdict on Trump in 2020."

In between were tense squabbles among lawmakers over the rules for the impeachment hearing proceedings, with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, at one point snapping at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that his party's ""indulgence with you wore out a long time ago.""

And Republicans were able to extract some noteworthy statements from the witness, including an admission that despite allegations President Trump withheld support to Ukraine in exchange for politically advantageous investigations, it was Trump – not his predecessor, Barack Obama – who ultimately provided “defensive lethal aid” to Kiev.

TRUMP ATTACKS MARIE YOVANOVITCH DURING IMPEACHMENT HEARING, SAYS EVERYWHERE SHE WENT 'TURNED BAD'

But while Yovanovitch testified that she was “kneecapped” by the administration – with some choice words for Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – and Democrats sought to draw attention to what they called the “smear campaign” against her, the day in Washington largely turned on the early-morning Trump tweets. Shortly after the hearing began, Trump fired back in real time, claiming that every place Yovanovitch worked ""turned bad.""

He charged: “She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.”

Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Schiff read Trump's tweet during the hearing, and called it “witness intimidation.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., when asked about the tweet, echoed: ""Witness intimidation is a crime.""

Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ""It's very intimidating."" Democrats on the sidelines of the hearing crowed that the tweet itself could prompt a new article of impeachment against the president.

But the White House fired back at the claims, with Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham declaring: “The tweet was not witness intimidation, it was simply the President’s opinion, which he is entitled to.” She went on to say, ""This is not a trial, it is a partisan political process - or to put it more accurately, a totally illegitimate, charade stacked against the President. There is less due process in this hearing than any such event in the history of our country. It’s a true disgrace.”

It remains to be seen whether that moment and the fallout from it will fuel Democrats’ impeachment case or fade as a parade of other witnesses appear next week before the same committee. But the incident reflected an escalating political environment, with Democrats eager to turn Trump’s trademark attack-mode against him.

Republicans acknowledged the Trump tweet was not helpful, with one senior GOP source telling Fox News: “We didn’t need that.” But Republicans nevertheless worked to draw out witness statements to support their general argument that no quid pro quo took place because, despite Trump’s conversations, the aid to Ukraine was delivered – after a delay – without the investigations he sought.

THE IMPEACHMENT HEARING WITNESSES: WHO IS MARIE YOVANOVITCH?

Earlier in the hearing, Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who has served both Republican and Democratic presidents, relayed in detail her story of being suddenly recalled by Trump in May, saying she believes Giuliani played a key role in telling people she was not sufficiently supportive of the president.

“I do not understand Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me, nor can I offer an opinion on whether he believed the allegations he spread about me,” Yovanovitch said.

She argued the efforts against her by the president's allies hindered her work.

“If our chief representative is kneecapped, it limits our effectiveness to safeguard the vital national security interests of the United States,” Yovanovitch said.

Yovanovitch's removal is one of several events at the center of the impeachment effort.

""These events should concern everyone in this room,"" Yovanovitch said in her opening remarks. ""Shady interests the world over have learned how little it takes to remove an American ambassador who does not give them what they want.""

Democrats have worked to connect the circumstances of Yovanovitch’s ouster to Trump’s alleged pressure campaign to enlist Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an effort to damage potential 2020 rival Joe Biden.

“Some have argued, that a president has the ability to nominate or remove any ambassador he wants, that they serve at the pleasure of the president. And that is true,” Schiff said. “The question before us is not whether Donald Trump could recall an American ambassador with a stellar reputation for fighting corruption in Ukraine, but why would he want to?”

Republicans portrayed the hearing as a waste of time.

“It’s unfortunate that today, and for most of next week, we will continue engaging in the Democrats’ day-long TV spectacles instead of solving the problems we were all sent to Washington to address,” Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

Kayleigh McEnany, Trump campaign press secretary, stressed after the hearing concluded that the president can dismiss an ambassador at any time. “This has been a complete waste of everyone’s time and a disservice to the taxpayers,” she said in a statement.

Yovanovitch and others have described Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, as leading what one called an “irregular channel” outside the diplomatic mainstream of U.S.-Ukraine relations. Giuliani and others had claimed Yovanovitch was not supportive of the president and that she had criticized him to others. Trump, in a conversation with Zelensky, referred to her as “bad news.”

Asked on Friday what she thought of those comments from Trump, she said, “I couldn’t believe it. Shocked appalled. Devastated.” She said recent months had been a ""difficult time"" for her.

Schiff claimed Friday she was ""too tough on corruption for some, and her principled stance made her enemies” and it became clear Trump “wanted her gone.""

Giuliani also blasted Yovanovich during her testimony, noting that he collected information from “a number of witnesses” about her. In a lengthy statement to Fox News, Giuliani accused Yovanovich, and the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, of “being involved in blatant partisan political activities during the 2016 election.”

“The information I obtained was in the nature of evidence form a number of witnesses. All of them, some allies, some opponents, agreed on Ambassador Yovanovich’s wrongdoing,” Giuliani said, adding that the witnesses “could testify among other things that she blocked Ukrainian witnesses who had evidence of illegal interference in 2016 election from getting visas and coming to the U.S.”

Elsewhere in the hearing, tensions between lawmakers boiled over when Schiff repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Nunes accused him of ""gagging"" the lawmaker.

""This is the fifth time you have interrupted a duly-elected member of Congress,"" Stefanik told Schiff, who repeatedly told her she was ""not recognized"" to speak.

The moment began when Nunes yielded the remainder of his allotted time for questions to Stefanik, who had sparred multiple times with Schiff during both days of hearings.

But as Stefanik spoke, Schiff slammed down the gavel: ""The gentlewoman will suspend.""

""What is the interruption for now?"" she shot back.

What followed was a debate between Nunes and Schiff as to whether the Republican could offer his time to a fellow member of Congress, rather than minority counsel. Stefanik repeatedly tried to speak, only for Schiff to bang his gavel again.

""You're gagging the member from New York?"" Nunes laughed at one point.

It was one of a number of clashes over the hearing's procedure. Before the testimony began Friday, Schiff shut down Stefanik for the first time after Stefanik asked if he would “continue to prohibit witnesses from answering Republican questions.” Schiff said it wasn’t a “proper” point of order, and then declined to recognize Jordan, who also tried to raise a parliamentary question.

Questioning under GOP counsel Steve Castor also turned to the issue of alleged Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election – namely reports that former DNC consultant Alexandra Chalupa had meetings during the race with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington to discuss incriminating information about Trump campaign figures.

Yovanovitch said she did not believe she knew Chalupa. Further, when asked if she tried to investigate those interactions, she maintained this would have been handled in the U.S. since the meetings took place in Washington, not in Ukraine. Further, while Ukraine documents eventually were released that were damaging to former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort, Yovanovitch testified that she still doesn’t have information to suggest any effort to target then-candidate Trump.

At its core, the impeachment inquiry concerns Trump’s July call with Zelensky that first came to attention when an anonymous government whistleblower filed a complaint. In the phone conversation, Trump asked for a “favor,” according to an account provided by the White House. He wanted an investigation of Democrats and 2020 rival Joe Biden. Later, it was revealed that the administration was also withholding military aid from Ukraine, which Democrats have alleged was part of a ""quid pro quo"" for the investigations.

Republicans continued to push back on that claim on Friday, arguing that the aid was delivered -- after a delay -- without any such investigation. Stefanik specifically asked Yovanovitch about ""defensive lethal aid"" that she had advocated for.

""That was not provided by President Obama, it was provided by President Trump?"" she asked.

""That's correct,"" Yovanovitch replied.

At the same time the hearing began Friday, the White House released a new transcript of the president’s first call with Zelensky, which showed Trump agreeing to meet with Ukraine’s president-elect -- without preconditions -- in the first official phone call between the two leaders.

PRESIDENT TRUMP AGREES TO MEET UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS, WHITE HOUSE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS

Nunes read the entire letter in his opening statement. A separate call between the two leaders ignited the impeachment inquiry, and Republicans suggested the new transcript is helpful to the president's argument he did nothing wrong in his conversations with Zelensky.

Americans are deeply entrenched in two camps over impeachment, resulting in a mounting political battle that will further test the nation in one of the most polarizing eras of modern times. After the hearing, the Democratic National Committee said that ""in removing Yovanovitch, Trump freed himself to commit a gross abuse of power.""

""The corruption revealed today, corruption that jeopardized our national security and the integrity of our next election, originated from the person sitting in the Oval Office,"" DNC War Room Director Adrienne Watson said.

Pelosi on Thursday brushed aside the Latin phrase “quid pro quo” that Democrats have been using to describe Trump’s actions with a more colloquial one: Bribery.

Trump continued to assail the proceedings as “a hoax” on Thursday, and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., dismissed the witness testimony as hearsay, at best second-hand information.

But as the hearing's ending approached, there were signs of drama to come next week. David Holmes, the Ukraine Embassy staffer who reportedly heard a call between E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Trump that was a highlight of acting Ambassador Bill Taylor's testimony on Wednesday, arrived for a closed-door hearing.

Yovanovitch, meanwhile, received a standing ovation from people in the gallery as she departed the hearing room.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and author Marianne Williamson also failed to qualify.

This month, candidates were required to have reached 3 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls since Sept. 13 or 5 percent in two early-nominating state polls since that date, while collecting contributions from at least 165,000 unique donors -- with at least 600 each in a minimum of 20 states.

CASTRO LAYS OFF STAFF IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA

Some candidates have criticized Perez for what they've viewed as overly stringent requirements. Some argue that the donor emphasis has forced them to spend disproportionately for online fundraising efforts that drain resources they could be using to reach voters in other ways.

Perez says hopefuls have had ample time to demonstrate their supporter, both in polls and through small-dollar contributors, and that any Democrat falling short this far into the campaign almost certainly isn’t positioned to win the nomination or defeat President Trump in November 2020.

Perez has announced even stiffer requirements for a Dec. 19 debate. The polling marks:4 percent in four national polls or 6 percent in two early state polls taken after Oct. 16. The donor threshold: 200,000 unique donors, with at least 800 from each of 20 states.

The top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- are not threatened by those goals. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have met them as well.

But the higher targets put pressure on several other candidates to broaden their support or risk falling out of any reasonable contention with less than three months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.

-- Richard M. Nixon (1913-1994)

As public hearings on impeachment begin, we will see the case for and the case against impeaching President Trump. The facts are largely undisputed, but each side has its version of them.

Democrats will argue that in his July 25, 2019 telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, seen in the context of months of negotiations between American and Ukrainian diplomats, Trump made it known that if the Ukrainian government wanted the $391 million in military and financial aid that Congress authorized and ordered, it first must offer, or announce that it was seeking, dirt on his likely 2020 political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter. That implicates a presidential violation of two federal statutes: One is the prohibition of solicitation of campaign help from a foreign government, and the other is the prohibition of bribery.

Federal election laws prohibit as criminal the mere solicitation of foreign help for a federal political campaign, whether the aid arrives or not. Federal law also prohibits and defines as bribery the intentional withholding or offering to withhold the performance of an official duty until a thing of value arrives, whether the thing of value arrives or not. Solicitation of foreign campaign assistance and bribery are the rare federal crimes that are defined by an attempt or an offer to commit them, even if they are never consummated.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HEARINGS — WHAT REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS CAN EXPECT

All this is magnified, the Democrats will argue, by the immediacy of Ukraine’s financial and military needs. Since 2014, Ukraine has been fighting a bloody war with Russia, resulting in the deaths of 13,000 Ukrainians. In that year, Russia invaded the Ukrainian province of Crimea, which Russia continues to occupy. Since the end of World War II, the stated American policy toward Russia has been to resist and to help allies resist its territorial expansion.

The Democrats will also argue that Trump's orders to executive branch employees to dishonor congressional subpoenas constitute the crime of obstruction of Congress. This is what New York Yankees pitching great Roger Clemens was tried for when he was acquitted of lying to Congress about the contents of his urine. All of these crimes -- solicitation, bribery and obstruction -- are subsumed under the constitutional rubric of high crimes and misdemeanors or bribery. These constitute two of the three permissible bases for impeachment.

None of these crimes requires pressure, coercion or success. Congress considers them so odious to our system that merely offering to commit them constitutes guilt. Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton both were charged with obstruction of Congress by ordering subordinates to refuse to cooperate with congressional investigators -- even though many of them did cooperate.

Republicans will argue that under the Constitution, the president -- not Congress -- sets the foreign policy of the nation. In foreign relations, the Supreme Court has ruled, Congress is limited to declaring war, appropriating funds, ratifying treaties and confirming ambassadors. All else foreign is presidential. Thus, whatever Trump wanted of the Ukrainian government, unless there is proof of evil intent, he was free to ask for. They will argue that there is no evidence of evil intent such as self-dealing or harming an ally or frustrating a congressional purpose.

Republicans will also argue that the impeachment process is irretrievably compromised by the personal involvement, partisan advocacy and secretive methods of the chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. From this, they will argue that Schiff, and the evidence he developed, should be excluded from the proceedings. As well, to House Republicans, the crimes of illegal solicitation, bribery and obstruction of Congress require proof of Trump's guilty state of mind, and such proofs are lacking.

Stated differently, Republicans will contend that because the president was ignorant of federal law and ignorant of his constitutional obligations to spend money as and when Congress directed, he cannot be punished for what he did not know.

This is dangerously close to the Nixonian view of the American presidency -- that the president can do no wrong. Of course, Republicans will not state this plainly, as the lessons of Watergate and Nixon's resignation have soundly and universally repudiated that view.

Finally, Republicans will argue that impeachment cheats democracy. Here they are correct. However, that is not an argument against impeachment. It is an argument against history. James Madison -- the scrivener of the Constitution -- intentionally included anti-democratic features in the Constitution to preserve personal liberty from the tyranny of a congressional majority and the tyranny of presidential ignorance.

The whole purpose of an independent judiciary, for example, is to be anti-democratic -- to preserve the life, liberty and property of the minority from the tyranny of popular laws. And the whole purpose of impeachment is to correct an election after the elected person has demonstrated that he is unfit for office.

The House is operating under rules adopted in 2015, when Republicans ran the House. Schiff is no more secretive about or partisan against the president than my old boss, then-Judiciary chair Rep. Peter Rodino, was toward Nixon or then-Judiciary chair Rep. Henry Hyde was toward Clinton. Both acquired evidence from secret proceedings, and both decided to impeach before any public hearings were held.

Impeachment is political, not juridical. Former President Gerald R. Ford was essentially right when he argued that under the Constitution impeachable offenses are whatever a majority of the House says they are -- for Nixon, covering up a break-in; for Clinton, lying about consensual sex; for Trump, solicitation, bribery and obstruction.

Whose behavior was arguably the gravest?

Desperate Democrats know they have no chance of removing President Trump in a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. But they are determined to use their House majority to impeach him and send their ridiculous case against him to the Senate for a pointless trial for one reason only: to hurt his reelection chances.

This is what the whole disgraceful publicity stunt Democrats are calling an impeachment inquiry is all about – pure politics and nothing else.

DAY ONE OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS PUTS PRESSURE ON MODERATE DEMS

Absurdly, these hearings were sparked by a routine phone call between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

A so-called whistleblower hiding behind a cloak of anonymity started this whole costly and time-wasting nonsensical impeachment process. It will ultimately collapse – but not until Democrats have days of free TV time to level their baseless charges against the duly elected president of the United States.

Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified before the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday in the opening act of this televised impeachment farce.

Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chose to kick-off his exercise in Trump-bashing with the public testimony of Taylor and Kent – despite the fact they were not even on July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call and therefore have no firsthand knowledge of what was discussed.

This is what the whole disgraceful publicity stunt Democrats are calling an impeachment inquiry is all about – pure politics and nothing else

In fact, Schiff’s star witness – Ambassador Taylor – testified that in three meetings with President Zelensky, the issue of “linkage” never came up. This involved a supposed quid pro quo under which Ukraine would only be able to get U.S. foreign aid if it investigated the role of the nation’s previous government in helping Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, along with what appear to be blatantly corrupt activities by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.

The truth is that everything Taylor claims he knows about the facts of the case is based on hearsay. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, was right when he stated at the hearing Wednesday that hearsay very often turns out to be untrue.

Furthermore, Kent testified in his deposition that he’d “never in 27 years been on a call made by a president of the United States” and he had “no knowledge of the specifics of the call record” between Presidents Trump and Zelensky.

One person who was on the call – President Zelensky – has stated repeatedly that there was no pressure from President Trump and nothing inappropriate was discussed on the call.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, deftly questioned Ambassador Taylor about his so-called “clear understanding” of linkage between investigations and U.S. foreign aid.

Jordan rebuffed Taylor’s hearsay-inspired testimony by showing him a sworn declaration from another impeachment witness – U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland – that was about as clear as mud.

The Sondland declaration stated in part that “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I had conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky.”

Jordan described the perplexing statement in epic fashion: “We got six people taking about four conversations in one sentence and you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding?”

This exchange led by the highly effective Jordan was the highlight of Wednesday’s questioning. The fact that Democrats are relying on indecipherable testimony such as this is exactly why their case is collapsing.

Democratic impeachment addicts in the House have a fundamental problem that is insurmountable. There was no quid pro quo with Ukraine; there was no abuse of power and there was no “extortion scheme” because Ukraine received the U.S. foreign aid without initiating any investigation.

The big takeaway from the opening impeachment hearing is that Schiff – the ringleader of the Democrat coup attempt against President Trump – has a Clinton problem. He’s a liar who suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Schiff will never build public support for his pathetic impeachment theory with the American people because he has no credibility and no evidence.

First off, at the Wednesday hearing Schiff obviously lied when he said he doesn’t know the identity of the whistleblower. It strains credulity that Schiff’s staff didn’t tell him the identity of the whistleblower once they were in contact with him.

Not to mention, some news organizations and social media have identified a person they claim to be the whistleblower for weeks. The idea that Schiff is oblivious to all of this is not possible.

Secondly, Schiff lied about President Trump’s call with Zelensky during an earlier congressional proceeding. The Democratic congressman falsified the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call at a public hearing for political purposes. Schiff doctored what was said on the call because the call itself was routine and undramatic.

Next, Schiff lied about his staff’s contact with the anonymous whistleblower. Why did he lie? Because Schiff doesn’t want the whistleblower’s complaint to appear concocted or politically inspired.

As it turns out, Schiff’s staff was in contact with the whistleblower in the lead-up to the complaint being filed because this entire circus is an orchestrated conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2016 election and nullify the votes of 63 million Americans who cast ballots for Donald Trump.

Schiff’s staff is made up of partisan Democrats and the whistleblower is also reportedly a partisan Democrat.

After that, Schiff lied about allowing the whistleblower to testify. At some point Schiff came to the conclusion that the whistleblower’s alleged political bias is too big a risk and his testimony to the committee would destroy the already flimsy case the Democrats have put together.

In light of this suspicious change in direction, shouldn’t Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson answer questions about why he disregarded the whistleblower’s reported political bias and pushed ahead with sending the complaint to Congress as a matter of urgent concern?

The American people have a right to know why Schiff no longer thinks the whistleblower’s testimony is important, even though Atkinson believed the information he possessed was of urgent concern.

Schiff also lied about conducting the impeachment inquiry in a fair and impartial manner. If Schiff was interested in fairness in his crazed pursuit to impeach President Trump for trying to root out Biden-related corruption in Ukraine, why won’t he allow Republicans to call the former vice president and his son to testify about what they were doing in Ukraine?

If Schiff was interested in the truth, obtaining these facts would be an essential part of the record. Schiff’s refusal to allow this testimony smacks of politics and further damages his credibility and greatly damages his case.

As the leader of the coup attempt against President Trump, Schiff is incapable of telling the truth and has no credibility. Every American should keep that in mind when this witch hunt reconvenes on Friday with Schiff again running the show.

That may have been the easy part.

On Friday morning at 9 a.m. ET, the 60-year-old diplomat will take the stand again for Day Two of the public impeachment hearings against President Trump -- and Republicans are set to hammer her with an aggressive cross-examination related to her previous statements under oath, as well as her reported role in shielding a George Soros-linked nonprofit allegedly connected to documented Ukrainian election interference efforts.

“The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news,” was how Trump described Yovanovitch to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call.

“She’s going to go through some things,” the president added ominously.

“The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news. She’s going to go through some things.” — President Trump

Shortly before Yovanovitch was set to take the stand, Fox News contributor John Solomon published an explosive March interview with Yuriy Lutsenko, a former prosecutor general in Ukraine. Lutsenko claimed that Yovanovitch had given him a “do not prosecute” list — and Solomon reported that Yovanovitch pressured Ukrainian prosecutors to back off a case involving the AntiCorruption Action Centre, funded by Soros, the liberal megadonor.

The U.S. Embassy under Yovanovitch, Solomon reported, also influenced Ukraine to drop prosecution against top law enforcement official Artem Sytnyk, who was singled out by a Ukrainian court for leaking damaging information about Paul Manafort, then Trump's campaign chairman, to help Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Ukraine courts have ruled that the Manafort financial disclosures constituted illegal election meddling.

Ukraine systematically worked behind the scenes to boost Clinton, Politico has reported. On his call with Zelensky in July, Trump specifically asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate reports that Ukraine had some involvement in 2016 election interference, before he mentioned taking a look at Joe Biden's business dealings in the country.

Though multiple reports, including one from The Associated Press, indicated Lutsenko had recanted his claims about Yovanovitch, Lutsenko said he had not -- a revelation later confirmed by The New York Times.

On Friday and beyond, House Republicans plan to sharpen their focus on allegations of Ukraine meddling in the 2016 presidential election, voicing frustration after top diplomats who testified Wednesday said they had no knowledge of the issue. A senior Republican official told Fox News on Thursday that the issue of Ukrainian election meddling would be a “theme” of questions asked by GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee moving forward.

UKRAINE MEDDLING TO BE KEY GOP FOCUS MOVING FORWARD, AFTER WITNESSES APPEARED NOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT

Making matters more complicated for Democrats, Yovanovitch's testimony was set to come just hours after a bombshell report that a top Ukrainian official said Thursday that U.S. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a key Democrat impeachment witness, ""did not link financial military assistance to a request for Ukraine to open up an investigation into former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.""

Citing that report in a tweet late Thursday, Trump called the impeachment probe ""dead.""

Sondland has testified that Trump explicitly told him there were ""no quid pro quos of any kind"" with Ukraine, including one in which military aid would be conditioned on any politically motivated investigations. (Sondland later amended his testimony, claiming his recollection had been ""refreshed,"" to say he had come to ""understand"" from other sources that Trump wanted Ukraine to issue an ""anti-corruption statement."")

Forced out of her job in April, Yovanovitch likely can't offer much of substance on her own about the central allegations against the president. Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry contend that several months later in the year, Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, and withheld U.S. military aid as leverage.

The timeline will render Yovanovitch vulnerable to the same criticisms that Republicans had for William Taylor and George Kent, the two diplomats who testified during Day One of the impeachment proceedings: That all she can offer is unverifiable hearsay and speculation.

WATCH: JIM JORDAN UNLOADS ON 'HEARSAY' TESTIMONY DURING DAY ONE OF IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Additionally, Republican lawmakers have argued that Yovanovitch wasn't entirely truthful in her previous remarks under oath. She communicated via her personal email account with a Democratic congressional staffer concerning a ""quite delicate"" and ""time-sensitive"" matter -- just two days after the whistleblower complaint that kickstarted the impeachment inquiry was filed, and a month before the complaint became public, emails exclusively obtained by Fox News showed.

The emails appear to contradict Yovanovitch's deposition on Capitol Hill last month, in which she told U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., about an email she received Aug. 14 from the staffer, Laura Carey -- but indicated under oath that she never responded to it.

""I specifically asked her whether the Democratic staffer was responded to by Yovanovitch or the State Department,"" Zeldin told Fox News. ""It is greatly concerning that Ambassador Yovanovitch didn't answer my question as honestly as she should have, especially while under oath.""

Yovanovitch's colleagues, for their part, have said she was the target of a smear campaign by the White House, and Trump himself has called the diplomat ""bad news.""

Separately during her remarks, Yovanovitch outlined how she lost her job in Ukraine, even as she remains an employee of the State Department.

“You’re going to think that I’m incredibly naive,” Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators. “But I couldn’t imagine all the things that have happened over the last six or seven months. I just couldn’t imagine it.”

EMAILS OBTAINED BY FOX NEWS SHOW KEY DEM IMPEACHMENT WITNESS WASN'T HONEST UNDER OATH, GOP SEN SAYS

Democratic lawmakers are expected to point to the circumstances of her ouster as they try to make their case that Trump, with the help of his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, mounted an inappropriate pressure campaign to enlist Zelensky in the effort to damage Biden.

“Giuliani also conducted a smear campaign against the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said at the first public impeachment hearing earlier this week. “A senior State Department official told her that although she had done nothing wrong, President Trump had lost confidence in her.”

Trump was convinced Yovanovitch was a rogue actor who held a political bias against him, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 call between the president and Zelensky.

At the time of the call, the Trump administration had put a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and Zelensky and his team were trying to get Trump to commit to a date for a White House meeting.

The intelligence community whistleblower who spurred the House investigation cited Yovanovitch’s ouster as one in a series of events that amounted to an abuse of power by the president.

'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY SAID IN 2017, VOWING IMPEACHMENT

Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday accused the president of ""bribery"" by allegedly ""threatening to withhold military aid"" in exchange for an ""investigation into his political rival"" -- signaling that Democrats were preparing to go all-in on impeachment. The Washington Post had reported Democrats were retiring the ""quid pro quo"" language in exchange for ""bribery"" following an internal study showing the word ""bribery"" resonated more in battleground states.

Yovanovitch, a State Department employee for 33 years who also led U.S. embassies in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, is well known in diplomatic circles for her measured demeanor and diligence in representing both Republican and Democratic administrations, according to former colleagues.

“Mr. Giuliani was almost unmissable starting in mid-March,” Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Wednesday. “As the news campaign, or campaign of slander, against not only Ambassador Yovanovitch unfolded ... he was on TV, his Twitter feed ramped up and it was all focused on Ukraine.”

After the ambassador’s recall, Giuliani told Ukrainian journalists that Yovanovitch was pulled from Kiev because she was part of efforts against the president. The former New York City mayor also has said that he told the president there were concerns among Trump supporters that she had displayed anti-Trump bias in private conversations.

During her October testimony, Yovanovitch said she was told that the State Department had been under pressure from Trump to remove her from Ukraine since the summer of 2018.

FLASHBACK: TRUMP'S NOT ALONE: CONGRESS DIGGING INTO DNC-UKRAINE CONNECTION

In late March, the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., posted a tweet referring to her as a “joker,” and linked to an article from the conservative website Daily Wire that detailed a growing call for Yovanovitch’s ouster.

Yovanovitch raised concerns about the U.S. media reports with Sondland. In response, Sondland encouraged her to tweet her support for Trump on social media.

“He said, ‘You know, you need to go big or go home,'” she recalled. “‘You need to, you know, tweet out there that you support the president.’”

The advice allegedly floored Yovanovitch.

BILL CLINTON OFFERS TRUMP SOME IMPEACHMENT ADVICE

“I just didn't see that there would be any advantage to publicly taking on a fight with those who were criticizing me in the United States.” — Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine

Now Yovanovitch, hardly a marquee name in Washington, finds herself thrust into the spotlight of just the fourth impeachment inquiry in U.S. history.

Nancy McEldowney, a former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria who has known Yovanovitch for three decades, said the accusations levied by Trump and Giuliani don’t square with the professional envoy whose focus throughout her career has remained on “serving American national interests and supporting the people around her.”

Some GOP senators have talked about contingency plans should the House impeach the president. Specifically, Republicans have floated the idea of holding a lengthy Senate trial early next year, which would potentially jam up several Democratic presidential contenders in the middle of the primary season.

House Democrats, however, could preempt that strategy -- perhaps by approving an article of impeachment, then waiting to approve a second resolution formally notifying the Senate of the impeachment until after the primary season is over.

In back-to-back press conferences, Pelosi and McCarthy delivered starkly contrasting accounts of the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, with both claiming their respective parties were fighting to protect the U.S. Constitution.

GOP REPS TO ZERO IN ON UKRAINE MEDDLING CLAIMS, AFTER DIPLOMATS STUMPED AT HEARING

“Democrats are showing great patriotism,” Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday, praising Schiff, D-Calif., for his “dignity and statesmanship.” “This isn’t about politics or anything political, it’s about patriotism, it’s about honoring our oath of office, and upholding the Constitution.”

She added: “This is something we do with a heavy heart. This is very prayerful, because impeachment is a divisive thing in our country.”

Pelosi went on to accuse the president of “bribery,” citing Wednesday’s public hearing featuring what she called “devastating” witness testimony from State Department official George Kent and U.S. top diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.

“Bribery—and that is in the Constitution and attached to impeachment proceedings,” Pelosi said. “The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the election—that’s bribery.”

When asked whether bribery would be included as an article of impeachment, Pelosi replied: “We haven’t even made a decision to impeach. That’s what the inquiry is about.”

“I’m saying, [what] the president has admitted to as ‘perfect,’ is bribery,” Pelosi said.

Minutes later, McCarthy, R-Calif., took the podium on the other side of the House, claiming it’s Republicans who are “standing up” for the Constitution.

“Are they doing this for political purposes or are they standing for the Constitution?” McCarthy said. “They came to Congress to impeach the president.”

McCarthy went on to blast Schiff, claiming he “has continued to lie to the American public.”

McCarthy outlined several instances where he believed Schiff had lied—including during the congressional Russia probe and when he “on purpose” delivered a parody reading last month of the transcript of Trump’s now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.

That phone call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the Intelligence Community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

On the call, Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into Ukrainian election meddling in the 2016 presidential race and into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

Zelensky, though, has said he felt no pressure during the call. The White House has maintained no wrongdoing, and the president has repeatedly said the call was “perfect,” arguing that it contained “no quid pro quo.”

McCarthy also said that Schiff “lied again” when he claimed during the public hearing on Wednesday that he “didn’t know who the whistleblower was.”

“His staff met with the whistleblower, he can claim he did not. They met with the whistleblower before the whistleblower had an attorney and before the whistleblower went to the inspector general,” McCarthy explained. “When he went, you know that the whistleblower did not say that he met with Schiff’s staff.”

Fox News reported last month that the whistleblower did not disclose contact with Schiff’s staff to the intelligence committee inspector general (ICIG).

Schiff’s office acknowledged that the whistleblower had reached out to them before filing a complaint in mid-August, giving Democrats advance warning of the accusations that would lead them to launch an impeachment inquiry days later.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN RAISES $3.3 MILLION ON FIRST DAY OF IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

During his attack of Schiff, McCarthy said he does “not think that Schiff is fit to be in the position to run the Intelligence Committee.”

“And yes, I do believe Schiff has spent his entire time in Congress, since the president has been in, trying to impeach him,” McCarthy said. “He’s already written the script and he’s trying to fill it in—he’s been auditioning witnesses in the basement.”

Meanwhile, up next on Friday in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry is former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich, with a number of other hearings with current and former top officials scheduled for next week."

""The rules of impeachment are very clear. We’ll have to have a trial,"" announced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, conceding that the Senate must hold a trial to determine whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office if the Democrat-led House votes to impeach.

What that means for Democratic senators who are also running for president is that they may be forced off the campaign trail to return to Washington D.C. in the critical runup to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries in February 2020.

""That raises a question - who is a trial going to benefit?"" asked Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly [Senate] Republicans are not going to convict the president and yet you're going to have at least six Senate Democratic senators who are running for their nomination, sitting in Washington all through January, enduring this trial.""

""You've got the Iowa [caucuses] coming up the first week of August, followed by New Hampshire, followed by the Nevada caucuses, and then a caucus, a primary in South Carolina,"" he continued. ""In effect, this process of impeachment is suppressing the Democratic message, other than the fact that the message for three years is that they have been chasing the president of the United States.""

In fact, the conundrum for some Democrats is reportedly not lost on the candidates themselves.

The Washington Post reported that ""advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes."" In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., told the Post that a Senate trial would present a serious challenge. “We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to. But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult,” he said.

""So who does [a Senate trial] benefit? Short answer, Pete Buttigieg,"" said Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kyle Peterson. ""He's going to be the only guy in Des Moines. He's going to be walking around, shaking hands, kissing babies and the other Democrats... they're gonna be stuck in Washington, not saying much.""

2020 Democratic national frontrunner Joe Biden will also be free to remain on the campaign trail if the Senate holds a trial. However, recent polling has shown him falling behind his competitors in the early Democratic primary states.

IS IT TOO LATE FOR MORE DEMOCRATS TO JUMP INTO THE 2020 RACE?

""I totally agree,"" said Judith Miller, Fox News contributor and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter. ""It also benefits Mike Bloomberg and the governor of Massachusetts [Deval Patrick], who's now throwing his hat into the ring, maybe.""

Miller concluded by saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., must have foreseen these circumstances.

""I think that was another reason that so troubled Pelosi [by the prospect of impeachment]. She understands the calendar better than anybody - along with votes. And she knew that this was exactly the prospect,"" Miller said. ""If I were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the other Democratic senators who are going to be confined to Washington in this trial, I would be very worried indeed.""

So in the spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.’ Patrick is expected to travel later on Thursday to neighboring New Hampshire to file for the state’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary.

Biden proposes $1.3 trillion infrastructure plan - Politico: “Joe Biden wants to spend $1.3 trillion on infrastructure as president, aiming to reduce carbon emissions, create jobs and shore up the ailing Highway Trust Fund with ‘new revenues’ in a plan released Thursday that's reminiscent of the Obama years. Biden’s 12-page plan promises to ‘ensure new revenues are secured to stabilize the Highway Trust Fund’ but doesn’t specify where those revenues would come from or how he would get political consensus for them. In many ways it's also a throwback to the administration of President Barack Obama, with planks related to ‘complete streets,’ repairing existing infrastructure before building new and calling for investments in transit and high-speed rail. The plan’s goal of working directly with cities, instead of always going through state departments of transportation as an intermediary, is another throwback.”



Pragmatic Klobuchar gaining ground - Time: “While Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proffered revolutionary proposals—including free college tuition, nationwide student-debt cancellation and Medicare for All—[Amy] Klobuchar has staked out a platform defined by pragmatism. Her higher-education plan centers on free in-state community college and higher Pell Grant caps, and her health care proposal offers a public option through which people could purchase access to Medicare or Medicaid. …Klobuchar has seized the opportunity to brand herself as the moderate alternative—a take-your-vitamins realist in a field defined by idealism. There’s some evidence her strategy is working. In the six days after the October debate … Klobuchar’s campaign raked in $2.1 million… She has since become one of 10 candidates to qualify for the November debate in Atlanta, and one of six to qualify for the December one in Los Angeles. Her support in the Hawkeye State has swelled too.”



Post heart attack Sanders trying to rebound - NYT: “Before a campaign event last month, Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, went for an hourlong stroll around Green Castle Recreation Area, a lush park in central Iowa with evergreen trees and a small lake. … Ms. Sanders is ensuring that her husband is getting adequate rest, and he has been requesting fish for dinner instead of steak or ribs. … Some allies, aware that Mr. Sanders can appear rumpled, have even urged him to dress better — he has been wearing more stylish sweaters — and to rein in his previously unkempt hair. … His recuperative program has coincided with a vigorous push to reboot his campaign… He and his team recognize that his ability to beat his chief ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren, and the rest of the leading candidates depends in part on whether he can convince voters that his age, and his health, is not an issue.”



Warren attacks billionaires in new campaign ad - CNBC: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is launching a new attack on the billionaires who have criticized her proposed taxes and policies with a new ad set to air on CNBC this week, according to a campaign aide. Titled ‘Elizabeth Warren Stands Up to Billionaires,’ the ad takes aim at longtime investor Leon Cooperman, former CEO of TD Ameritrade Joe Ricketts, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. The ad will premiere Thursday on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street,’ which airs at 9 a.m. ET, and Jim Cramer’s ‘Mad Money,’ which airs at 6 p.m. ET, in all New York and Washington, D.C., markets, the aide added. The ad will be part of a digital buy, as well. … The ad opens with Warren telling a campaign rally: ‘It is time for a wealth tax.’ The ad then plays clips of the aforementioned billionaires.”



THE RULEBOOK: THE HOUSE REPRESENTS

“Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 52



TIME OUT: ‘CALL ME ISHMAEL.’

History: “Moby-Dick is now considered a great classic of American literature… Initially, though, the book about Captain Ahab and his quest to catch a giant white whale was a flop. Its author, Herman Melville was born in New York City in 1819. … Melville’s sixth book, Moby-Dick, was first published in October 1851 in London, in three volumes titled The Whale, and then in the U.S. a month later [on Nov. 14, 1851]. Melville had promised his publisher an adventure story similar to his popular earlier works, but instead, Moby-Dick was a tragic epic, influenced in part by Melville’s friend and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, neighbor, Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose novels include The Scarlet Letter. … Melville died in 1891, largely forgotten by the literary world. By the 1920s, scholars had rediscovered his work, particularly Moby-Dick, which would eventually become a staple of high school reading lists across the United States.”

FIRST DAY OF HEARINGS PUTS PRESSURE ON MODERATE DEMS

Fox News: “All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night, after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats' key witnesses, who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president. At one point in Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., even appeared to embrace hearsay testimony, claiming that ‘hearsay can be much better evidence than direct’ … It was unclear which of those limited exceptions would apply to Wednesday's testimony -- and whether Quigley's argument would persuade critical swing-vote Democrats. … Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence. ‘My constituents expect me to make an objective decision,’ Slotkin said as the hearings concluded…”



Pelosi says Trump committed bribery - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that President Donald Trump committed ‘bribery,’ an impeachable offense, by trying to force Ukraine into tarnishing a political rival to help him in the 2020 election. The speaker’s remark is one of her strongest statements yet on the scandal engulfing Trump that is threatening his presidency. Bribery is one of the specific crimes spelled out in the Constitution as an impeachable offense. ‘I am saying what the president has admitted to and said it’s perfect — it’s perfectly wrong. It’s bribery,’ Pelosi told reporters during her weekly press conference Thursday. … Still, Pelosi cautioned, she isn’t yet ready to say whether the House will vote to impeach Trump, an outcome many lawmakers think is all but certain to happen by the end of this year.”



Report: Republicans discuss prolonging Senate impeachment trial - WaPo: “Some Republican senators and their advisers are privately discussing whether to pressure GOP leaders to stage a lengthy impeachment trial beginning in January to scramble the Democratic presidential race — potentially keeping six contenders in Washington until the eve of the Iowa caucuses or longer. Those conversations about the timing and framework for a trial remain fluid and closely held, according to more than a dozen participants in the discussions. But the deliberations come as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) faces pressure from conservative activists to swat back at Democrats as public impeachment hearings began this week in the House. The discussions raise a potential hazard for the six Democratic senators running for president, who had previously planned on a final sprint out of Washington before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.”



Did anything new come from the hearings? - Fox News: “[Wednesday] offered one previously undisclosed allegation. Career diplomat William Taylor, the charge d’affaires in Kiev, offered testimony, for the first time that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about ‘the investigations,’ to which Sondland supposedly responded that ‘the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.’ Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine. ‘Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,’ Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. ‘At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.’”



What’s next - AP: “Several more witnesses scheduled to testify in the House impeachment hearings over the next week are expected to say they too worried about President Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to investigate Democrats as the U.S. withheld military aid from the country. … On Friday, lawmakers will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in May at Trump’s direction. … Eight more witnesses will testify next week, some in back-to-back hearings on the same day. Among them will be Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council … Gordon Sondland, Trump’s European Union ambassador … and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House who told lawmakers about national security adviser John Bolton’s concerns about Ukraine. … The public hearings are expected to last at least another week.”



White House brings in backup to unify strategy - WashEx: “Newly appointed White House aide Tony Sayegh will try to bring cohesion to a disorderly White House impeachment response… The Washington Examiner has learned that Sayegh, a former Treasury official, will work with the White House communications team, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his staff, and other administration offices to develop and streamline a strategy to dispute allegations and make sure Republicans are on the same page. … Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi was brought in to partner with Sayegh and will be the media face of the anti-impeachment campaign, with plans to leverage her legal background to discredit allegations by House Democrats that the president abused his power in his dealings with Ukraine.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Impeachment and the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses the facts surrounding the impeachment hearings: “The House is operating under rules adopted in 2015, when Republicans ran the House. Schiff is no more secretive about or partisan against the president than my old boss, then-Judiciary chair Rep. Peter Rodino, was toward Nixon or then-Judiciary chair Rep. Henry Hyde was toward Clinton. Both acquired evidence from secret proceedings, and both decided to impeach before any public hearings were held. Impeachment is political, not juridical. Former President Gerald R. Ford was essentially right when he argued that under the Constitution impeachable offenses are whatever a majority of the House says they are -- for Nixon, covering up a break-in; for Clinton, lying about consensual sex; for Trump, solicitation, bribery and obstruction. Whose behavior was arguably the gravest?” More here.



JON HUNTSMAN ANNOUNCES THIRD RUN FOR UTAH GOVERNOR

The Salt Lake Tribune: “Former U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman says he’s grown weary of the national political scene, with its ‘theatrics,’ time-wasting and dearth of meaningful action. Now, he’s asking Utah’s voters to return him to what he calls ‘the best job in the world’ — working as governor. ‘For a very long time, we’ve served our country in the top two diplomatic posts in the world. Now we feel it is time to give back to our home state again,’ Huntsman said on a campaign video posted Thursday morning. He’s vying for a third term as governor in the 2020 election, a little more than 10 years since he last held the post. He previously served as governor from 2005 to 2009. … News leaked Wednesday night that Huntsman would be kicking off his campaign Thursday, and he did with an early call-in to KSL radio and by launching his website and campaign materials.”



RNC jumps in to help Louisiana governor’s race - Politico: “The Republican National Committee is pouring another $1 million into the Louisiana governor’s race ahead of Saturday’s runoff — a move that comes amid mounting GOP concerns about losing a second major election in a conservative state in as many weeks. The last-minute spending doubles the committee’s investment in the race, where Republican Eddie Rispone is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. President Donald Trump is set to headline a rally for Rispone in Louisiana on Thursday evening, barreling ahead despite worries within the GOP that Edwards is a slight favorite to win. Trump had bet that a GOP sweep in three gubernatorial races this fall would project political strength in the face of impeachment. But after Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent defeat in Kentucky last week, and with Rispone locked in a neck-and-neck race, the president is facing the possibility of losing two out of three.”

GOOD PIGGIES

NY Post: “These pigs have a nose for nose candy. Italy’s Il Tirreno reported that authorities believe wild boars in Tuscany have sniffed out some 20,000 euros (about $22,000) worth of cocaine buried in the woods near Montepulciano. Local police learned of the incident after tapping the phone lines of a suspected drug-trafficking group, who revealed the incident during one of their calls. The powder had been stored in jars and tucked into waterproof packages. Allegedly, a boar had stomped the earth where the jars had been buried, which caused the containers to burst, scattering the illicit stimulant across the forest floor. Local officials claim this particular gang is responsible for slinging some two kilograms of blow per month to club-goers around the cities of Arezzo and Siena between September 2018 and March 2019… The drug dealers — one Italian and three Albanians — have been arrested and face charges for drug trafficking.”

With so many questions unanswered, one above all will matter: Will Democrats be able to convince a divided country that President Trump is unworthy of his office and must be impeached?

Of course, that question couldn’t be answered in full just from Day One of the hearings before the House Intelligence Committee. Nevertheless, the pressure was on the Democrats to at least begin producing some of the “goods” on Trump or risk losing the interest of the American people and their support for an impeachment inquiry – let alone their potential support for an impeachment vote.

RNC CHAIR MCDANIEL: AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING, DEMOCRATS PURSUE DELUDED DREAM TO OVERTURN TRUMP’S ELECTION

With that in mind, what was the significance of Day One of the proceedings? Here are the Top 5 takeaways.

There is no bipartisanship among the inquirers

In 1973, Republican Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee was the ranking member of the Senate Watergate Committee. Two years before, President Richard Nixon asked Baker if he wanted to be on the Supreme Court. Despite his alliance with Nixon, during the Watergate hearings, Baker famously asked: “What did the president know and when did he know it?” Despite the enormity of the moment, or because of it, Baker led the way in a bipartisan investigation.

Decades later, it is apparent that none of that bipartisanship exists on the House Intelligence Committee, chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Schiff is certainly no Howard Baker. As of this moment, the two parties are across the proverbial aisle from each other. At the hearing Wednesday, the Democrats pressed their selected opinions and facts and the Republicans pressed theirs. It was “us against them” – with no meeting of the minds. That is likely to continue because . . .

There are a limited number of facts in dispute and few revelations expected

The Watergate hearings, which took place before 24-hour cable news and social media, seemed breathless at the time as revelations unfolded. The impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton occurred while the Internet was still young, involved many aspects, was salacious at times and involved many characters.

By contrast, Day One of the Trump impeachment hearing produced no blockbuster moments – new details yes, but no grand surprise. Why? Two reasons. First, it appears that most of the significant facts are already out in the open through leaks and the release of deposition transcripts. This day might have mattered more if the Democrats had held back their release of information.

Overall, the Republicans were not surprised by Wednesday’s proceedings and Democrats had the day scripted – if not overly scripted. If that holds true for the balance of the proceedings, the Republicans will justifiably maintain their view that nothing impeachable occurred, and the Democrats could be seen as still not delivering the goods.

Beyond that, the public likely will get bored hearing opinion after opinion about the same set of facts. That is a bad omen for the Democrats.

The Democrats case has been reduced to arguing about intent

The Democrats came charging into the day talking about bribery and extortion. However, Day One established that Ukraine got the aid it wanted from President Trump – a lot more than the Democrats and President Obama delivered to the nation.

Ukraine got the aid without having to do anything – no added investigation, no added statement, no nothing. That leaves the Democrats arguing that Trump “intended” to be bad toward Ukraine.

That is a tough sell because, as Day One proved, when President Obama was asked for military aid by Ukraine, he sent blankets because he did not want to antagonize Russia. It also produced this headline in Europe: “Poroshenko asks Obama for weapons, obtains blankets.”

Keep in mind that Obama refused that military aid after attempting to secretly tell Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have “more flexibility” after the next election. Is that not evidence of Obama asking for Russia to not jeopardize his reelection by its actions and words?

Given that, as Day One closed, Americans might rightfully ask: Who was better for Ukraine?

Ukraine was a swamp that enveloped the Bidens and is worthy of investigation

If you didn’t know before that Ukraine had a history of political corruption, it was not possible to watch Day One and not know it now.

That history lesson hurts the Democrats because, as Fox News reported: “State Department official George Kent testified Wednesday that he would ‘love’ to see Ukraine look into the circumstances surrounding the closure of a probe tied to natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, while also raising concerns that Hunter Biden’s role on the board of that firm created the appearance of a conflict of interest.”

Given the Democrats stated refusal to allow an inquiry in these proceedings into the actions of the former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Kent’s statement bolsters the Republican cause for looking into the Bidens and muddies the waters for the Democrats.

Democrats would like to portray themselves as the folks wearing the white hats in these proceedings. If Republicans successfully counter with the actions of the Bidens and the request for dirt on former Trump campaign head Paul Manafort by the Obama administration and the Democratic National Committee, the air could quickly come out of their impeachment balloon.

Few minds were changed

Impeachment is a political process, not a legal process. The Democrats are trying to win a political battle. Were any Republicans' minds changed? Likely not many across the country. How about Democrats? Also, likely nor many in our divided times.

Were the minds of many independents changed? Only time will tell, but this much is true: On balance, this was not a big day for Democrats. Yes, they told the story they wanted to tell. But any reasonable person will see that this is a one-sided affair and that President Trump delivered the military goods to Ukraine to fight Russia.

Day One – when the Democrats had the nation’s attention – did not deliver the political goods the Democrats need to persuade Americans to favor Trump’s impeachment.

The three House committees overseeing the impeachment inquiry against Trump released hundreds of pages of closed-door testimony by Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to Pence on Europe and Russia, and Tim Morrison, the former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council. Morrison was interviewed Oct. 31 and Williams was interviewed Nov. 7.

Both Williams and Morrison were listening in on the July 25 phone call, which was flagged by an intelligence community whistleblower and has become the center of the impeachment inquiry. House Democrats say that aid was withheld from Ukraine until its government launched investigations into Biden, his son Hunter and their dealings in the eastern European county -- particularly the younger Biden's work with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.

Investigators also met Saturday with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official Mark Sandy, who was involved in key meetings about the nearly $400 million aid package Congress had approved for Ukraine.

Williams told lawmakers that the word ""Burisma"" appeared in her notes of the July 25 call, though it did not appear in the memorandum of the conversation released by the White House in September. The transcript indicates that Williams initially told lawmakers that Trump mentioned Burisma to Zelensky, but a letter from her attorney following the deposition states that Williams' ""recollection had been incorrect"" and Zelensky mentioned Burisma to Trump.

For his part, Morrison that he consulted NSC lawyers following the July 25 call because he was worried about details of the conversation being leaked to the media, according to transcripts of his testimony released Saturday.

In his testimony, Morrison said he asked NSC Legal Adviser John Eisenberg and Eisenberg's deputy, Michael Ellis, to review the July 25 call ""because I was concerned about whether or not they would agree that it would be damaging ... if the call package, if the call mem-con [memorandum of conversation] or its contents leaked.""

During the call itself, Morrison said he was concerned by how ""obsequious"" Zelensky sounded toward Trump and added that the conversation ""was not the full-throated endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda that I was hoping to hear.""

Morrison added that he and Eisenberg agreed that access to the call should be restricted, but then claimed Eisbenberg later told him that he did not intend for the call summary to be placed on a highly classified server. According to Morrison, Eisenberg's staff apparently put it there by mistake and nothing in the call's contents warranted placement on the classified server.

Morrison also told House investigators that Fiona Hill, a top NSC expert on Russia, had described U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland ""as a problem"" who ""believed he had the mandate to get involved [in Ukraine policy] based on his relationship with"" Trump, even though Ukraine is not a member of the EU.

""We [Morrison and Hill] both discussed that Ukraine was not in the EU, which led to the follow-on question of, why is he involved in Ukraine?"" said Morrison of Sondland, who is expected to testify publicly on Wednesday. Morrison, who is set to publicly testify Tuesday, added that he became concerned while listening to the July 25 phone call that Hill's fear that Sondland was involved in a ""parallel process"" of making Ukraine policy was true.

Weeks after the July 25 call, on Sept. 1, Sondland held a conversation with a top Zelensky aide, Andriy Yermak, on the sidelines of a summit between Pence and Zelensky in Warsaw.

Morrison said he witnessed the exchange and that afterward Sondland bounded across the room to tell him what was said. Sondland told him that ""what could help them move the aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation,"" Morrison testified.

""My concern was what Gordon was proposing about getting the Ukrainians pulled into our politics,"" Morrison said. He added: ""It was the first time something like this had been injected as a condition on the release of the assistance.""

A few days later, on Sept. 7, Morrison told investigators that Sondland ""related that both -- the president [Trump] said there was not a quid pro quo, but he [Trump] further stated that President Zelensky should want to go to the microphone and announce personally -- so it wouldn't be enough fon the prosecutor general, he wanted to announce personally, Zelensky personally, that he would open the investigations.""

While some, including Trump himself, have begun to question Sondland's knowledge of events, Morrison said the ambassador ""related to me he was acting -- he was discussing these matters with the President.""

As Sondland, Giuliani and others tried to persuade Zelensky to launch the investigations Trump wanted of his Democratic rivals, Morrison said he ""tried to stay away.""

""The testimony released today shows that President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky immediately set off alarm bells throughout the White House,"" Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Oversight Committee Acting Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel said in a joint statement. ""Both witnesses provided the Committees with first-hand accounts after personally listening to the call in the White House Situation Room ... We look forward to the public testimony of both officials.""

A senior administration official, meanwhile, lashed out at House Democrats in response to reports that they had changed their terminology to describe the allegations against Trump in response to polling data.

""The only reaction coming from House Democrats, who continue to use PR firms and DCCC polling data to push their conspiracy theories as facts, seems to be that of disappointment. Everything so far is about the temperature of the room, and that the testimony was 'technical' and didn’t get them what they wanted,"" the official said. ""It’s looking like Democrats are now desperate to sell any narrative that’ll justify what most Americans recognize has been an extreme abuse of Congress’ powers. At this point, their fishing expedition would probably even find George Washington guilty of treason.""

On Friday, a new voice took a swipe at Biden. Officials in North Korea called him a “rabid dog” that “must be beaten to death with a stick,” according to the Associated Press. It was the latest blow the rogue country has targeted against foreign leaders it views as hostile to the rule of Kim Jong Un.



TIM RYAN ENDORSES BIDEN DESPITE PAST CAMPAIGN TRAIL CRITICISM



The commentary by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said Biden ""reeled off a string of rubbish against the dignity"" of the North's supreme leadership, an act it said deserves ""merciless punishment.""



The editorial referred to Biden (or sometimes ""Baiden"") using only his surname and as the man who served as vice president under Barack Obama.



Back in May, however, the North correctly spelled Biden's name when it labeled him a ""fool of low IQ"" after he called Kim a tyrant during a speech.



The reclusive country often insulted foreign leaders and politicians when it sees what it considers slanderous remarks aimed at its leaders or hostile policies against its government. In addition, the North has made racist or sexist diatribes against Obama and former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, the country's first female leader.



The North reversed this policy concerning President Trump, however, when the nation’s 45th president made diplomatic overtures to Kim in 2018, resulting in three summits. Prior to the overtures, the North Koreans referred to Trump as a “dotard.”



NORTH KOREA WARNS OF ‘BIGGER THREAT AND HARSH SUFFERING’ OVER NUCLEAR TALKS DEADLINE



""Anyone who dare slanders the dignity of the supreme leadership of the D.P.R.K, can never spare the D.P.R.K's merciless punishment whoever and wherever,"" said the North Korean statement, referring to the country by its formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.



""Rabid dogs like Baiden [sic] can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about,” the statement continued. “They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late,"" it said.

It wasn't immediately clear which of Biden's comments provoked North Korea's anger. He’s accused Trump of cozying up to ""dictators and tyrants"" and has been highly critical of his summits with Kim, calling the meetings ""three made-for-TV summits.""

Biden campaign Rapid Response Director Andrew Bates fired back Friday, saying: ""It's becoming more and more obvious that repugnant dictators, as well as those who admire and 'love' them, find Joe Biden threatening. That's because he'd restore American leadership in the world on day one by putting our security, interests, and values at the heart of our foreign policy.""



Speculating further, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency believes North Korea’s Biden insults were an appeal to Trump, who has continued to describe his personal relationship with Kim as good despite a stalemate in nuclear negotiations over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief and disarmament steps.

The networks are always and forever going to try to beat this president senseless with negative coverage.

It's out of control.

The latest study by the Media Research Center's Rich Noyes finds that during the six weeks since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the inquiry (Sept. 24 through Nov. 5), ""the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts churned out 398 minutes of coverage to the Ukraine scandal."" Important, yes, but it's ""more than three-fifths of all administration news during this period."" It neatly resembles their fiendish obsession with their last ""fake news"" chapter: Trump and Russia.

JASON CHAFFETZ: WHY SCHIFF'S WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS AT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE

Here's what's truly amazing. The tone of overall coverage was 96 percent negative. That makes the long-running average of 90 percent look good.

The negativity is both bombastic and shameless. On Oct. 29, ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell touted ""bombshell impeachment testimony"" in her opening tease and then turned to the first report. ""We're going to begin with that damning impeachment testimony today from a key witness,"" she said.

The same night, NBC chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson also enthusiastically promoted ""bombshell testimony"" from ""a firsthand witness to the explosive conversation that ignited the impeachment inquiry.""

This allegedly dynamite testimony was behind closed doors, and there was no audio or video, but the networks sold it anyway.

The Media Research Center also reports that Joe Biden bizarrely received the best press of his campaign (71 percent positive), as reporters robotically repeated the mantra that ""there is no evidence of any wrongdoing"" by Biden or his profiteering son Hunter Biden in Ukraine. Trump bad, Bidens good.

And they have no interest in pursuing the one question Republicans keep asking: What did Hunter Biden do in return for 50 grand per month?

These networks can't find time for any good news for this president, or for the country. Despite a 50-year low in the unemployment rate and record stock market highs, Trump's handling of the economy was almost completely squashed. Facts about the booming economy drew just 4 minutes and 6 seconds of coverage during these six weeks. That's less than 1 percent of all news on the Trump administration.

Here's the one that puts everything in its proper perspective. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was the world's most dangerous terrorist -- was. The U.S. commander in chief took him out. How did the media cover his role in it? The tone was 67 percent negative! They criticized him for anything they could find, from his refusal to brief congressional leaders to his swaggering commentary on how this foul terrorist died disgracefully by blowing himself up.

NBC News correspondent Courtney Kube speculated and said, ""It's possible that President Trump's bellicose language about the manner in which he died could actually inspire some ISIS fighters to retaliate."" And it's possible that NBC's perennially bellicose language against the Republicans could backfire.

So, let's repeat. The economy is going gangbusters. We beheaded the leadership of ISIS. And President Trump's overall evening-news coverage was 96 percent negative. How can they look into the teleprompters with a straight face?

TRUMP CASTS LOUISIANA VOTE AS IMPEACHMENT REFERENDUM

USA Today: “President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. … ‘The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,’ Trump said. ‘Let's keep it going for a while.’ … Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. … ‘You gotta give me a big win please,’ Trump told the crowd. ‘Please.’”



Will black voters rally for Edwards? - FiveThirtyEight: “While election forecasters like Sabato’s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that’s not the only thing that matters for Edwards’ candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. … And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.”



Bevin cries uncle - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “An upbeat Andy Beshear claimed victory — again — in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he would not contest the results of the close election. ‘The race is now officially over,’ Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.”



New map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: “Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. ‘I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,’ said Republican Rep. David Lewis, one of the legislature’s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps. As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.”



TRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION

Fox News: “Roger Stone was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks’ possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump’s campaign.”



Tensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: “Tensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of ‘gagging’ the lawmaker. … The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine… Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked ‘turned bad.’ Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it ‘witness intimidation.’ Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ‘It's very intimidating.’”



Legal woes mount for Giuliani - Bloomberg: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.”



Career White House budget official to testify - WaPo: “A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.”



THE RULEBOOK: THE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY, INDEED

“If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm, from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections, than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 61



TIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY

Smithsonian: “Founded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol’s] primary product—a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper—was no longer in demand and the firm’s future looked bleak. Fortunately, the sister-in-law of one of its principals had an idea: let kids play with it. Kutol Products had become the largest wallpaper cleaner manufacturer in the world in the early 20th century. Fortunes began to change in the 1950s, though. With the transition from heating with dirtier coal to cleaner oil, gas and electricity, sooty buildup on wallpaper was no longer an issue in many households. Joseph McVicker was trying to turn around the struggling company when his sister-in-law read an article about how wallpaper cleaner could be used for modeling projects. Sister-in-law Kay Zufall, a nursery school teacher, tested the nontoxic material with children, who loved molding it into all kinds of shapes. She told McVicker of her discovery and even suggested a new name: Play-Doh.”

BIDEN BREACHES WARREN’S NEVADA FIREBREAK

Fox News: “Democrats’ strong desire for a candidate who can defeat President Trump gives Joe Biden the edge in the nomination race, while Hispanic voters help both Biden and Bernie Sanders top Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups. That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).”



Poll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump - Fox News: “North Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.”



North Korean news agency calls Biden a ‘rabid dog’ - ABC News: “After a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied Kim Jong Un was a ‘tyrant,’ North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a ‘rabid dog’ and advocated that rabid dogs ‘can hurt lots of people’ and ‘must be beaten to death with a stick.’ … The ad for Biden said, in part: ‘We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised -- our allies, pushed aside.’ Kim's photo appears at the mention of the word ‘tyrants.’ The Biden campaign hit back, calling Kim a ‘repugnant dictator,’ arguing that sharp words from North Korea highlight the strength of their candidate.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Mr. Stirewalt: Why doesn't the President simply claim whistleblower status for himself? U.S. law prohibits adverse actions against anyone reporting suspicion of wrongdoing. I looked -- it doesn't say the report must be made to a US authority. … Clearly, the President disclosed information that he believed evidenced violation of ANY law (including the law of Ukraine), a gross waste of funds, and an abuse of authority. He should therefore be protected against any adverse action as a result. (I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like a gift-wrapped solution . . . am I missing something?)” – Michael Whalen, Weirton, W. Va.



[Ed. note: I’m not sure how facetious you’re being, Mr. Whalen, but this note will always make allowances for readers from West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle! I guess I’d have to ask in reply: Protection from what? If it’s protection from Congress that you seek, I’m afraid not. Congress’ power to impeach is absolute. The president does have many protections in dealing with Congress – shielding intimate advisers from testifying about private conversations, etc. – but when it comes to impeachment, Congress is at the apex of its powers. Go Red Riders!]

Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm. Category One Hurricane Dorian created a ‘mini-tsunami’ that swept cattle and some 30 wild horses from Cedar Island into the ocean when it struck on September 6. The cows were identified by their keeper, Woody Hancock. They will likely be sedated and sent home on a boat…”

Kamala Harris, whose campaign cut staff in a dramatic restructuring last month, is now polling at just 3 percent, tying her with Michael Bloomberg for fifth place among the Democratic Party’s presidential nominees -- according to a poll released Friday -- even though Bloomberg hasn't even formally announced his 2020 candidacy.

And now Harris may be facing another problem: A second report Friday described internal strife at Harris’ Baltimore campaign headquarters, with several aides calling for campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s resignation following his late October decision to lay off field staffers in several states and dedicate Harris' already dwindling campaign war chest to a seven-figure TV ad campaign before the February Iowa caucus.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE'S 'ALL IN' ON IOWA -- DESPITE CAMPAIGN RESTRUCTURING, LAYOFFS

Harris and Bloomberg were deadlocked in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Nov. 12-14. Though not yet a declared candidate, Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul, launched a massive $100 million digital ad campaign Friday targeting President Trump.

In the poll, both Harris and Bloomberg fell behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who polled at 6 percent, and Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who polled at 13 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led the Demicratic field tied at 19 percent support.

Rodriguez said in an Oct. 30 campaign memo obtained by Fox News that several dozen people would be laid off at the campaign's Baltimore headquarters -- as would volunteers in New Hampshire, Nevada, and California -- in an effort to go ""all-in"" in Iowa. He also said the campaign aimed to dedicate $1 million to a media campaign in the weeks before the Feb. 3 caucus, a figure now considered unlikely given Harris’ lackluster funding.

Three additional staff members were laid off and another quit in recent days at Harris’ campaign headquarters in Baltimore, unnamed aides told Politico on Friday. They said several aides have approached campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, to force Rodriguez to step down, claiming his failed leadership is responsible for the campaign’s recent troubles.

One official said Harris’ current campaign structure has “No discipline. No plan. No strategy.”

“It’s a campaign of id,” the official continued. “What feels right, what impulse you have right now, what emotion, what frustration.”

But others defended Rodriguez, saying he’s been loyal to Harris even before she first announced her candidacy in January. They pointed fingers at Maya Harris, who shared leadership responsibility with Rodriguez.

“From the outset of this race, he has had all the responsibility with none of the authority. He’s been managing this race with at least one, if not two, hands tied behind his back,” a senior campaign official told Politico of Rodriguez. “He would never undermine her. He’s just not that guy.”

The Politico report cited 12 individuals – who were either current or former campaign staffers or donors – who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, Harris has been crisscrossing the country to try to salvage support. Her campaign has struggled to regain traction after an initial stand-out moment in the race during the first Democratic debate in June when she challenged Biden, a frontrunner, over comments he made about segregationist U.S. senators and school busing. Harris struggled in the second debate after Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, challenged her record as California's attorney general. She struggled to shine in subsequent debates.

But if the State Department’s George Kent and Acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor are representative of the testimony Democrats are relying on, future historians may label this episode The Big Impeachment Blowout.

The House impeachment inquiry is not a criminal proceeding. But as I listened to the hearsay and speculation that Kent and Taylor were offering Wednesday at the opening public hearing on impeachment, I couldn’t help thinking of REO Speedwagon’s song “Take it on the Run.”

One line of the song says: “Heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend who heard it from another you been messin’ around.”

YOVANOVITCH TO FACE GOP GRILLING ON SECOND DAY OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Both Kent and Taylor admitted they never talked to President Trump and only heard third-hand what supposedly occurred in the president’s July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats seem to have dropped the quid pro quo claim, since there was no evidence of it in the rough transcript the White House released of the call. The claim does not seem to be playing with the American public.

Taylor admitted in the hearing that Zelensky had no idea that U.S. aid was being delayed, and Zelensky himself has said there was no quid pro quo.

Democrats have now switched to using the terms “bribery” and “extortion,” no doubt because those terms sound more sinister, despite the fact that they’ve produced no evidence – so far – that would come even close to showing a violation of the federal laws defining bribery and extortion.

Both witnesses expressed their opinions disagreeing with the way President Trump has conducted diplomatic relations with Ukraine and the handling of U.S. aid to the country.

But the president is not a postman for Congress or the State Department. His job is to faithfully execute the law. As the chief diplomat of the United States, he defines our foreign policy, not George Kent or William Taylor.

Our country doesn’t give money or aid to other countries for no reason. We give it with specific conditions attached.

The president has a duty to make sure that our money is going to countries that will use it as we intend and not divert it into profiteering and personal corruption. State Department bureaucrats have never been good at ensuring that countries prevent such corruption.

The priority of our diplomats is to maintain their access to government officials in the countries in which they are stationed. This too often overrides their duty to guard against corruption. The president has the final responsibility for ensuring U.S. aid is not improperly diverted in other nations.

It was widely known that Ukraine had, and still has, a corruption problem. It would have been irresponsible for Trump not to look into corruption and demand changes before our money went there.

Even Kent admitted in his testimony that Burisma, the Ukrainian company that employed Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter as a highly paid board member, was part of the “pervasive and longstanding corruption in Ukraine.”

Of course, we will not hear any facts about that because Chairman Schiff has refused to allow the Republicans to call Hunter Biden as a witness, which would enable the younger Biden’s possible self-dealing in Ukraine to be investigated.

If everything Hunter Biden and his father Joe did was ethical and above board when it came to Ukraine, why wouldn’t Democrats want Hunter Biden to testify?

And why has Schiff’s committee blocked the Republicans from being able to call the so-called whistleblower who started this whole show-trial that Democrats call an impeachment inquiry? What are they afraid will come out about this government employee that might damage his credibility and the claims he is making?

Apparently, Schiff doesn’t want any testimony that would support the legitimacy of the president’s corruption concerns about Ukraine or would somehow detract from the impeachment narrative Democrats are trying to weave into the minds of the American public.

We certainly won’t have an objective, bipartisan inquiry into all of the relevant aspects of what happened here – and why it happened. Schiff even interrupted Republican questioning to tell witnesses they should not answer questions based on “facts not in evidence,” a bizarre statement given the nature of a congressional hearing and how it is normally conducted.

Adam Schiff used to be an assistant U.S. attorney – a federal prosecutor. Like all people in that position, he had to follow the U.S. Attorneys’ Justice Manual.

Before taking a case to a grand jury, much less to trial, Schiff had to convince his boss, in writing, that he had evidence establishing a case. He couldn’t just wing it and submit a case, however weak, based entirely on hearsay, to the grand jury on the off-chance it would indict.

Yet that is exactly what Schiff is doing here – throwing witnesses into closed and now open hearings hoping that he can stir the political pot into an impeachment boil.

It would undermine our system of government for a duly elected president to be removed through impeachment for partisan reasons.

Impeachment should only be used when there has been serious, substantial misconduct of such a nature that we can’t wait for the next election. As far as is publicly known at this time, that standard has not been met regarding President Trump.

Deval Patrick into the race, further dividing Democrats in their battle to pick a nominee to challenge President Trump in 2020.

This is good news for Trump, especially if it causes the crowded field to devolve into a bitter negative campaign. The more time Democrats spend attacking each other, the less time they have to attack the president.

In addition, Trump would be able to use the attacks by Democrats on their eventual nominee in ads when he runs against that person next year.

Patrick is a former assistant U.S. attorney general and was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, becoming the first African-American to hold that position.

Former New York City Mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hasn’t made an official declaration of his candidacy yet, but seems certain to do so in the near future. He’s already filed to run in at least two states and is reportedly hiring staff across the country.

And 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the BBC that she’s “under enormous pressure” to run again in 2020, and has refused to rule it out. But it seems unlikely that the former first lady, senator and secretary state will make a third presidential run at this late date, although it’s understandable why she could find it tempting.

Not counting Bloomberg and Clinton, 17 Democrats remain in the race for their party’s presidential nomination, though most have virtually no chance of winning the contest. Eight other Democrats have dropped out of the nomination race even before the first votes are cast.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., are atop the polls in the presidential contest. Right now it looks like only a handful of other candidates have even a longshot chance of capturing the nomination.

Patrick joins the Democratic race with the rumored tacit blessing of former President Barack Obama, who may be frustrated by the failure of any other candidate – particularly Biden, his vice president – to both consolidate the field and demonstrate a clear ability to defeat President Trump.

But there is evidence that Democratic primary voters are actually happy with the current crop of candidates.

The most recent Fox News Poll showed 69 percent of Democrats are satisfied with the field as it now stands. That’s particularly true among the more liberal wing of the party – which is split between supporters of self-described democratic socialist Sanders and Warren. Among the liberals, 71 percent are satisfied with the field.

More moderate Democrats appear slightly less satisfied than liberals. The polls suggest they’d be fine with Biden, particularly given his apparent strength against Trump in the general election.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off.

However, there’s a nagging feeling about Biden. Yes, he was exceedingly effective in both the 2008 and 2012 vice presidential candidate debates. But that was a long time ago. He will turn 77 on Wednesday and is showing his age, stumbling a few times in past debates and appearances and sometimes looking like he is past his prime.

The age issue has also been raised with Sanders, who is 78 and is back on the campaign trail after recently suffering a heart attack. It would certainly be raised with Bloomberg, who is 77, and could be raised with Warren, who is 70. However, the 73-year-old Trump would have a hard time attacking any of these candidates as being too old to be president.

Despite Biden’s imperfect performance to date, none of the other center-left candidates – I call them the “junior Bidens” – has managed to achieve real prominence.

Buttigieg has done extremely well in appearances and seems to have a very effective organization in Iowa. But only 30 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say he can beat Trump – compared to 68 percent who say that about Biden, and almost 60 percent who say that about Sanders and Warren.

That leaves running room – or at least dreaming room – for Patrick and Bloomberg. Can you blame either one for looking in the mirror each morning and thinking he can beat Biden?

Patrick had a strong and moderate, record as governor of Massachusetts. Though he starts with no organization and little money, he is hoping for a solid showing in Iowa and to then eclipse Biden in New Hampshire, which borders Massachusetts.

If Patrick makes a credible showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’d be in a position to win the South Carolina primary, where about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black. However, right now Biden enjoys very strong support among black voters – outpacing African-American candidates who joined the race months ago – so it would be premature to assume Patrick would come out on top in South Carolina.

One potential weakness for Patrick is that he just left a partnership at Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Yes, Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, former GOP presidential nominee, and current senator from Utah.

Patrick will certainly get attacked for his work at Bain by Sanders and Warren, who have proposed a slew of new taxes on wealthy individuals and on businesses, along with new regulations on the private sector.

However, I have trouble seeing how a caricature of a “rich fat cat” will stick to Patrick, who is the son of a single mother living in the Chicago projects, and who won scholarships to a fancy prep school and Harvard.

Still, the polls in New Hampshire suggest Patrick is not well-known there, despite an eight-year track record as governor next door.

And unlike Bloomberg, Patrick will need to expend significant time and effort raising money.

The smart money says it’s too late for Patrick to become the Democratic presidential nominee.

My own sense is that if Patrick can raise the contributions and hit the poll numbers needed to get into one of the upcoming Democratic presidential candidate debates, his optimistic message might enable him to beat the odds. Primary politics is a strange beast – and, yes, lightning does sometimes strike.

Remember that when then-Sen. Barack Obama first announced his presidential candidacy, many “experts” said America was not ready to elect a black president. And when Trump first announced he was running for president many pundits wrote him off as a publicity-seeking reality-TV star with no chance of getting the Republican nomination.

Bloomberg, whose net worth is said to be north of $50 billion, has the advantage of being able to write a check to amply fund his campaign and mount a multistate effort. However, his intention to self-fund will keep him out of Democratic presidential debates unless the rules to qualify are changed. That would present him with a big disadvantage.

At the same time, Bloomberg’s opposition to many of the far-left proposals of Sanders and Warren may wind up helping those two candidates more than hurting them with the liberal Democratic electorate.

“With enemies like Mike, he’ll wind up deepening their support,” one wag joked, about Sanders and Warren, “and here we thought they’ve renounced super PACs.”

The recent Fox News poll suggested that only 6 percent of Democratic primary voters would definitely support Bloomberg, while 32 would “never vote for him.” That’s a big disadvantage to overcome.

Bloomberg’s strategy is based on not entering any contests until the Super Tuesday primaries March 3 – after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina vote.

Sixteen states – including the two most populous, California and Texas – hold primaries on Super Tuesday. They will divide up roughly 36 percent of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The four early states will have only about 4 percent of convention delegates.

Bloomberg’s hope is that no two candidates will emerge as strong contenders after the first four nominating contests. Given how quickly previous nomination contests have been defined by the initial results, I wouldn’t put too much stock in that hope. Few things are certain in politics, but Iowa will winnow the field, and New Hampshire will likely define it.

Of course, politics remains unpredictable, with new developments able to shake up races significantly.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off. This unpredictability is one of the things that makes politics so interesting.

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends: Weekend,"" Bongino said Democrats don't have a leg to stand on and that the whistleblower was factually incorrect.

In an exclusive interview Friday on ""The Dan Bongino Show,"" the president sounded off on the impeachment inquiry, saying ""everybody knows who the whistleblower is"" and the person ""has to be revealed.""

ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR ACCUSES LEFT OF SYSTEMIC 'SABOTAGE' OF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

""The whistleblower wrote a report which was mostly on the phone call that everybody now sees was a good call,"" Trump said. ""So, fortunately, the call was transcribed by experts and transcribed beautifully. And that was the call when they saw it, when I released it. Then everything started going downhill.""

""It was a great interview,"" Bongino told ""Fox & Friends"" hosts Ed Henry, Lisa Boothe and Pete Hegseth. ""I'll tell you, it was going on during Ambassador Yovanovitch's testimony. And the president was, I think rightfully so, furious about what's going on.""

On Friday former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified in a public hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. She said she was ousted after a smear campaign led by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was trying to get dirt on the president's Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.

But Yovanovitch could not supply the panel with information regarding any criminal activity or bribes involving Trump.

Bongino said he believes the president is so angry about the impeachment inquiry ""because he really genuinely feels -- and I wholeheartedly agree based on actual evidence what Democrats don't have -- that he didn't do anything wrong.""

""So, he's furious about it, and I don't blame him for wanting to find out how the whistleblower got this thing so wrong,"" Bongino said.

Yovanovitch was the third witness in the formal inquiry to testify publicly. Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, and senior State Department official George Kent testified Wednesday.

""Do you realize there are three ringer witnesses -- Kent, Taylor, and Yovanovitch -- not one of them has any evidence of a crime?"" Bongino questioned.

""What are we doing here? Why are we wasting America's time?"" he asked."

This is the main takeaway from the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry of President Trump that moves into its second day of public hearings Friday. More witnesses are certain to confirm Trump’s misconduct.

The unfortunate truth is that instead of pursuing America’s national interest by giving Ukraine nearly $400 million in assistance to resist invading Russian military forces, Trump tried to extort Zelensky to benefit Trump’s personal political interests. This is not what our presidents are supposed to do.

TRUMP HAMMERS DEMS FOR IMPEACHMENT FOCUS AT LOUISIANA RALLY: 'WE DID NOTHING WRONG -- AND THEY'RE DOING NOTHING'

Trump saw former Vice President Joe Biden as his likely Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, and so sought to get Zelensky to launch an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter (who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company) that would smear the former vice president’s reputation and make Biden less likely to be elected president.

Trump’s action was unquestionably improper, and many people – including me – believe it was illegal.

The Democratic-controlled House will have to decide this issue when it votes on whether to impeach Trump. If it does, the Republican-controlled Senate will have to hold a trial to determine if Trump’s conduct warrants his removal from office.

No president has ever been removed from office by Congress, though President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 to avoid likely removal if he had gone to trial in the Senate in the Watergate scandal.

Trump’s Republican defenders in the House and Senate argue that since Trump eventually released the aid to Ukraine without getting Ukraine to investigate the Bidens he did nothing wrong.

But as Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said at the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearing Wednesday: “Is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted robbery a crime? Is attempted bribery and extortion a crime?”

We all know the answers to these questions: yes, yes and yes.

Trump’s attempted crime was interrupted by a whistleblower filing a complaint about the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call and news stories disclosing this. Without the whistleblower complaint, all indications are that Zelensky would have ordered the investigation of the Bidens – along with an investigation of a debunked claim that Ukraine interfered in our 2016 presidential election on behalf of Hillary Clinton.

Trump demanded both investigations in return for giving Ukraine the U.S. aid that had been approved by Congress, and had blocked the release of the aid as part of his plan to extort Zelensky to meet his demands. Only disclosure of the Trump attempted extortion prompted him to give Ukraine the aid it desperately needed.

At Wednesday’s impeachment hearing, acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent were perfect witnesses and gave damning testimony against President Trump.

Trump’s action was unquestionably improper, and many people – including me – believe it was illegal.

Taylor and Kent came off as nonpartisan, patriotic, researched and consistent. Their attention to detail was on full display, having taken copious notes documenting every aspect of their experience with Trump’s wrongful conduct regarding Ukraine.

Taylor even came with new information since his closed-door deposition in late October that gave additional fodder to the central charge of this impeachment inquiry: President Trump was trading arms for dirt on his political opponent.

Taylor reported that his aide David Holmes heard U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland on the phone with Trump on July 26 discussing the investigations Trump wanted into the Bidens and our 2016 election.

Holmes then asked Sondland what the president “thought about Ukraine.” According to Taylor, ""Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.”

The Associated Press reported Thursday that a second diplomatic staffer, Suriya Jayanti, also overheard the conversation between Sondland and Trump. Trump has said he doesn’t recall this July 26 call, the day after his conversation with Zelensky.

Doesn’t recall? That sure is convenient.

I expect Ambassador Sondland will be amending his testimony one more time to account for these new details.

Protest as Republicans might, all the dots have been connected to show Trump’s unquestionable misconduct. The timeline that exists now is incredibly damaging to Trump.

February: Congress approves $391 million in military aid to Ukraine.

Feb. 28: Trump tells Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that the aid to Ukraine will be released immediately.

July 25: The Trump-Zelensky phone call takes place. Trump mentions the Bidens and tells the Ukrainian president “I would like you to do us a favor though” and launch investigations, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.

Sept. 9: The Justice Department informs the House of the whistleblower complaint raising serious concerns about the Trump-Zelensky call.

Sept. 11: Trump releases the congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine.

The order of events is critical to undermining the Republicans’ argument, since they have been relying on the fact that there couldn’t have been a quid pro quo because U.S. military aid was released without investigations.

As the timeline shows, Trump’s attempted crime was interrupted by the whistleblower complaint being filed. What’s more, our legal system holds people accountable for attempted crimes. Plenty of people are serving time in our prisons and jails for crimes they tried but failed to carry out because they were foiled in the act.

Republicans have also been arguing that since Zelensky said much later that he didn’t feel pressured by Trump in the July 25 call, nothing inappropriate had happened. It is obvious Zelensky said that because he feared angering Trump, which could create future problems for Ukraine.

But after Wednesday’s testimony, we know that the Ukrainians were acutely aware of what was happening with the withholding of vital U.S. aid, and felt pressure to do the bidding of Trump and Trump’s personal attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Not only did Giuliani publicly state that these investigations would be “very helpful” to Trump, but Taylor testified that Sondland told him that he had personally encouraged Zelensky to make it clear to Trump that Zelensky was committed to the investigations.

Additionally, Ukraine’s national security adviser told Taylor that Zelensky did not wish to be a pawn in a U.S. political campaign five days before the call occurred. By September, there are a number of indications that not only did the Ukrainians feel pressured, but they also knew that the American aid had been frozen, according to the testimony of Taylor and Tim Morrison, formerly of the National Security Council.

Republicans tried desperately at the Wednesday hearing to divert attention from the real issues at hand by promoting conspiracy theories like the claim that the Ukrainians interfered in our 2016 election or that there was something sinister going on vis-à-vis the Bidens and gas company Burisma.

Kent and Taylor quickly knocked down these claims. But I expect that Republicans will continue to promote these fairytales that make the president seem a little bit less corrupt to his base.

Now the truth has come out. And more will come out as more witnesses testify about President Trump’s misconduct.

Because the Senate would need the votes of 20 Republicans to remove Trump from office if he is impeached by the House, the odds are that he will remain in office.

But the House impeachment inquiry will shed needed light on how Trump has improperly used his office for his personal benefit, giving voters important information to consider when they cast ballots in the 2020 presidential election.

In between were tense squabbles among lawmakers over the rules for the impeachment hearing proceedings, with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, at one point snapping at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that his party's ""indulgence with you wore out a long time ago.""

And Republicans were able to extract some noteworthy statements from the witness, including an admission that despite allegations President Trump withheld support to Ukraine in exchange for politically advantageous investigations, it was Trump – not his predecessor, Barack Obama – who ultimately provided “defensive lethal aid” to Kiev.

TRUMP ATTACKS MARIE YOVANOVITCH DURING IMPEACHMENT HEARING, SAYS EVERYWHERE SHE WENT 'TURNED BAD'

But while Yovanovitch testified that she was “kneecapped” by the administration – with some choice words for Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – and Democrats sought to draw attention to what they called the “smear campaign” against her, the day in Washington largely turned on the early-morning Trump tweets. Shortly after the hearing began, Trump fired back in real time, claiming that every place Yovanovitch worked ""turned bad.""

He charged: “She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.”

Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Schiff read Trump's tweet during the hearing, and called it “witness intimidation.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., when asked about the tweet, echoed: ""Witness intimidation is a crime.""

Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ""It's very intimidating."" Democrats on the sidelines of the hearing crowed that the tweet itself could prompt a new article of impeachment against the president.

But the White House fired back at the claims, with Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham declaring: “The tweet was not witness intimidation, it was simply the President’s opinion, which he is entitled to.” She went on to say, ""This is not a trial, it is a partisan political process - or to put it more accurately, a totally illegitimate, charade stacked against the President. There is less due process in this hearing than any such event in the history of our country. It’s a true disgrace.”

It remains to be seen whether that moment and the fallout from it will fuel Democrats’ impeachment case or fade as a parade of other witnesses appear next week before the same committee. But the incident reflected an escalating political environment, with Democrats eager to turn Trump’s trademark attack-mode against him.

Republicans acknowledged the Trump tweet was not helpful, with one senior GOP source telling Fox News: “We didn’t need that.” But Republicans nevertheless worked to draw out witness statements to support their general argument that no quid pro quo took place because, despite Trump’s conversations, the aid to Ukraine was delivered – after a delay – without the investigations he sought.

THE IMPEACHMENT HEARING WITNESSES: WHO IS MARIE YOVANOVITCH?

Earlier in the hearing, Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who has served both Republican and Democratic presidents, relayed in detail her story of being suddenly recalled by Trump in May, saying she believes Giuliani played a key role in telling people she was not sufficiently supportive of the president.

“I do not understand Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me, nor can I offer an opinion on whether he believed the allegations he spread about me,” Yovanovitch said.

She argued the efforts against her by the president's allies hindered her work.

“If our chief representative is kneecapped, it limits our effectiveness to safeguard the vital national security interests of the United States,” Yovanovitch said.

Yovanovitch's removal is one of several events at the center of the impeachment effort.

""These events should concern everyone in this room,"" Yovanovitch said in her opening remarks. ""Shady interests the world over have learned how little it takes to remove an American ambassador who does not give them what they want.""

Democrats have worked to connect the circumstances of Yovanovitch’s ouster to Trump’s alleged pressure campaign to enlist Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an effort to damage potential 2020 rival Joe Biden.

“Some have argued, that a president has the ability to nominate or remove any ambassador he wants, that they serve at the pleasure of the president. And that is true,” Schiff said. “The question before us is not whether Donald Trump could recall an American ambassador with a stellar reputation for fighting corruption in Ukraine, but why would he want to?”

Republicans portrayed the hearing as a waste of time.

“It’s unfortunate that today, and for most of next week, we will continue engaging in the Democrats’ day-long TV spectacles instead of solving the problems we were all sent to Washington to address,” Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

Kayleigh McEnany, Trump campaign press secretary, stressed after the hearing concluded that the president can dismiss an ambassador at any time. “This has been a complete waste of everyone’s time and a disservice to the taxpayers,” she said in a statement.

Yovanovitch and others have described Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, as leading what one called an “irregular channel” outside the diplomatic mainstream of U.S.-Ukraine relations. Giuliani and others had claimed Yovanovitch was not supportive of the president and that she had criticized him to others. Trump, in a conversation with Zelensky, referred to her as “bad news.”

Asked on Friday what she thought of those comments from Trump, she said, “I couldn’t believe it. Shocked appalled. Devastated.” She said recent months had been a ""difficult time"" for her.

Schiff claimed Friday she was ""too tough on corruption for some, and her principled stance made her enemies” and it became clear Trump “wanted her gone.""

Giuliani also blasted Yovanovich during her testimony, noting that he collected information from “a number of witnesses” about her. In a lengthy statement to Fox News, Giuliani accused Yovanovich, and the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, of “being involved in blatant partisan political activities during the 2016 election.”

“The information I obtained was in the nature of evidence form a number of witnesses. All of them, some allies, some opponents, agreed on Ambassador Yovanovich’s wrongdoing,” Giuliani said, adding that the witnesses “could testify among other things that she blocked Ukrainian witnesses who had evidence of illegal interference in 2016 election from getting visas and coming to the U.S.”

Elsewhere in the hearing, tensions between lawmakers boiled over when Schiff repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Nunes accused him of ""gagging"" the lawmaker.

""This is the fifth time you have interrupted a duly-elected member of Congress,"" Stefanik told Schiff, who repeatedly told her she was ""not recognized"" to speak.

The moment began when Nunes yielded the remainder of his allotted time for questions to Stefanik, who had sparred multiple times with Schiff during both days of hearings.

But as Stefanik spoke, Schiff slammed down the gavel: ""The gentlewoman will suspend.""

""What is the interruption for now?"" she shot back.

What followed was a debate between Nunes and Schiff as to whether the Republican could offer his time to a fellow member of Congress, rather than minority counsel. Stefanik repeatedly tried to speak, only for Schiff to bang his gavel again.

""You're gagging the member from New York?"" Nunes laughed at one point.

It was one of a number of clashes over the hearing's procedure. Before the testimony began Friday, Schiff shut down Stefanik for the first time after Stefanik asked if he would “continue to prohibit witnesses from answering Republican questions.” Schiff said it wasn’t a “proper” point of order, and then declined to recognize Jordan, who also tried to raise a parliamentary question.

Questioning under GOP counsel Steve Castor also turned to the issue of alleged Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election – namely reports that former DNC consultant Alexandra Chalupa had meetings during the race with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington to discuss incriminating information about Trump campaign figures.

Yovanovitch said she did not believe she knew Chalupa. Further, when asked if she tried to investigate those interactions, she maintained this would have been handled in the U.S. since the meetings took place in Washington, not in Ukraine. Further, while Ukraine documents eventually were released that were damaging to former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort, Yovanovitch testified that she still doesn’t have information to suggest any effort to target then-candidate Trump.

At its core, the impeachment inquiry concerns Trump’s July call with Zelensky that first came to attention when an anonymous government whistleblower filed a complaint. In the phone conversation, Trump asked for a “favor,” according to an account provided by the White House. He wanted an investigation of Democrats and 2020 rival Joe Biden. Later, it was revealed that the administration was also withholding military aid from Ukraine, which Democrats have alleged was part of a ""quid pro quo"" for the investigations.

Republicans continued to push back on that claim on Friday, arguing that the aid was delivered -- after a delay -- without any such investigation. Stefanik specifically asked Yovanovitch about ""defensive lethal aid"" that she had advocated for.

""That was not provided by President Obama, it was provided by President Trump?"" she asked.

""That's correct,"" Yovanovitch replied.

At the same time the hearing began Friday, the White House released a new transcript of the president’s first call with Zelensky, which showed Trump agreeing to meet with Ukraine’s president-elect -- without preconditions -- in the first official phone call between the two leaders.

PRESIDENT TRUMP AGREES TO MEET UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS, WHITE HOUSE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS

Nunes read the entire letter in his opening statement. A separate call between the two leaders ignited the impeachment inquiry, and Republicans suggested the new transcript is helpful to the president's argument he did nothing wrong in his conversations with Zelensky.

Americans are deeply entrenched in two camps over impeachment, resulting in a mounting political battle that will further test the nation in one of the most polarizing eras of modern times. After the hearing, the Democratic National Committee said that ""in removing Yovanovitch, Trump freed himself to commit a gross abuse of power.""

""The corruption revealed today, corruption that jeopardized our national security and the integrity of our next election, originated from the person sitting in the Oval Office,"" DNC War Room Director Adrienne Watson said.

Pelosi on Thursday brushed aside the Latin phrase “quid pro quo” that Democrats have been using to describe Trump’s actions with a more colloquial one: Bribery.

Trump continued to assail the proceedings as “a hoax” on Thursday, and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., dismissed the witness testimony as hearsay, at best second-hand information.

But as the hearing's ending approached, there were signs of drama to come next week. David Holmes, the Ukraine Embassy staffer who reportedly heard a call between E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Trump that was a highlight of acting Ambassador Bill Taylor's testimony on Wednesday, arrived for a closed-door hearing.

Yovanovitch, meanwhile, received a standing ovation from people in the gallery as she departed the hearing room.

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends: Weekend"" with hosts Ed Henry and Lisa Boothe on Saturday, Senior Legal Adviser for Trump 2020 Campaign Jenna Ellis Rives said what the American people saw in the impeachment hearings ""is that the Democrats actually have zero evidence.""

Rives said, ""What we have right now is the burden of proof on the Democrats and they can't show it.""

The Democrats' probe was initiated after a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general about the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy.

CHRIS STEWART TAKEDOWN OF YOVANOVITCH SHOWS DEMOCRATS HAVE 'NO CASE,' GOP SAYS

On the call, Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into Ukrainian election meddling in the 2016 presidential race and into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

Zelensky, though, has said he felt no pressure during the call. The White House has maintained no wrongdoing, and the president has repeatedly said the call was “perfect,” arguing that it contained “no quid pro quo.”

Within the last week, Democrats have notably shifted their rhetoric to accusing the president of bribery instead of quid pro quo.

Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett said, ""Bribery is nothing more than a quid pro quo -- an exchange of benefits. But, if the recipient of the quid is oblivious to the quo, it's a legal impossibility for there to be a quid pro quo.""

He said that Democrats are looking for ""any excuse, any pretext, to impeach the president"" because ""they are driven by hatred or bias.""

Former Chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee Jason Chaffetz added that he believes the ""evidence is that Donald Trump was much tougher on Russia than Barack Obama was.""

He told the hosts the investigation was all ""just a charade"" the Democrats were perpetuating and that he had wished Republicans had moved to adjourn the hearing after Yovanovitch told Rep. Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, that she could supply the panel with no information regarding criminal activity or bribes that President Trump may have been involved with.

""Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the president of the United States has been involved with at all?"" asked Stewart.

""No,"" Yovanovitch said.

""The American people know this is nonsense,"" Stewart added. ""The American people know this is unfair.""

""It's a complete sham,"" Rives concluded. ""This is just a political maneuver in the court of public opinion to take out a duly elected president.""

We need to settle back in our seats because neither side is giving an inch.

Did the Democrats strengthen their case against President Trump? Who were the winners and losers? Did former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch have it right when she testified Friday that she can’t say if President Trump bribed anyone or committed a crime?

Time will tell, but here are my seven takeaways and some winners and losers from the first week of public impeachment hearings, held Wednesday and Friday.

ADAM SCHIFF TO TRUMP IN IMPEACHMENT HEARING: 'STOP OBSTRUCTING'

The stock market doesn’t care

All of the U.S. stock exchanges are at or near all-time highs. Could it be that the bull market assumes that the impeachment hearings will amount to nothing? Or that investors know Trump is not going to be removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate, and therefore there is no threat to the markets in the year ahead? It would seem so.

The hearings are a political TV show

The Watergate hearings considering the impeachment of President Richard Nixon truly uncovered facts. The House Intelligence Committee hearings chaired by Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., now underway are not fact-finding hearings.

All of the witnesses that Schiff has called or will be calling to testify have had their depositions taken. That means the Democrats already know exactly what their witnesses will say in advance of the public hearing.

As a result, Democrats have scripted their leading questions to score political points – not to uncover facts. Republicans are also able to undertake cross-examination based on what they already know.

This is not an inquiry. This is a made-for-TV political event.

Most Americans don’t find the hearings all that interesting

To their credit, the cable TV news networks are providing full coverage of the hearings. Americans have full access, yet the ratings so far are lower than the congressional hearings for former FBI Director James Comey in 2017 and now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year.

Does that mean that public interest in impeachment is lukewarm? That the public doesn’t trust the impeachment process? Or that most people already have their minds made up on whether Trump should be impeached, as 70 percent said in a recent poll? Or does it mean that most Americans are getting tired of Washington political battles?

Frankly, it is likely all four. Regardless of the exact reason, lukewarm ratings aren’t indicative of a coming rise in support for impeachment.

Do policy differences warrant impeachment?

Three State Department officials have testified so far. A huge percentage of their testimony has been about their opinions and feelings about the Trump administration’s foreign policy goals and conduct. Since when are policy differences the basis of impeachment?

New facts not coming out

There are not many facts in play. If there were, why would Yovanovitch have no information on the call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that prompted the impeachment inquiry, or events thereafter? Why were the first two witnesses “hearsay” witnesses who were barely involved?

Devoid of new facts, the Democrats sought Friday to portray President Trump as a bad guy who was grossly unfair to ambassadors. Is that impeachable?

The imperial Schiff

The late Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., only reluctantly oversaw impeachment proceedings against President Nixon in the House. In contrast, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff has been going after President Trump for the past two years.

Schiff has lied about the facts related to the Trump-Russia collusion investigation and lied about his panel’s contacts with the whistleblower regarding the Trump-Zelensky call on Ukraine. Now he has designated himself the inquisitor in chief in the Trump impeachment inquiry.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Schiff and the partisan counsel for the committee, who pushed the Steele dossier and the lies about Trump’s conduct, have repeatedly asked leading questions chock-full of “facts not in evidence.”

Yet, Schiff warned witnesses this week not to answer Republican questions that included “facts not in evidence.” Meanwhile, he continues to block the testimony of the whistleblower and refuses to give Republicans the transcripts of certain witnesses.

In short, Schiff is running an unfair hearing. Don’t expect that to change as he continues to deny Republicans the right to call certain witnesses, including the so-called whistleblower, despite the assurances of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Schiff that the whistleblower would be a witness.

More proof that this is a staged event – not an actual inquiry.

A political brawl

Given all of that, and the last three years of attacks on President Trump, can anyone be surprised that the president tweeted and spoke poorly of a witness – former Ambassador Yovanovitch?

Always remember that President Bill Clinton and his team relentlessly attacked witnesses and Independent Counsel Ken Starr in the Clinton impeachment – including two women who made sexual misconduct accusations against Clinton.

As for the current impeachment hearings, they are designed to politically wound President Trump at the least – and at most remove him from office. From all we know of Donald Trump, you could well expect more of punching back from this President – all to the delight of his supporters and to the benefit of his fundraising.

Winners & Losers

Winner: Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., for standing up to Schiff on the Intelligence Committee. She wouldn’t be silenced by Schiff and read old tweets from him in which he said the Ukraine whistleblower would testify before the committee – a position Schiff now rejects. Republicans have found a young star. The Democrats must be worried about Stefanik because they are already attacking her.

Loser: Democratic presidential hopefuls. They are all being pushed off the front page because of impeachment coverage, and those serving in the Senate will be sidelined attending Trump’s Senate trial if he is impeached in the House.

Winner: Ukraine. It is getting so much attention that it must seem to be the center of the world for many TV viewers.

Loser::Former Vice President Joe Biden. The witnesses have made clear that Ukraine is a swamp and that his son was highly paid to serve on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. This was – at the very least – a conflict of interest. Every day Biden is tied to Ukraine is not a good day for his already sliding campaign.

Loser. Due process. In the context of these hearings, that assumes equal treatment, reciprocally applied. That is not happening and apparently will not happen. That is the worst thing of all for everyone.

“The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that,” Obama said.

OBAMA SOUNDS OFF ON CANCEL CULTURE, 'WOKE' PURITY: 'THAT'S NOT ACTIVISM'

“There are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don't want to see crazy stuff,"" he said. ""They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.”

The two-term Democratic president made the remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race last year.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines on the 2020 Democratic primary, and has not yet backed a candidate -- even as former Vice President Joe Biden has invoked his name on numerous occasions. But Obama has made remarks indicating he is nervous about the drift to the extreme left on a number of issues by parts of the Democratic Party.

On Friday, he did not mention any candidates by name, but did cite immigration and health care reform as examples of where Democrats may be out of sync with the broader electorate.

Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who have both released plans on immigration and “Medicare-for-all” respectively in recent weeks. Warren’s government-led overhaul of the health care system would eventually abolish private insurance and cost $52 trillion, while Sanders’ immigration plan includes radical policies including welfare for illegal immigrants and a moratorium on all deportations.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The comment about Twitter feeds echoes remarks he made last month, when the former president took a swipe at “woke” virtue signalling and cancel culture, telling a Chicago audience to “get over” their obsessions with ideological purity tests.

“This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said. “The world is messy. There are ambiguities.

That may have been the easy part.

On Friday morning at 9 a.m. ET, the 60-year-old diplomat will take the stand again for Day Two of the public impeachment hearings against President Trump -- and Republicans are set to hammer her with an aggressive cross-examination related to her previous statements under oath, as well as her reported role in shielding a George Soros-linked nonprofit allegedly connected to documented Ukrainian election interference efforts.

“The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news,” was how Trump described Yovanovitch to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call.

“She’s going to go through some things,” the president added ominously.

“The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news. She’s going to go through some things.” — President Trump

Shortly before Yovanovitch was set to take the stand, Fox News contributor John Solomon published an explosive March interview with Yuriy Lutsenko, a former prosecutor general in Ukraine. Lutsenko claimed that Yovanovitch had given him a “do not prosecute” list — and Solomon reported that Yovanovitch pressured Ukrainian prosecutors to back off a case involving the AntiCorruption Action Centre, funded by Soros, the liberal megadonor.

The U.S. Embassy under Yovanovitch, Solomon reported, also influenced Ukraine to drop prosecution against top law enforcement official Artem Sytnyk, who was singled out by a Ukrainian court for leaking damaging information about Paul Manafort, then Trump's campaign chairman, to help Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Ukraine courts have ruled that the Manafort financial disclosures constituted illegal election meddling.

Ukraine systematically worked behind the scenes to boost Clinton, Politico has reported. On his call with Zelensky in July, Trump specifically asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate reports that Ukraine had some involvement in 2016 election interference, before he mentioned taking a look at Joe Biden's business dealings in the country.

Though multiple reports, including one from The Associated Press, indicated Lutsenko had recanted his claims about Yovanovitch, Lutsenko said he had not -- a revelation later confirmed by The New York Times.

On Friday and beyond, House Republicans plan to sharpen their focus on allegations of Ukraine meddling in the 2016 presidential election, voicing frustration after top diplomats who testified Wednesday said they had no knowledge of the issue. A senior Republican official told Fox News on Thursday that the issue of Ukrainian election meddling would be a “theme” of questions asked by GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee moving forward.

UKRAINE MEDDLING TO BE KEY GOP FOCUS MOVING FORWARD, AFTER WITNESSES APPEARED NOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT

Making matters more complicated for Democrats, Yovanovitch's testimony was set to come just hours after a bombshell report that a top Ukrainian official said Thursday that U.S. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a key Democrat impeachment witness, ""did not link financial military assistance to a request for Ukraine to open up an investigation into former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.""

Citing that report in a tweet late Thursday, Trump called the impeachment probe ""dead.""

Sondland has testified that Trump explicitly told him there were ""no quid pro quos of any kind"" with Ukraine, including one in which military aid would be conditioned on any politically motivated investigations. (Sondland later amended his testimony, claiming his recollection had been ""refreshed,"" to say he had come to ""understand"" from other sources that Trump wanted Ukraine to issue an ""anti-corruption statement."")

Forced out of her job in April, Yovanovitch likely can't offer much of substance on her own about the central allegations against the president. Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry contend that several months later in the year, Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, and withheld U.S. military aid as leverage.

The timeline will render Yovanovitch vulnerable to the same criticisms that Republicans had for William Taylor and George Kent, the two diplomats who testified during Day One of the impeachment proceedings: That all she can offer is unverifiable hearsay and speculation.

WATCH: JIM JORDAN UNLOADS ON 'HEARSAY' TESTIMONY DURING DAY ONE OF IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Additionally, Republican lawmakers have argued that Yovanovitch wasn't entirely truthful in her previous remarks under oath. She communicated via her personal email account with a Democratic congressional staffer concerning a ""quite delicate"" and ""time-sensitive"" matter -- just two days after the whistleblower complaint that kickstarted the impeachment inquiry was filed, and a month before the complaint became public, emails exclusively obtained by Fox News showed.

The emails appear to contradict Yovanovitch's deposition on Capitol Hill last month, in which she told U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., about an email she received Aug. 14 from the staffer, Laura Carey -- but indicated under oath that she never responded to it.

""I specifically asked her whether the Democratic staffer was responded to by Yovanovitch or the State Department,"" Zeldin told Fox News. ""It is greatly concerning that Ambassador Yovanovitch didn't answer my question as honestly as she should have, especially while under oath.""

Yovanovitch's colleagues, for their part, have said she was the target of a smear campaign by the White House, and Trump himself has called the diplomat ""bad news.""

Separately during her remarks, Yovanovitch outlined how she lost her job in Ukraine, even as she remains an employee of the State Department.

“You’re going to think that I’m incredibly naive,” Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators. “But I couldn’t imagine all the things that have happened over the last six or seven months. I just couldn’t imagine it.”

Democratic lawmakers are expected to point to the circumstances of her ouster as they try to make their case that Trump, with the help of his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, mounted an inappropriate pressure campaign to enlist Zelensky in the effort to damage Biden.

“Giuliani also conducted a smear campaign against the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said at the first public impeachment hearing earlier this week. “A senior State Department official told her that although she had done nothing wrong, President Trump had lost confidence in her.”

Trump was convinced Yovanovitch was a rogue actor who held a political bias against him, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 call between the president and Zelensky.

At the time of the call, the Trump administration had put a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and Zelensky and his team were trying to get Trump to commit to a date for a White House meeting.

The intelligence community whistleblower who spurred the House investigation cited Yovanovitch’s ouster as one in a series of events that amounted to an abuse of power by the president.

'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY SAID IN 2017, VOWING IMPEACHMENT

Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday accused the president of ""bribery"" by allegedly ""threatening to withhold military aid"" in exchange for an ""investigation into his political rival"" -- signaling that Democrats were preparing to go all-in on impeachment. The Washington Post had reported Democrats were retiring the ""quid pro quo"" language in exchange for ""bribery"" following an internal study showing the word ""bribery"" resonated more in battleground states.

Yovanovitch, a State Department employee for 33 years who also led U.S. embassies in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, is well known in diplomatic circles for her measured demeanor and diligence in representing both Republican and Democratic administrations, according to former colleagues.

“Mr. Giuliani was almost unmissable starting in mid-March,” Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Wednesday. “As the news campaign, or campaign of slander, against not only Ambassador Yovanovitch unfolded ... he was on TV, his Twitter feed ramped up and it was all focused on Ukraine.”

After the ambassador’s recall, Giuliani told Ukrainian journalists that Yovanovitch was pulled from Kiev because she was part of efforts against the president. The former New York City mayor also has said that he told the president there were concerns among Trump supporters that she had displayed anti-Trump bias in private conversations.

During her October testimony, Yovanovitch said she was told that the State Department had been under pressure from Trump to remove her from Ukraine since the summer of 2018.

FLASHBACK: TRUMP'S NOT ALONE: CONGRESS DIGGING INTO DNC-UKRAINE CONNECTION

In late March, the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., posted a tweet referring to her as a “joker,” and linked to an article from the conservative website Daily Wire that detailed a growing call for Yovanovitch’s ouster.

Yovanovitch raised concerns about the U.S. media reports with Sondland. In response, Sondland encouraged her to tweet her support for Trump on social media.

“He said, ‘You know, you need to go big or go home,'” she recalled. “‘You need to, you know, tweet out there that you support the president.’”

The advice allegedly floored Yovanovitch.

Now Yovanovitch, hardly a marquee name in Washington, finds herself thrust into the spotlight of just the fourth impeachment inquiry in U.S. history.

Nancy McEldowney, a former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria who has known Yovanovitch for three decades, said the accusations levied by Trump and Giuliani don’t square with the professional envoy whose focus throughout her career has remained on “serving American national interests and supporting the people around her.”

Some GOP senators have talked about contingency plans should the House impeach the president. Specifically, Republicans have floated the idea of holding a lengthy Senate trial early next year, which would potentially jam up several Democratic presidential contenders in the middle of the primary season.

House Democrats, however, could preempt that strategy -- perhaps by approving an article of impeachment, then waiting to approve a second resolution formally notifying the Senate of the impeachment until after the primary season is over.

""The rules of impeachment are very clear. We’ll have to have a trial,"" announced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, conceding that the Senate must hold a trial to determine whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office if the Democrat-led House votes to impeach.

What that means for Democratic senators who are also running for president is that they may be forced off the campaign trail to return to Washington D.C. in the critical runup to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries in February 2020.

""That raises a question - who is a trial going to benefit?"" asked Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly [Senate] Republicans are not going to convict the president and yet you're going to have at least six Senate Democratic senators who are running for their nomination, sitting in Washington all through January, enduring this trial.""

""You've got the Iowa [caucuses] coming up the first week of August, followed by New Hampshire, followed by the Nevada caucuses, and then a caucus, a primary in South Carolina,"" he continued. ""In effect, this process of impeachment is suppressing the Democratic message, other than the fact that the message for three years is that they have been chasing the president of the United States.""

In fact, the conundrum for some Democrats is reportedly not lost on the candidates themselves.

The Washington Post reported that ""advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes."" In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., told the Post that a Senate trial would present a serious challenge. “We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to. But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult,” he said.

""So who does [a Senate trial] benefit? Short answer, Pete Buttigieg,"" said Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kyle Peterson. ""He's going to be the only guy in Des Moines. He's going to be walking around, shaking hands, kissing babies and the other Democrats... they're gonna be stuck in Washington, not saying much.""

2020 Democratic national frontrunner Joe Biden will also be free to remain on the campaign trail if the Senate holds a trial. However, recent polling has shown him falling behind his competitors in the early Democratic primary states.

IS IT TOO LATE FOR MORE DEMOCRATS TO JUMP INTO THE 2020 RACE?

""I totally agree,"" said Judith Miller, Fox News contributor and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter. ""It also benefits Mike Bloomberg and the governor of Massachusetts [Deval Patrick], who's now throwing his hat into the ring, maybe.""

Miller concluded by saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., must have foreseen these circumstances.

""I think that was another reason that so troubled Pelosi [by the prospect of impeachment]. She understands the calendar better than anybody - along with votes. And she knew that this was exactly the prospect,"" Miller said. ""If I were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the other Democratic senators who are going to be confined to Washington in this trial, I would be very worried indeed.""

Schiff has pre-scripted a televised production titled “The Impeachment Inquiry Against President Trump.” The story would likely be deemed too absurd and too boring to make it onto the silver screen as a drama, though it might succeed as a comedic farce – too silly to be taken seriously.

Schiff has held closed-door castings, selected the actors and written the 45-minute opening salvo for each act of his work of fiction. Act II was held Friday, as former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before Schiff’s Democratic-controlled committee.

JIM JORDAN ASKS WHY ADAM SCHIFF HASN'T RELEASED TRANSCRIPTS OF 4 CLOSED-DOOR DEPOSITIONS

Unfortunately for Schiff, the American people know a farce when they see it, and his fictional production is collapsing before his very eyes. Though he has carefully orchestrated an attempted coup against the man who 63 million Americans elected as our president, Schiff’s desperate political attack on President Trump has been exposed as nothing more than a witch hunt.

T

he American public recognizes truth versus assumption, presumptions, and the personal opinions of witnesses without firsthand knowledge. Schiff seems to think Americans are stupid and gullible and will think the fairytale he is spinning is real. He is wrong.

The truth is on the side of President Trump. Should Trump-hating House Democrats choose to impeach the president based on no crime, no facts and a whole lot of conjecture, they will pay a hefty price at the ballot box on Nov. 3, 2020.

Americans elected members of Congress to legislate and work to make our country stronger and more prosperous, and to help us build better lives for our families. Sadly, Schiff and his fellow Democrats have abandoned their legislative duties and responsibilities to wage a non-stop smear campaign against President Trump.

Few members of Schiff’s cast of characters who he is calling to testify have firsthand knowledge of the matter at the center of the Democratic impeachment crusade – the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Nor have they spoken with or had any insight into the thought process of President Trump.

The reality – as opposed to the fictional story Schiff is producing – is that there was nothing wrong with the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call. Both presidents have confirmed this. But like all good fiction writers, Schiff won’t let the facts get in the way of his storytelling.

The fact is that just like the rest of the world, Schiff’s star witnesses learned of the content of the Trump-Zelensky call Sept. 25. That was the day when President Trump – in an abundance of unprecedented transparency – chose to release the transcript of his phone call with President Zelensky.

This week’s three impeachment inquiry witnesses – former Ambassador Yovanovitch, acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent – all admitted that they were not on the July 25 phone call and have zero insight into the decision-making of President Trump.

Taylor, the first witness called by Democrats, admitted that he has never so much as met with or even spoken to President Trump. He even went so far as to say that “what I can do here for you today is tell you what I heard from people.” In other words, pass along hearsay.

And, indeed, he did.

In a rather bizarre attempt to provide credence to his sorely lacking theory that aid to Ukraine was tied to that nation investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Taylor offered a new source for his self-described “clear understanding.” The source was a staffer sitting at a table with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland who overheard a phone call between Sondland and President Trump.

That’s right – double hearsay.

In questioning at the Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, dismantled Taylor’s sourcing when he exposed the original basis for Taylor’s pronounced “clear understanding” on the linkage of U.S. aid to Ukraine and that nation’s investigation of the Bidens.

“We’ve got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and you told me that this is where you got your clear understanding?” Jordan asked incredulously. “Your clear understanding is obviously wrong.”

The Democrats’ next witness, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kent, proved to be no more knowledgeable. Like Taylor, he had not spoken to or met with President Trump and had “never in 27 years been on a call made by a president of the United States,” he said. That includes the July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call.

In what has become a clear trend, former Ambassador Yovanovitch – the Democrats’ third witness – was asked point blank Friday: “When did you first learn of the contents of the July 25th call between President Trump and President Zelensky?”

“The day it was made public, like about two weeks ago by the White House,” she replied.

Further, she testified that she “cannot speak for what President Trump thought or what others thought” and had not spoken to President Trump or Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney this year.

That’s right, not a single witness on display this week had so much as met President Trump, spoken with President Trump, or even learned about the contents of the rest of the July 25 phone call until the rest of the public did.

Meanwhile, those who actually have spoken to President Trump have made it clear that there was no quid pro quo.

Former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who has spoken with President Trump, testified in an earlier closed committee session that he had no indication of a quid pro quo – a linkage of a meeting President Zelensky requested with President Trump – to an investigation request.

“I was never asked to do anything that I thought was wrong,” Volker said. The Intelligence Committee released a transcript of his closed-door testimony.

Additionally, Ambassador Sondland testified that the president said: “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.”

Volker, backing up this assertion, testified: “Gordon was repeating here what we all understood.”

And if the hearsay witnesses – Taylor and Yovanovitch in particular – had anything useful to provide us in their testimony, it was their testament to the character of Volker, the exonerating witness.

“In my dealings with Kurt Volker… over the last 30-something years, I consider him to be a man of honor and somebody who’s a brilliant diplomat,” Yovanovitch testified. “And, you know, I think he is working in the interest of our country.”

Echoing this sentiment, William Taylor called Volker a “man of integrity.”

The bottom line is that the witnesses with no direct knowledge of the Trump-Zelensky phone call or President Trump’s decision-making offered little more than hearsay evidence. However, they vouched for the character of the fact witnesses who actually had interactions with President Trump and said that there was no quid pro quo or linkage of aid to a Ukrainian investigation of the Bidens.

On top of this, Ukraine never conducted such an investigation.

If Schiff’s fanciful script was for a movie, the film would be a box office bust and be yanked from theaters after just a couple of days. Unfortunately, Schiff and his fellow Democrats are determined to continue the farcical impeachment witch hunt to smear the president with false accusations, hoping this will hurt his reelection chances.

This blatant partisan political attack is appalling and a tremendous waste of time. But Democrats won’t stop – their severe infection with Trump Derangement Syndrome and their laser-focus on politics over governing won’t let them.

Chirs Murphy",https://www.foxnews.com/media/hunter-joe-biden-ukraine-corruption,"2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, did nothing unethical or illegal with regard to their ties to Ukraine, and are being used as a distraction by President Trump and the GOP, said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., during a Sunday television interview.

Murphy appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" where host Jake Tapper asked if it was appropriate for Hunter Biden to have served as a board member for the Ukranian energy company, Burisma Holdings, which paid him $50,000 a month while his father was vice president.

""Well, I think in an interview Hunter Biden, himself, admitted that he had possibly made a mistake,"" Murphy replied. ""But let’s be clear, Hunter Biden didn’t do anything illegal and his father, the vice president, didn’t do anything illegal or unethical.

""And all of these attacks on the Bidens and the effort to bring the whistleblower in to testify are just an attempt to try to put more chum in the water and distract from the corrupt scheme that is at heart of this inquiry.""

SEN. CHRIS MURPHY ACCUSES SEN. RON JOHNSON OF GIVING TRUMP 'GREEN LIGHT' TO 'SOLICIT FOREIGN INTERFERENCE'

Murphy claimed congressional impeachment hearings have already revealed the president's crimes and declared him guilty of extortion and election interference.

""It’s now absolutely clear what happened,"" he said earlier in the segment. ""The president was using taxpayer dollars, security aid to Ukraine, and a White House meeting in order to extort the Ukrainian president into trying to interfere in the 2020 election, and trying to help the president destroy the Bidens and the Clintons.""

Murphy also accused the White House of violating the law to prevent potential witnesses from testifying and said those who received direct orders from the president are being hidden from Congress.

""The White House is going to rely on this idea that the people who were getting the direct orders from the president... are largely not testifying before the committee,"" he said. ""There’s a reason for that. The White House isn’t allowing them to testify... The White House is violating the law in keeping them from the impeachment inquiry.

""Why? Because they know that those are the individuals who were actually getting most of the direct orders from the president and they don’t want that to be on the record,"" Murphy continued. ""So the White House can’t have it both ways."""

The three House committees overseeing the impeachment inquiry against Trump released hundreds of pages of closed-door testimony by Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to Pence on Europe and Russia, and Tim Morrison, the former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council. Morrison was interviewed Oct. 31 and Williams was interviewed Nov. 7.

Both Williams and Morrison were listening in on the July 25 phone call, which was flagged by an intelligence community whistleblower and has become the center of the impeachment inquiry. House Democrats say that aid was withheld from Ukraine until its government launched investigations into Biden, his son Hunter and their dealings in the eastern European county -- particularly the younger Biden's work with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.

Investigators also met Saturday with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official Mark Sandy, who was involved in key meetings about the nearly $400 million aid package Congress had approved for Ukraine.

Williams told lawmakers that the word ""Burisma"" appeared in her notes of the July 25 call, though it did not appear in the memorandum of the conversation released by the White House in September. The transcript indicates that Williams initially told lawmakers that Trump mentioned Burisma to Zelensky, but a letter from her attorney following the deposition states that Williams' ""recollection had been incorrect"" and Zelensky mentioned Burisma to Trump.

For his part, Morrison that he consulted NSC lawyers following the July 25 call because he was worried about details of the conversation being leaked to the media, according to transcripts of his testimony released Saturday.

In his testimony, Morrison said he asked NSC Legal Adviser John Eisenberg and Eisenberg's deputy, Michael Ellis, to review the July 25 call ""because I was concerned about whether or not they would agree that it would be damaging ... if the call package, if the call mem-con [memorandum of conversation] or its contents leaked.""

During the call itself, Morrison said he was concerned by how ""obsequious"" Zelensky sounded toward Trump and added that the conversation ""was not the full-throated endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda that I was hoping to hear.""

Morrison added that he and Eisenberg agreed that access to the call should be restricted, but then claimed Eisbenberg later told him that he did not intend for the call summary to be placed on a highly classified server. According to Morrison, Eisenberg's staff apparently put it there by mistake and nothing in the call's contents warranted placement on the classified server.

Morrison also told House investigators that Fiona Hill, a top NSC expert on Russia, had described U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland ""as a problem"" who ""believed he had the mandate to get involved [in Ukraine policy] based on his relationship with"" Trump, even though Ukraine is not a member of the EU.

""We [Morrison and Hill] both discussed that Ukraine was not in the EU, which led to the follow-on question of, why is he involved in Ukraine?"" said Morrison of Sondland, who is expected to testify publicly on Wednesday. Morrison, who is set to publicly testify Tuesday, added that he became concerned while listening to the July 25 phone call that Hill's fear that Sondland was involved in a ""parallel process"" of making Ukraine policy was true.

Weeks after the July 25 call, on Sept. 1, Sondland held a conversation with a top Zelensky aide, Andriy Yermak, on the sidelines of a summit between Pence and Zelensky in Warsaw.

Morrison said he witnessed the exchange and that afterward Sondland bounded across the room to tell him what was said. Sondland told him that ""what could help them move the aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation,"" Morrison testified.

""My concern was what Gordon was proposing about getting the Ukrainians pulled into our politics,"" Morrison said. He added: ""It was the first time something like this had been injected as a condition on the release of the assistance.""

A few days later, on Sept. 7, Morrison told investigators that Sondland ""related that both -- the president [Trump] said there was not a quid pro quo, but he [Trump] further stated that President Zelensky should want to go to the microphone and announce personally -- so it wouldn't be enough fon the prosecutor general, he wanted to announce personally, Zelensky personally, that he would open the investigations.""

While some, including Trump himself, have begun to question Sondland's knowledge of events, Morrison said the ambassador ""related to me he was acting -- he was discussing these matters with the President.""

As Sondland, Giuliani and others tried to persuade Zelensky to launch the investigations Trump wanted of his Democratic rivals, Morrison said he ""tried to stay away.""

""The testimony released today shows that President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky immediately set off alarm bells throughout the White House,"" Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Oversight Committee Acting Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel said in a joint statement. ""Both witnesses provided the Committees with first-hand accounts after personally listening to the call in the White House Situation Room ... We look forward to the public testimony of both officials.""

A senior administration official, meanwhile, lashed out at House Democrats in response to reports that they had changed their terminology to describe the allegations against Trump in response to polling data.

""The only reaction coming from House Democrats, who continue to use PR firms and DCCC polling data to push their conspiracy theories as facts, seems to be that of disappointment. Everything so far is about the temperature of the room, and that the testimony was 'technical' and didn’t get them what they wanted,"" the official said. ""It’s looking like Democrats are now desperate to sell any narrative that’ll justify what most Americans recognize has been an extreme abuse of Congress’ powers. At this point, their fishing expedition would probably even find George Washington guilty of treason.""

The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Buttigieg with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

Warren's support has dropped six percentage points from the September CNN/DMR/Mediacom poll, while Biden's backing has slipped five percentage points. Sanders' support has risen four percentage points from two months ago.

FOX NEWS POLL: CLOSE RACES BETWEEN TRUMP AND DEMOCRATS IN NORTH CAROLINA

No one else in the poll cracked double-digit support. In fifth place, behind Sanders, is Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who earned six percent of the vote.

""This @DMRegister poll confirms what we’re seeing every day — MOMENTUM!"" Klobuchar tweeted Saturday night. ""

Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J.; Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii; businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang are all tied at three percent. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has not formally announced his candidacy, earned two percent.

Buttigieg has moved to the front of the pack in other recent polls of Iowa. A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday pegged Buttigieg at 22 percent, Biden at 19 percent, Warren at 18 percent and Sanders at 13 percent. Buttigieg's support jumped 14 percentage points compared to Monmouth’s last survey in August, while Biden’s dropped seven percentage points, Warren’s edged down two percentage points, and Sanders jumped five percentage points from the August survey.

A Quinnipiac survey released last week however had Buttigieg one point behind Warren, at 19 and 20 percentage points respectively.

BUTTIGIEG CLAIMS NARROW IOWA LEAD AMID PRIMARY SURGE: POLL

Buttigieg is a 37-year-old Navy war veteran and would be America’s first openly gay president if elected. Without any sort of Washington name-recognition, the mayor’s campaign seemed a longshot before he rose to middle-tier status in the spring.

Buttigieg for many seems to offer a more moderate approach than the radical policy proposals of Warren and Sanders, and unlike Biden, he does not have to fight many concerns about his age or past voting record. Among Iowa caucusgoers, 63 percent say Buttigieg's views are about right, while only seven percent say they are too liberal and 13 percent say they are too conservative.

According to the CNN/DMR poll, Buttigieg excels with caucusgoers with incomes over $100,000 (32 percent) and self-described moderates (also 32 percent) but underperforms with union households (17 percent) and those who call themselves very liberal (12 percent)."

The networks are always and forever going to try to beat this president senseless with negative coverage.

It's out of control.

The latest study by the Media Research Center's Rich Noyes finds that during the six weeks since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the inquiry (Sept. 24 through Nov. 5), ""the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts churned out 398 minutes of coverage to the Ukraine scandal."" Important, yes, but it's ""more than three-fifths of all administration news during this period."" It neatly resembles their fiendish obsession with their last ""fake news"" chapter: Trump and Russia.

JASON CHAFFETZ: WHY SCHIFF'S WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS AT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE

Here's what's truly amazing. The tone of overall coverage was 96 percent negative. That makes the long-running average of 90 percent look good.

The negativity is both bombastic and shameless. On Oct. 29, ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell touted ""bombshell impeachment testimony"" in her opening tease and then turned to the first report. ""We're going to begin with that damning impeachment testimony today from a key witness,"" she said.

The same night, NBC chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson also enthusiastically promoted ""bombshell testimony"" from ""a firsthand witness to the explosive conversation that ignited the impeachment inquiry.""

This allegedly dynamite testimony was behind closed doors, and there was no audio or video, but the networks sold it anyway.

The Media Research Center also reports that Joe Biden bizarrely received the best press of his campaign (71 percent positive), as reporters robotically repeated the mantra that ""there is no evidence of any wrongdoing"" by Biden or his profiteering son Hunter Biden in Ukraine. Trump bad, Bidens good.

And they have no interest in pursuing the one question Republicans keep asking: What did Hunter Biden do in return for 50 grand per month?

These networks can't find time for any good news for this president, or for the country. Despite a 50-year low in the unemployment rate and record stock market highs, Trump's handling of the economy was almost completely squashed. Facts about the booming economy drew just 4 minutes and 6 seconds of coverage during these six weeks. That's less than 1 percent of all news on the Trump administration.

Here's the one that puts everything in its proper perspective. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was the world's most dangerous terrorist -- was. The U.S. commander in chief took him out. How did the media cover his role in it? The tone was 67 percent negative! They criticized him for anything they could find, from his refusal to brief congressional leaders to his swaggering commentary on how this foul terrorist died disgracefully by blowing himself up.

NBC News correspondent Courtney Kube speculated and said, ""It's possible that President Trump's bellicose language about the manner in which he died could actually inspire some ISIS fighters to retaliate."" And it's possible that NBC's perennially bellicose language against the Republicans could backfire.

So, let's repeat. The economy is going gangbusters. We beheaded the leadership of ISIS. And President Trump's overall evening-news coverage was 96 percent negative. How can they look into the teleprompters with a straight face?

And now Harris may be facing another problem: A second report Friday described internal strife at Harris’ Baltimore campaign headquarters, with several aides calling for campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s resignation following his late October decision to lay off field staffers in several states and dedicate Harris' already dwindling campaign war chest to a seven-figure TV ad campaign before the February Iowa caucus.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE'S 'ALL IN' ON IOWA -- DESPITE CAMPAIGN RESTRUCTURING, LAYOFFS

Harris and Bloomberg were deadlocked in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Nov. 12-14. Though not yet a declared candidate, Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul, launched a massive $100 million digital ad campaign Friday targeting President Trump.

In the poll, both Harris and Bloomberg fell behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who polled at 6 percent, and Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who polled at 13 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led the Demicratic field tied at 19 percent support.

Rodriguez said in an Oct. 30 campaign memo obtained by Fox News that several dozen people would be laid off at the campaign's Baltimore headquarters -- as would volunteers in New Hampshire, Nevada, and California -- in an effort to go ""all-in"" in Iowa. He also said the campaign aimed to dedicate $1 million to a media campaign in the weeks before the Feb. 3 caucus, a figure now considered unlikely given Harris’ lackluster funding.

Three additional staff members were laid off and another quit in recent days at Harris’ campaign headquarters in Baltimore, unnamed aides told Politico on Friday. They said several aides have approached campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, to force Rodriguez to step down, claiming his failed leadership is responsible for the campaign’s recent troubles.

One official said Harris’ current campaign structure has “No discipline. No plan. No strategy.”

“It’s a campaign of id,” the official continued. “What feels right, what impulse you have right now, what emotion, what frustration.”

But others defended Rodriguez, saying he’s been loyal to Harris even before she first announced her candidacy in January. They pointed fingers at Maya Harris, who shared leadership responsibility with Rodriguez.

“From the outset of this race, he has had all the responsibility with none of the authority. He’s been managing this race with at least one, if not two, hands tied behind his back,” a senior campaign official told Politico of Rodriguez. “He would never undermine her. He’s just not that guy.”

The Politico report cited 12 individuals – who were either current or former campaign staffers or donors – who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, Harris has been crisscrossing the country to try to salvage support. Her campaign has struggled to regain traction after an initial stand-out moment in the race during the first Democratic debate in June when she challenged Biden, a frontrunner, over comments he made about segregationist U.S. senators and school busing. Harris struggled in the second debate after Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, challenged her record as California's attorney general. She struggled to shine in subsequent debates.

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends: Weekend,"" Bongino said Democrats don't have a leg to stand on and that the whistleblower was factually incorrect.

In an exclusive interview Friday on ""The Dan Bongino Show,"" the president sounded off on the impeachment inquiry, saying ""everybody knows who the whistleblower is"" and the person ""has to be revealed.""

ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR ACCUSES LEFT OF SYSTEMIC 'SABOTAGE' OF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

""The whistleblower wrote a report which was mostly on the phone call that everybody now sees was a good call,"" Trump said. ""So, fortunately, the call was transcribed by experts and transcribed beautifully. And that was the call when they saw it, when I released it. Then everything started going downhill.""

""It was a great interview,"" Bongino told ""Fox & Friends"" hosts Ed Henry, Lisa Boothe and Pete Hegseth. ""I'll tell you, it was going on during Ambassador Yovanovitch's testimony. And the president was, I think rightfully so, furious about what's going on.""

On Friday former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified in a public hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. She said she was ousted after a smear campaign led by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was trying to get dirt on the president's Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.

But Yovanovitch could not supply the panel with information regarding any criminal activity or bribes involving Trump.

Bongino said he believes the president is so angry about the impeachment inquiry ""because he really genuinely feels -- and I wholeheartedly agree based on actual evidence what Democrats don't have -- that he didn't do anything wrong.""

""So, he's furious about it, and I don't blame him for wanting to find out how the whistleblower got this thing so wrong,"" Bongino said.

Yovanovitch was the third witness in the formal inquiry to testify publicly. Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, and senior State Department official George Kent testified Wednesday.

""Do you realize there are three ringer witnesses -- Kent, Taylor, and Yovanovitch -- not one of them has any evidence of a crime?"" Bongino questioned.

""What are we doing here? Why are we wasting America's time?"" he asked."

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends: Weekend"" with hosts Ed Henry and Lisa Boothe on Saturday, Senior Legal Adviser for Trump 2020 Campaign Jenna Ellis Rives said what the American people saw in the impeachment hearings ""is that the Democrats actually have zero evidence.""

Rives said, ""What we have right now is the burden of proof on the Democrats and they can't show it.""

The Democrats' probe was initiated after a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general about the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy.

CHRIS STEWART TAKEDOWN OF YOVANOVITCH SHOWS DEMOCRATS HAVE 'NO CASE,' GOP SAYS

On the call, Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into Ukrainian election meddling in the 2016 presidential race and into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

Zelensky, though, has said he felt no pressure during the call. The White House has maintained no wrongdoing, and the president has repeatedly said the call was “perfect,” arguing that it contained “no quid pro quo.”

Within the last week, Democrats have notably shifted their rhetoric to accusing the president of bribery instead of quid pro quo.

Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett said, ""Bribery is nothing more than a quid pro quo -- an exchange of benefits. But, if the recipient of the quid is oblivious to the quo, it's a legal impossibility for there to be a quid pro quo.""

He said that Democrats are looking for ""any excuse, any pretext, to impeach the president"" because ""they are driven by hatred or bias.""

Former Chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee Jason Chaffetz added that he believes the ""evidence is that Donald Trump was much tougher on Russia than Barack Obama was.""

He told the hosts the investigation was all ""just a charade"" the Democrats were perpetuating and that he had wished Republicans had moved to adjourn the hearing after Yovanovitch told Rep. Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, that she could supply the panel with no information regarding criminal activity or bribes that President Trump may have been involved with.

""Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the president of the United States has been involved with at all?"" asked Stewart.

""No,"" Yovanovitch said.

""The American people know this is nonsense,"" Stewart added. ""The American people know this is unfair.""

""It's a complete sham,"" Rives concluded. ""This is just a political maneuver in the court of public opinion to take out a duly elected president.""

We need to settle back in our seats because neither side is giving an inch.

Did the Democrats strengthen their case against President Trump? Who were the winners and losers? Did former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch have it right when she testified Friday that she can’t say if President Trump bribed anyone or committed a crime?

Time will tell, but here are my seven takeaways and some winners and losers from the first week of public impeachment hearings, held Wednesday and Friday.

ADAM SCHIFF TO TRUMP IN IMPEACHMENT HEARING: 'STOP OBSTRUCTING'

The stock market doesn’t care

All of the U.S. stock exchanges are at or near all-time highs. Could it be that the bull market assumes that the impeachment hearings will amount to nothing? Or that investors know Trump is not going to be removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate, and therefore there is no threat to the markets in the year ahead? It would seem so.

The hearings are a political TV show

The Watergate hearings considering the impeachment of President Richard Nixon truly uncovered facts. The House Intelligence Committee hearings chaired by Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., now underway are not fact-finding hearings.

All of the witnesses that Schiff has called or will be calling to testify have had their depositions taken. That means the Democrats already know exactly what their witnesses will say in advance of the public hearing.

As a result, Democrats have scripted their leading questions to score political points – not to uncover facts. Republicans are also able to undertake cross-examination based on what they already know.

This is not an inquiry. This is a made-for-TV political event.

Most Americans don’t find the hearings all that interesting

To their credit, the cable TV news networks are providing full coverage of the hearings. Americans have full access, yet the ratings so far are lower than the congressional hearings for former FBI Director James Comey in 2017 and now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year.

Does that mean that public interest in impeachment is lukewarm? That the public doesn’t trust the impeachment process? Or that most people already have their minds made up on whether Trump should be impeached, as 70 percent said in a recent poll? Or does it mean that most Americans are getting tired of Washington political battles?

Frankly, it is likely all four. Regardless of the exact reason, lukewarm ratings aren’t indicative of a coming rise in support for impeachment.

Do policy differences warrant impeachment?

Three State Department officials have testified so far. A huge percentage of their testimony has been about their opinions and feelings about the Trump administration’s foreign policy goals and conduct. Since when are policy differences the basis of impeachment?

New facts not coming out

There are not many facts in play. If there were, why would Yovanovitch have no information on the call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that prompted the impeachment inquiry, or events thereafter? Why were the first two witnesses “hearsay” witnesses who were barely involved?

Devoid of new facts, the Democrats sought Friday to portray President Trump as a bad guy who was grossly unfair to ambassadors. Is that impeachable?

The imperial Schiff

The late Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., only reluctantly oversaw impeachment proceedings against President Nixon in the House. In contrast, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff has been going after President Trump for the past two years.

Schiff has lied about the facts related to the Trump-Russia collusion investigation and lied about his panel’s contacts with the whistleblower regarding the Trump-Zelensky call on Ukraine. Now he has designated himself the inquisitor in chief in the Trump impeachment inquiry.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Schiff and the partisan counsel for the committee, who pushed the Steele dossier and the lies about Trump’s conduct, have repeatedly asked leading questions chock-full of “facts not in evidence.”

Yet, Schiff warned witnesses this week not to answer Republican questions that included “facts not in evidence.” Meanwhile, he continues to block the testimony of the whistleblower and refuses to give Republicans the transcripts of certain witnesses.

In short, Schiff is running an unfair hearing. Don’t expect that to change as he continues to deny Republicans the right to call certain witnesses, including the so-called whistleblower, despite the assurances of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Schiff that the whistleblower would be a witness.

More proof that this is a staged event – not an actual inquiry.

A political brawl

Given all of that, and the last three years of attacks on President Trump, can anyone be surprised that the president tweeted and spoke poorly of a witness – former Ambassador Yovanovitch?

Always remember that President Bill Clinton and his team relentlessly attacked witnesses and Independent Counsel Ken Starr in the Clinton impeachment – including two women who made sexual misconduct accusations against Clinton.

As for the current impeachment hearings, they are designed to politically wound President Trump at the least – and at most remove him from office. From all we know of Donald Trump, you could well expect more of punching back from this President – all to the delight of his supporters and to the benefit of his fundraising.

Winners & Losers

Winner: Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., for standing up to Schiff on the Intelligence Committee. She wouldn’t be silenced by Schiff and read old tweets from him in which he said the Ukraine whistleblower would testify before the committee – a position Schiff now rejects. Republicans have found a young star. The Democrats must be worried about Stefanik because they are already attacking her.

Loser: Democratic presidential hopefuls. They are all being pushed off the front page because of impeachment coverage, and those serving in the Senate will be sidelined attending Trump’s Senate trial if he is impeached in the House.

Winner: Ukraine. It is getting so much attention that it must seem to be the center of the world for many TV viewers.

Loser::Former Vice President Joe Biden. The witnesses have made clear that Ukraine is a swamp and that his son was highly paid to serve on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. This was – at the very least – a conflict of interest. Every day Biden is tied to Ukraine is not a good day for his already sliding campaign.

Loser. Due process. In the context of these hearings, that assumes equal treatment, reciprocally applied. That is not happening and apparently will not happen. That is the worst thing of all for everyone.

“The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that,” Obama said.

OBAMA SOUNDS OFF ON CANCEL CULTURE, 'WOKE' PURITY: 'THAT'S NOT ACTIVISM'

“There are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don't want to see crazy stuff,"" he said. ""They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.”

The two-term Democratic president made the remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race last year.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines on the 2020 Democratic primary, and has not yet backed a candidate -- even as former Vice President Joe Biden has invoked his name on numerous occasions. But Obama has made remarks indicating he is nervous about the drift to the extreme left on a number of issues by parts of the Democratic Party.

On Friday, he did not mention any candidates by name, but did cite immigration and health care reform as examples of where Democrats may be out of sync with the broader electorate.

Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who have both released plans on immigration and “Medicare-for-all” respectively in recent weeks. Warren’s government-led overhaul of the health care system would eventually abolish private insurance and cost $52 trillion, while Sanders’ immigration plan includes radical policies including welfare for illegal immigrants and a moratorium on all deportations.

SANDERS' IMMIGRATION PLAN: HALT DEPORTATIONS, ABOLISH ICE, WELCOME 50K 'CLIMATE MIGRANTS,' GIVE WELFARE TO ALL

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The comment about Twitter feeds echoes remarks he made last month, when the former president took a swipe at “woke” virtue signalling and cancel culture, telling a Chicago audience to “get over” their obsessions with ideological purity tests.

Schiff has pre-scripted a televised production titled “The Impeachment Inquiry Against President Trump.” The story would likely be deemed too absurd and too boring to make it onto the silver screen as a drama, though it might succeed as a comedic farce – too silly to be taken seriously.

Schiff has held closed-door castings, selected the actors and written the 45-minute opening salvo for each act of his work of fiction. Act II was held Friday, as former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before Schiff’s Democratic-controlled committee.

JIM JORDAN ASKS WHY ADAM SCHIFF HASN'T RELEASED TRANSCRIPTS OF 4 CLOSED-DOOR DEPOSITIONS

Unfortunately for Schiff, the American people know a farce when they see it, and his fictional production is collapsing before his very eyes. Though he has carefully orchestrated an attempted coup against the man who 63 million Americans elected as our president, Schiff’s desperate political attack on President Trump has been exposed as nothing more than a witch hunt.

T

he American public recognizes truth versus assumption, presumptions, and the personal opinions of witnesses without firsthand knowledge. Schiff seems to think Americans are stupid and gullible and will think the fairytale he is spinning is real. He is wrong.

The truth is on the side of President Trump. Should Trump-hating House Democrats choose to impeach the president based on no crime, no facts and a whole lot of conjecture, they will pay a hefty price at the ballot box on Nov. 3, 2020.

Americans elected members of Congress to legislate and work to make our country stronger and more prosperous, and to help us build better lives for our families. Sadly, Schiff and his fellow Democrats have abandoned their legislative duties and responsibilities to wage a non-stop smear campaign against President Trump.

Few members of Schiff’s cast of characters who he is calling to testify have firsthand knowledge of the matter at the center of the Democratic impeachment crusade – the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Nor have they spoken with or had any insight into the thought process of President Trump.

The reality – as opposed to the fictional story Schiff is producing – is that there was nothing wrong with the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call. Both presidents have confirmed this. But like all good fiction writers, Schiff won’t let the facts get in the way of his storytelling.

The fact is that just like the rest of the world, Schiff’s star witnesses learned of the content of the Trump-Zelensky call Sept. 25. That was the day when President Trump – in an abundance of unprecedented transparency – chose to release the transcript of his phone call with President Zelensky.

This week’s three impeachment inquiry witnesses – former Ambassador Yovanovitch, acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent – all admitted that they were not on the July 25 phone call and have zero insight into the decision-making of President Trump.

Taylor, the first witness called by Democrats, admitted that he has never so much as met with or even spoken to President Trump. He even went so far as to say that “what I can do here for you today is tell you what I heard from people.” In other words, pass along hearsay.

And, indeed, he did.

In a rather bizarre attempt to provide credence to his sorely lacking theory that aid to Ukraine was tied to that nation investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Taylor offered a new source for his self-described “clear understanding.” The source was a staffer sitting at a table with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland who overheard a phone call between Sondland and President Trump.

That’s right – double hearsay.

In questioning at the Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, dismantled Taylor’s sourcing when he exposed the original basis for Taylor’s pronounced “clear understanding” on the linkage of U.S. aid to Ukraine and that nation’s investigation of the Bidens.

“We’ve got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and you told me that this is where you got your clear understanding?” Jordan asked incredulously. “Your clear understanding is obviously wrong.”

The Democrats’ next witness, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kent, proved to be no more knowledgeable. Like Taylor, he had not spoken to or met with President Trump and had “never in 27 years been on a call made by a president of the United States,” he said. That includes the July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call.

In what has become a clear trend, former Ambassador Yovanovitch – the Democrats’ third witness – was asked point blank Friday: “When did you first learn of the contents of the July 25th call between President Trump and President Zelensky?”

“The day it was made public, like about two weeks ago by the White House,” she replied.

Further, she testified that she “cannot speak for what President Trump thought or what others thought” and had not spoken to President Trump or Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney this year.

That’s right, not a single witness on display this week had so much as met President Trump, spoken with President Trump, or even learned about the contents of the rest of the July 25 phone call until the rest of the public did.

Meanwhile, those who actually have spoken to President Trump have made it clear that there was no quid pro quo.

Former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who has spoken with President Trump, testified in an earlier closed committee session that he had no indication of a quid pro quo – a linkage of a meeting President Zelensky requested with President Trump – to an investigation request.

“I was never asked to do anything that I thought was wrong,” Volker said. The Intelligence Committee released a transcript of his closed-door testimony.

Additionally, Ambassador Sondland testified that the president said: “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.”

Volker, backing up this assertion, testified: “Gordon was repeating here what we all understood.”

And if the hearsay witnesses – Taylor and Yovanovitch in particular – had anything useful to provide us in their testimony, it was their testament to the character of Volker, the exonerating witness.

“In my dealings with Kurt Volker… over the last 30-something years, I consider him to be a man of honor and somebody who’s a brilliant diplomat,” Yovanovitch testified. “And, you know, I think he is working in the interest of our country.”

Echoing this sentiment, William Taylor called Volker a “man of integrity.”

The bottom line is that the witnesses with no direct knowledge of the Trump-Zelensky phone call or President Trump’s decision-making offered little more than hearsay evidence. However, they vouched for the character of the fact witnesses who actually had interactions with President Trump and said that there was no quid pro quo or linkage of aid to a Ukrainian investigation of the Bidens.

On top of this, Ukraine never conducted such an investigation.

If Schiff’s fanciful script was for a movie, the film would be a box office bust and be yanked from theaters after just a couple of days. Unfortunately, Schiff and his fellow Democrats are determined to continue the farcical impeachment witch hunt to smear the president with false accusations, hoping this will hurt his reelection chances.

This blatant partisan political attack is appalling and a tremendous waste of time. But Democrats won’t stop – their severe infection with Trump Derangement Syndrome and their laser-focus on politics over governing won’t let them.

""Well, I think in an interview Hunter Biden, himself, admitted that he had possibly made a mistake,"" Murphy replied. ""But let’s be clear, Hunter Biden didn’t do anything illegal and his father, the vice president, didn’t do anything illegal or unethical.

Murphy claimed congressional impeachment hearings have already revealed the president's crimes and declared him guilty of extortion and election interference.

""It’s now absolutely clear what happened,"" he said earlier in the segment. ""The president was using taxpayer dollars, security aid to Ukraine, and a White House meeting in order to extort the Ukrainian president into trying to interfere in the 2020 election, and trying to help the president destroy the Bidens and the Clintons.""

Murphy also accused the White House of violating the law to prevent potential witnesses from testifying and said those who received direct orders from the president are being hidden from Congress.

""There’s a reason for that. The White House isn’t allowing them to testify... The White House is violating the law in keeping them from the impeachment inquiry.

""Why? Because they know that those are the individuals who were actually getting most of the direct orders from the president and they don’t want that to be on the record,"" Murphy continued. ""So the White House can’t have it both ways."""

“Unlike tight races in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina has a clear front-runner in the Democratic primary,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said. “Former Vice President Joe Biden has broad based appeal, with particularly strong leads among black and moderate/conservative voters.”

Hedge-fund manager turned billionaire environment and progressive grassroots advocate Tom Steyer stands at 5 percent in the poll, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 2 percent. Everyone else in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registers at 1 percent or less.

Among black voters – a majority of Democratic presidential primary voters in South Carolina – Biden stands at 44 percent. Sanders, the Vermont senator, is second at 10 percent, with everyone else registering in single digits.

THE LATEST 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN POLLS FROM FOX NEWS

The poll indicates Biden’s the most favorably viewed of all the candidates, with a 71 percent-18 percent favorable-unfavorable rating. The former vice president’s plus-53 net favorability rating is 17 points higher than Sanders and 22 points higher than Warren.

The poll’s release comes days after former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick jumped into the race, and amid speculation that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is poised to launch a presidential bid.

Snow noted that Patrick “has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him.”

“More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough -- but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably,"" she added.

And Snow pointed out that “where South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.”

But fellow Democrats seem to be hinting his stand againt legalizing marijuana may be outdated too.

The latest pushback came Sunday night, when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted that “Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health.”

AOC's Twitter post -- which mirrored the pro-pot stands of Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom she supports for president, as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and others running for the party's 2020 nomination -- came a day after Biden told a town hall audience in Las Vegas that he still hasn’t seen enough evidence that marijuana is not a gateway drug, so he can't yet back legalizing weed.

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally,"" Biden said, according to Business Insider. ""I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.""

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it."" — Joe Biden

Sanders said Oct. 24 he would legalize the drug by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House, Fox News reported.



SANDERS INTRODUCES PLAN TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA NATIONWIDE DURING FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE



Last year, Sanders' home state of Vermont legalized possession of one ounce of pot and letting each adult resident grow two plants for personal use. He has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide and argued criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.



""Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Biden, however, spoke in favor of a more cautious approach. He said states should be able to legalize marijuana if they want but added he wouldn’t overturn federal law right away.



In addition, he supports medical marijuana and believes possession of the substance ""should not be a crime,"" the Business Insider report said.



Much of Biden’s 40-year Senate career took place during the federal government's War on Drugs, which included harsh criminal penalties for nonviolent drug users, Business Insider reported.



The former vice president also said in a June campaign speech that he supported expunging past convictions for possession.

But contrary to Biden's Las Vegas comments, several national organizations say there is no solid evidence to support the claim that using marijuana leads to the use of harder drugs, the report said. A 1999 Institute of Medicine report said marijuana ""typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use,"" but it ""does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse; that is, care must be taken not to attribute cause to association.""



The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that research shows ""the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, 'harder' substances,"" and drug use can be affected by numerous other biological and environmental factors, the report continued.



The majority of current candidates openly support nationwide legalization.



Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, with only nine states where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent Gallup poll found 66 percent of Americans support fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.



The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.



While Sanders became the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates Warren and Booker as well as Sen. Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records."

He said the former vice president doesn't believe his own words.

Lorance served six years of a 19-year sentence for second-degree murder after he ordered soldiers to open fire on three motorcycle riders in Afghanistan in 2012. Several of his platoon members later testified against him before he was convicted. The president took an interest in Lorance's case, but Biden claimed Trump violated the law when he issued the pardon.

""Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional & the men and women who wear the uniform honorably,"" Biden tweeted Sunday. ""He is not fit to command our troops.""

""With all due respect to the former vice president, that seems to be a partisan answer,"" he said. ""That seems to be something that he's just toeing the party line on.

But lost in much of the coverage of the dramatic hearings is what this Ukrainian natural gas firm actually does and the controversy it's generated in the past -- beyond the now well-known fact that Hunter Biden served on its board, thus arousing the suspicion of the Trump White House and touching off the series of events leading to impeachment proceedings.

TENSIONS BOIL OVER AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING, AS NUNES ACCUSES SCHIFF OF 'GAGGING' LAWMAKERS

While both sides of the aisle fiercely debate the propriety of the younger Biden's role, the company itself has long been tied to controversy.

“Burisma’s reputation in Ukraine is low, and was dubious before (the impeachment inquiry) due to the scandals surrounding the owner,” Igor Egorov, the president of the Kiev-based nonprofit Anticorruption Entrepreneurial Front, told Fox News, underscoring that it hasn’t stopped the company from financial growth.

“Burisma is among the top five oil, drilling, and production companies and planned to drill 21 new wells in 2019, expanding its production capabilities,"" Egorov said. ""Burisma Holdings controls many companies in the oil & gas industry – the group was successful due to relations with authorities.”

The White House embroilment unraveled in late September following a whistleblower complaint, which raised alarms that Trump may have withheld military aid to Ukraine in pressuring the newly elected Volodymyr Zelensky government to investigate Hunter Biden’s recent role as a Burisma board member.

Hunter Biden joined the board after being discharged from the Navy Reserve for drug use, at a time when Burisma was engulfed in corruption investigation woes, and at a time when his father Joe Biden as vice president was leading the Obama administration’s effort to curb Ukraine’s endemic corruption. He stepped down in April when Biden announced his 2020 presidential aspirations.

Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have repeatedly made the accusation that Biden inappropriately leveraged his White House position to have Viktor Shokin, then Ukraine's leading prosecutor, fired in March 2016 to avoid implicating Hunter in corruption investigations. Joe Biden's campaign has vigorously disputed this -- saying he urged the firing for the exact opposite reason: Shokin wasn’t doing enough.

Nonetheless, Burisma is on the Washington map amid the cloud of controversy.

“Burisma is better known in the U.S. than in Ukraine,” said Alexander Paraschiy, the head of research at Kiev-based investment firm, Concorde Capital. “Experts know that the company belongs to former minister of Yanukovych government, and taking into account that Yanukovych has a poor reputation, so [does founder Mykola] Zlochevsky.”

So who did Hunter Biden serve during his lucrative position earning upwards of $50,000 per month?

Burisma was founded in 2002 by oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, who was closely aligned to the now-exiled former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Zlochevsky served as the minister of ecology and natural resources from July 2010 until April 2012 and then as deputy secretary for economic and social security until February 2014 when the notoriously pro-Russian Yanukovych was forced to flee to Moscow.

Soon after, Zlochevsky himself absconded when Ukraine’s prosecutor general put him on the country’s watch list and opened numerous probes into his practices and multitude of businesses, flanked by allegations of money laundering and tax evasion. Moreover, questions have long swirled as to how he granted licenses for the development of mineral deposit extraction during his government post.

“[Zlochevsky] was suspected of violations while providing gas production licenses and permits to his own companies,” Paraschiy explained, emphasizing that even after Biden’s tenure on the board, he “doubted that the image has changed.”

Ukrainian records, according to The Wall Street Journal, show that Burisma’s two main subsidiaries were awarded their exploration permits during Zlochevsky’s official reign. His assets were frozen in the U.K, but citing a lack of evidence produced by the Serious Fraud Office, the Central Criminal Court in London later discharged the order.

Nonetheless, Burisma’s website touts that it is the “first, and only fully integrated gas operator in Ukraine engaged in the exploration, production, processing, transportation and final sale of hydrocarbons” and has 35 licenses in all major basins in Ukraine, and paid some $24.6 million in taxes over the past two years. It has also, using Hunter Biden’s image, promoted its desire to expand outside Ukraine.

Burisma Holdings did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

While its owner is known for a high-flying lifestyle of luxury cars and excessive residences, Burisma operates in the quiet, non-descript shadows and only lists an address in Cyprus, where the company is registered.

According to Christopher Hartwell, current fellow and former president of the Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE) in Warsaw, registering in Cyprus is a common tactic of post-Soviet oligarchs.

“As Cyprus has some fantastic offshore tax benefits. It is the reason why Cyprus shows such high levels of foreign direct investment, which are really just piles of money passing through,” he explained. “It could be done to minimize tax liability, it could be done to access the European Union, or it could be done for money laundering. These are the top three reasons why Slavic companies register in Cyprus.”

Ukraine analysts also contend that while just about everything is in need of greater transparency – the country is rated 120 out of 180 of the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International – Hartwell stressed that “the energy trade has always been the worst.”

“The gas trade, for example, is how billions were siphoned off from the public and put into private hands, a problem which went on for years under government protection,” he continued. “Private energy firms are welcome in Ukraine as they provide much-needed competition against government monopolies, but given the heavy hand of government in every facet of energy, it’s still a too-cozy world with ample opportunities for corruption.”

Furthermore, Paraschiy pointed out that historically, [oil and gas] was a business of “people close to power, either central government or local governments.”

“We have some cases of private companies non-related to power brokers or oligarchs,” he said. “But, it is rather the exception.”

HAS JOSEPH MIFSUD RESURFACED? ALLEGED AUDIO OF MYSTERIOUS PROFESSOR EMERGES TWO YEARS AFTER DISAPPEARANCE

Another well-placed source connected to Ukraine’s energy industry, who requested anonymity, contended to Fox News that Biden came onto Burisma’s board “long after the questionable transactions occurred,” and the industry overall has made vast improvements in terms of corruption in recent years.

“Burisma did what many companies do all around the world. They hire people with recognition,” the source said. “Burisma is a legitimate producer of oil and gas, present on the new, liberalized market. We actively trade with them – buying and selling of gas – and they act in a professional, commercial manner.”

The insider commenced working with Burisma in 2014 soon after Biden joined the board but underscored that many were not personally aware he was even associated until it emerged in the press.

“I believe that my assistance in consulting the Company on matters of transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion and other priorities will contribute to the economy and benefit the people of Ukraine,” Biden wrote in a release soon after joining the Board in 2014.

Others beg to differ.

“By inviting influential foreigners, Ukrainian business wants to get additional protection, PR and lobby mechanisms to grasp additional spheres of interest. Having Hunter Biden on board, the owner of Burisma wanted to correct the image and to get cover, because authorities are scared by the U.S. embassy in Ukraine,” Egorov said. “Hunter Biden, using the political capabilities of his family, acted as a rescue buffer between Burisma and Ukrainian law enforcement agencies. His work in the company of a corrupt official smells bad.”

But by 2017, Burisma announced that it was not encountering any active prosecution cases. It then inked a partnership with the Washington think tank, the Atlantic Council, centered on combating corruption efforts in Ukraine.

And despite the investigations having been shuttered years ago, Burisma’s days of being probed are perhaps not yet behind them.

In October, the country’s prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, announced that his office would be reviewing the closed cases to ensure that they were appropriately handled – with the Burisma file still on the table. State Department official George Kent testified at the first public hearing of the House impeachment inquiry last week that, “since U.S. taxpayers are wasted,” he “would love to see the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office find who the corrupt prosecutor was that took the bribe and how much was paid.”"

Warren's support has dropped six percentage points from the September CNN/DMR/Mediacom poll, while Biden's backing has slipped five percentage points. Sanders' support has risen four percentage points from two months ago.

Buttigieg has moved to the front of the pack in other recent polls of Iowa. A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday pegged Buttigieg at 22 percent, Biden at 19 percent, Warren at 18 percent and Sanders at 13 percent. Buttigieg's support jumped 14 percentage points compared to Monmouth’s last survey in August, while Biden’s dropped seven percentage points, Warren’s edged down two percentage points, and Sanders jumped five percentage points from the August survey.

A Quinnipiac survey released last week however had Buttigieg one point behind Warren, at 19 and 20 percentage points respectively.

Buttigieg is a 37-year-old Navy war veteran and would be America’s first openly gay president if elected. Without any sort of Washington name-recognition, the mayor’s campaign seemed a longshot before he rose to middle-tier status in the spring.

Buttigieg for many seems to offer a more moderate approach than the radical policy proposals of Warren and Sanders, and unlike Biden, he does not have to fight many concerns about his age or past voting record. Among Iowa caucusgoers, 63 percent say Buttigieg's views are about right, while only seven percent say they are too liberal and 13 percent say they are too conservative.

According to the CNN/DMR poll, Buttigieg excels with caucusgoers with incomes over $100,000 (32 percent) and self-described moderates (also 32 percent) but underperforms with union households (17 percent) and those who call themselves very liberal (12 percent)."

Obama on Friday warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls to pay attention to what voters actually think, claiming at a gathering of Democratic donors that most of them don’t want to “tear down the system” and that many Democrats “just don’t want to see crazy stuff.” Members of his party soon turned on him, using the hashtag #TooFarLeft.

OBAMA SOUNDS OFF ON CANCEL CULTURE, ‘WOKE’ PURITY: ‘THAT’S NOT ACTIVISM’

“I’m #TooFarLeft because I want kids to be safe in school. I’m #TooFarLeft because I want people to live in dignity. I’m #TooFarLeft because I seek justice and equality. I’m #TooFarLeft because I think healthcare and housing are human rights,” tweeted former Hillary Clinton adviser Peter Daou, who started the hashtag.

Daou clarified Sunday evening that the slogan ""isn't primarily about Obama for me, though he was the catalyst for the tag.""

It quickly went viral, used by other liberal Democrats such as Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar.

Celebrities weighed in as well. Former “Two and a Half Men” star Jon Cryer claimed a ""far left"" position is necessary to counter an existential threat to humanity.

“I am #TooFarLeft because I believe that we cannot let greed cause the collapse of the ecosystem that supports all human life on earth,” he tweeted.

This is not the first time Obama has taken a stance against the leftward drift of the party or been on the receiving end of criticism for allegedly being too moderate.

During a discussion at the Obama Foundation Summit held at the Illinois Institute of Technology in October, Obama explained that the world is more complicated than people realize and urged politically active Americans to be practical if they want to be effective.

“This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said.

In addition, he has not been straightforward about his dealings with the whistleblower, who initially was pivotal to charges against the president but who is now deemed inconsequential by Schiff.

It is common knowledge that the initial complaint was launched by a Democrat with ties to President Trump’s adversaries. That revelation has sucked even more legitimacy from the investigation.

As a result of these several missteps, the public is wary of what has emerged as an obviously partisan attack on a duly elected president. Worse, they are also, already, bored and, we’re not even in the home stretch.

If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Adding to the public’s ennui is that the resolution of the impeachment is a foregone conclusion. It’s like Agatha Christie revealing whodunit in Chapter One; it steals the story’s punch.

We know Democrats will press forward with their tiresome questioning and posturing, hoping to convince the nation that the hearings are something bigger and nobler than a political stunt. They will vote to impeach; that has always been a foregone conclusion.

The carnival will then move to the Senate, which will ultimately hold a trial and find the president not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats know this; they know there is no real purpose to their impeachment thrust but to undermine Mr. Trump before the 2020 campaign.

It's a risky way to win an election. If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Also, a partisan investigation will energize Trump supporters and drive turnout among Republicans.

Even the Trump-hating New York Times struggled to find much meaning in the impeachment proceedings. In their coverage of the first day of hearings, reporter Peter Baker was reduced to glorifying star witness and diplomat William Taylor’s appearance: “the image, at least, of a wise, fatherly figure” with a “chiseled face and reassuring gray hair” whose “deep baritone voice [was] reminiscent of Walter Cronkite.” Channeling Gregory Peck apparently enhances Taylor’s credibility.

The liberal media did hyperventilate over Taylor’s “new” revelation that someone on his staff “asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine.” Sondland, according to the aide, according to Taylor, said the president “cares more about the investigations of Bidens.” In other words, third-hand hearsay.

Disappointing to Democrats, Taylor refused to climb aboard the impeachment train. Moreover, that Taylor had never once met with or talked to President Trump undermined the impact of his testimony, notwithstanding his admirable elocution.

To be sure, it is clear that Taylor disapproved of President Trump’s reportedly tying $391 million in aid to Kiev to an investigation into possible misdeeds by Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He said that holding up that assistance for political purposes is wrong. It is unclear what Taylor thought of President Obama’s steadfast refusal to authorize that much-needed help during his administration.

Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was sent back to the United States because the White House heard she was openly critical of the president, was not even in the Ukraine when the events under review took place. The president is entitled to have representatives in foreign countries who are on his team. End of story.

Taylor, Yovanovitch and other witnesses, including the still missing-in-action whistleblower, have no first-hand evidence that Trump threatened to withhold aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens. That is still a critical missing link.

As the inquiry drags on, more Americans will tune out. The TV audience on the first day of the Schiff show was far less than the number who watched the confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or even Michael Cohen’s testimony.

Schiff himself was tweeting his followers to watch in an embarrassing effort to gin up enthusiasm. The audience will shrink further.

Democratic candidates slugging it out in Iowa and New Hampshire are rarely asked about impeachment. Instead, voters ask about health care and other issues; campaigners are struggling to explain how they are rewarding voters for giving their party the majority in the House.

Some of those candidates will soon view the impeachment drive as an even bigger threat. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker – all 2020 candidates – will have to participate in the eventual Senate trial. That means they will have to sit in the Senate day after day, while rivals like Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg run circles around them on the campaign trail.

It is almost inconceivable that Democrats have allowed Adam Schiff to play ringmaster for this circus. As a major author of the Russia collusion narrative, Schiff was already reviled on the right.

As he leads his own party down the impeachment rabbit hole, Schiff may come under fire from Democrats as well, and especially from those senators trying to win the primaries.

And let’s not forget the damage Schiff has done to front-runner Joe Biden. After all, the one critical part of the Ukraine story that is regurgitated with each telling is that Biden’s son Hunter monetized his father’s unique status not only in Kiev but also in China. That has soiled the former vice president’s candidacy.

The hearings are not over but it is hard to see today how impeachment will prove a winner for Democrats. Nancy Pelosi should have stuck to her guns, and never let this process move forward, and especially with Adam Schiff at the helm.

“Our Crazy, Do Nothing (where’s USMCA, infrastructure, lower drug pricing & much more?) Speaker of the House, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they & Fake News Media are her BOSS), suggested on Sunday’s DEFACE THE NATION that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt,” Trump tweeted, in a derogatory reference to ""Face the Nation.""

“She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” he continued.

The president’s tweet comes after Pelosi, D-Calif., challenged him to testify before Congress if he wants to set the record straight.

“The president could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants. He has every opportunity to present his case,” Pelosi said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Pelosi extended the invitation ahead of a week that is expected to be jam-packed with witness testimony in the impeachment inquiry. Pelosi said lawmakers would “look forward” to seeing any information from Trump “that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also echoed the suggestion.

“If Donald Trump doesn’t agree with what he’s hearing, doesn’t like what he’s hearing, he shouldn’t tweet,” Schumer said. “He should come to the committee and testify under oath. And he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath.""

The challenge was paired with Pelosi's warning not to go after the whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry — though Democrats initially had indicated that the whistleblower could testify, only to back off and now urge Trump to testify instead.

""I will make sure he does not intimidate the whistleblower,"" Pelosi said. ""I told the president you're in my wheelhouse when you come after the whistleblower.""

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

On the call, Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement.

Van Drew said he plans to vote against articles of impeachment unless he hears evidence against President Trump that ""rises to the level of treason or a high crime.""

""But we don't see that,"" Van Drew argued, saying the testimony so far has been on ""hearsay"" about what Trump told the president of Ukraine about an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden's son, Hunter.

He said the ""Founding Fathers had vigorous debates of whether they would even allow impeachment in the Constitution,"" and said he favors allowing voters to decide the matter in next year's election.

IMPEACHMENT PROBE DRAWS IN TRUMP’S ANSWERS TO MUELLER

NYT: “Impeachment investigators are exploring whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Robert S. Mueller III during the Russia investigation, a lawyer for the House told a federal appeals court on Monday, raising the prospect of bringing an additional basis for a Senate trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. … During the Mueller investigation, Mr. Trump refused to testify orally about what he knew and did during the 2016 campaign in relation to Russia’s election interference operation, or his later efforts to impede the special counsel’s inquiry. But he did provide lawyerly written answers to some questions, which were appended to the Mueller report. On Monday, Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court panel that impeachment investigators have an ‘immense’ need to see the grand jury evidence — redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the underlying testimony transcripts they came from — because Mr. Trump may have lied.”



Ukrainian president reportedly felt the pressure long before Trump’s squeeze - AP: “Despite his denials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden before his July phone call with President Donald Trump that has led to impeachment hearings. In early May, staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were briefed on a meeting Zelenskiy held in which he sought advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, according to two people with knowledge of the briefings. He was concerned that Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race, the people said. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.”



Trump defenders’ new stance: The quid pro quo failed - NYT: “House Republicans, bracing for another week of impeachment hearings, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition… [L]awmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld — but later released — $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. … On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of ‘Fox News Sunday,’ pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might ‘blow a hole’ in Republicans’ defense. ‘The president’s defense is that those things didn’t happen,’ Mr. Scalise said, adding: ‘The real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.’”



In a murky sea of disinformation and bias, voters tune out - NYT: “The Democrats in Congress took their case against President Trump to the public last week. But after hours of testimony, thousands of news reports and days of streaming headlines, one thing was clear: A lot of Americans weren’t listening. … In this volatile political moment, information, it would seem, has never been more crucial. The country is in the midst of impeachment proceedings against a president for the third time in modern history. A high-stakes election is less than a year away. But just when information is needed most, to many Americans it feels most elusive. The rise of social media; the proliferation of information online, including news designed to deceive; and a flood of partisan news are leading to a general exhaustion with news itself. Add to that a president with a documented record of regularly making false statements and the result is a strange new normal: Many people are numb and disoriented, struggling to discern what is real in a sea of slant, fake and fact.”



Trump reportedly vexed by Pompeo’s failure to rein in diplomats - NBC News: “The impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to four current and former senior administration officials. Trump has fumed for weeks that Pompeo is responsible for hiring State Department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency, the officials said. The president confronted Pompeo about the officials – and what he believed was a lackluster effort by the secretary of state to block their testimony – during lunch at the White House on Oct. 29, those familiar with the matter said. Inside the White House, the view was that Trump ‘just felt like, ‘rein your people in,’’ a senior administration official said. Trump particularly blames Pompeo for tapping Ambassador Bill Taylor in June to be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the current and former senior administration officials said.”

TIME OUT: FITTED FOR A QUEEN

Atlantic: “Clothes, in [the Netflix series] The Crown, have always been part of the aesthetic pleasure the show provides viewers—a crucial element of the absurd spectacle that is royalist Britain… And yet, watching Season 3 [released Nov. 17], [The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert noticed] more than ever how the series uses clothing to explore and subvert ideas about power, and what it looks like when a woman wields it. … [Queen Elizabeth’s] gender, and her femininity, are intrinsic to the way she governs.… In reality, as in the show, the Queen’s deployment of pastel colors and pearls isn’t just a matter of personal taste. Since her coronation in 1953, when the Queen requested that her gown for the event be embroidered with symbols from countries in the British Commonwealth … every outfit she’s worn has been worn with intention. Clothing, for the Queen, is much more about diplomacy and visibility than style.”

BUTTI-BOOM, BUTTI-BING

Des Moines Register: “Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”



Biden strikes cautious tone on pot - WaPo: “On the question of marijuana, former vice president Joe Biden might seem out of step with the crowd. … But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released Nov. 14. This disparity on the topic came into full view at a town hall in Las Vegas over the weekend, when Biden drew some groans from the crowd by saying he wants to see more research on marijuana and suggesting that it may be a ‘gateway drug’ that can lead users to harsher substances.”



Harry Reid credits Biden’s Nevada success to minority appeal - AP: “Iowa and New Hampshire get to weigh in first on the Democratic presidential contest next year, but the states are not ethnically diverse enough to offer any insight into how a candidate will fare across the country, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday. … Reid said he thinks that former Vice President Joe Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”



As Harris craters, blame game ramps up - Politico: “Kamala Harris’ campaign is careening toward a crackup. As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. … The internal strife is the latest discouraging development for Harris’ once-encouraging candidacy. She has slid into low single digits and is now banking on a top-tier performance in Iowa to pull her back into contention. Inside the campaign, which had already experienced staff shakeups before the layoffs, rank and file aides are fed up with the weak leadership and uncertainty around internal communication, planning and executing on a clear vision. They say the constant shifting has eroded trust in the upper ranks.”



Pressure rises at home for speedy exit - Politico: “Harris’ loyal activist base, who call themselves the K-Hive, have lost none of the passion and intensity from those early days. … But in the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”



Warren’s Medicare hedge does little to quell doubts - WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been mostly sure-footed in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. One exception is health care. On Friday, she issued another proposal to go along with her support for Medicare-for-all, a step that appeared designed to put her into a safer place politically. Warren’s progression on health care through the course of the campaign has taken her from a position of flexibility to one of seeming inflexibility — at least until Friday. Over a period of months, she walked herself into a place that many Democrats feared could make her chances of winning a general election more, not less, difficult. Whether Friday’s turn alleviates those worries remains to be seen.”



Younger voters still dig Bernie - WBUR: “Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders remains the top choice for young likely voters, coming in at 28% in the [Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters under age 30]. That's down 3 percentage points since the spring. The 78-year-old Sanders has long had strong support among the under-30 set. [Twenty-two percent of likely 18- to 29-year-old voters would choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary. That’s up 18 points from her showing in March.] Another septuagenarian, former Vice President Joe Biden, comes in third in the Harvard survey, with the backing of 16% of likely voters. The youngest Democratic candidate, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is fifth, at just 4%.”



Bloomberg continues apology tour - Fox News: “Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has yet to formally announce whether he will run for president in 2020, but during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, he apologized for his controversial ‘stop and frisk’ policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration. That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his Sunday speech, Bloomberg recognized that this led to ‘far too many innocent people’ being stopped, many of them black or Latino. ‘I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong.’”



Lefties see conspiracy behind Patrick, Bloomberg runs - Politico: “Democratic donors say they want Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick to run for president because they’re petrified that a left-wing candidate can’t defeat President Donald Trump. But progressives see a more sinister effort afoot. Aides and allies to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among other liberals, perceive the eleventh-hour campaign launched last week by Patrick — and the prospect of an impending Bloomberg 2020 bid — as an attempt to crush an ascendant left wing that would expand government more than any other Democratic president in decades. In their view, Patrick and Bloomberg are stalking horses for moderate Democrats, high-dollar contributors and bundlers desperate to halt the momentum of the economic populists at the top of the polls — and regain control of the party levers.”



Can anyone break the Coolidge curse? - NYT: “Voters have never elected a sitting mayor to the presidency. Americans have seldom embraced anyone who’s even touched the job. Calvin Coolidge was the last president, one of just three in 230 years, to have been a mayor at any point. He led Northampton, Mass. – a modest town, really – for two years. But as the Democratic Party becomes ever more aligned with urban areas, its presidential field is now studded with politicians whose boasts include running a city. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has now jumped to the lead in Iowa polling. Also in the race are two recent mayors, Julián Castro and Cory Booker, and another candidate who got his start as a mayor, Bernie Sanders. The current New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and a former Denver mayor, John Hickenlooper, have already come and gone, while Michael Bloomberg, another New York mayor, is still calculating on the sidelines.”



TRUMP CRAPS OUT ON GUBERNATORIAL GAMBLES

Politico: “President Donald Trump campaigned hard in three conservative Southern states this fall, aiming for a string of gubernatorial wins that would demonstrate his political strength heading into impeachment and his own reelection effort. The plan backfired in dramatic fashion. The latest black eye came on Saturday, when Trump's favored candidate in Louisiana, multimillionaire businessman Eddie Rispone, went down to defeat. The president went all-in, visiting the state three times, most recently on Thursday. Earlier this month, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost reelection after a similar presidential effort on his behalf. Of the candidates Trump backed, only Tate Reeves in Mississippi won. The losses raise questions about Trump’s standing as he heads into what will be a grueling 2020 campaign. By throwing himself into the three contests — each in states that Trump won by double-digits in 2016 — the president had hoped to gain a modicum of political momentum at a perilous moment of his presidency.”

DEEP YOGURT

USA Today: “[Patricia] Larkin, of Lacey, New Jersey, said in the Facebook group ‘Lacey Township Chatter’ that she was grocery shopping with her infant when a woman told a cashier that her baby was fake and an attempt to ‘smuggle yogurts out of the store.’ Larkin, despite being fatigued from staying up nights with her 2-month-old daughter, responded to the accusation with humor. She posted a picture of herself smiling while holding her sleeping baby in front of the store's sign. ‘Thank you for the laugh,’ she wrote in the Facebook group. ‘1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all.’ Larkin said a similarly amused cashier told her about the woman's accusation, by which time, her infant daughter was crying and fussing like only a real baby could.”

Taylor, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee last Wednesday, said he had just learned about the July phone call this month.

EMBASSY OFFICIAL SAYS HE HEARD ABOUT TRUMP-SONDLAND CALL ABOUT UKRAINE 'INVESTIGATIONS'

But Holmes’ timeline of events, according to a written statement from his closed-door interview, seems to depart from Taylor’s -- saying he notified Taylor of the call shortly after it happened.

Holmes, who is the political counsel at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, told congressional investigators that he was at a restaurant in Kiev on July 26 when Sondland spoke to Trump over the phone—just one day after Trump’s now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he asked for investigations into the Bidens and 2016 election meddling.

Holmes testified that Trump was speaking so loudly that Sondland had to hold the phone away from his ear, which allowed others to hear. Holmes said that Sondland told Trump that Zelensky “loves your ass,” to which Trump replied: “So he’s gonna do the investigation?”

“He’s gonna do it,” Sondland replied.

Holmes testified that after the call, Sondland said Trump did not “give a sh-- about Ukraine” and only cared about “big stuff” like the “Biden investigation.”

Holmes testified that he brought the contents of the call to Taylor’s attention when he returned to the embassy following a vacation that ended Aug. 6.

“After returning to the embassy, I told Ambassador Taylor about the July 26 call,” Holmes said. “I also repeatedly referred to the call and conversation with Ambassador Sondland in meetings and conversations where the issue of the president’s interest in Ukraine was potentially relevant.”

Holmes added, however, that amid the more recent media coverage surrounding the impeachment inquiry, he “made the observation to Ambassador Taylor that the incident I had witnessed has acquired greater significance, which is what he reported in his testimony earlier this week.”

Holmes seemed to indicate that he was merely reminding Taylor of the July 26 phone call, but in his testimony last week, Taylor seemed to indicate that he was only just hearing about the call.

Taylor, in the dramatic moment during last week’s hearing, claimed that “last Friday” a staff member “told him of events that occurred on July 26.”

TAYLOR CLAIMS STAFFER OVERHEARD TRUMP ASKING ABOUT 'INVESTIGATIONS'

“At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information,” Taylor testified. “I am including it here for completeness.”

The Trump campaign flagged the apparent conflict over the weekend, saying: “Both of these testimonies cannot be true.”

“The testimonies contradict one another regarding when Holmes told Taylor about the call he claims to have overheard,” the Trump campaign said in a statement. “If Holmes immediately told numerous people at the embassy about the phone call, and 'repeatedly referred' to it 'in meetings and conversations,' why did Taylor never hear about it from Holmes or someone else? Why wouldn't it have appeared in Taylor's supposedly meticulous notes?”

Holmes was back on Capitol Hill Monday, possibly to review his testimony.

While the reason for the timing discrepancy is not clear, it is not in question that Trump was seeking investigations.

The transcript of his July 25 phone call, released by the White House, showed that he was, indeed, asking Zelensky to open the investigations. The anecdote about the phone call Holmes purportedly overheard would only underscore that the president was continuing to follow up on those investigations after his call with Zelensky.

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Kiev. That call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement. Trump denies that.

The president added, “Wow, she’s CRAZY!”

This morning, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who really ought to know better, picked up on Trump’s line, publishing a similarly misguided missive: “Speaker of the U.S. House of [sic] says its ‘dangerous’ to ‘let the election decide’ if [the president] should remain in office. Translation? ‘We can’t trust backwards, uneducated, everyday people to decide the Presidency, this must be decided by the enlightened people in Washington D.C.’”

Since this is apparently poised to be the Republican Party’s new toy, it’s worth pausing to shine a light on reality. Yesterday afternoon, around 2 p.m. (ET), Speaker Pelosi sent a letter to House members on the congressional impeachment inquiry. It read in part:

“The facts are uncontested: that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit, at the expense of our national security interests. “The weak response to these hearings has been, ‘Let the election decide.’ That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.”

Even those with modest reading-comprehension skills can see Pelosi did not write what Trump and Rubio claimed.

On the contrary, the Speaker raised an important point that Trump, Rubio, and other Republicans have struggled to address.

As we discussed last week, a variety of prominent GOP voices – former Ambassador Nikki Haley, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), et al. – have made the case that lawmakers should skip impeachment proceedings and simply allow the 2020 election to decide Trump’s fate. If the American electorate has a problem with Trump’s abuses, they can choose someone new. If voters are unmoved by the president’s corruption, they make that clear, too.

The trouble, of course, is the nature of the scandal itself. One of the key pillars of the whole controversy has been a simple fact: Trump intended to cheat in the election by way of an extortion scheme. The president, rightly or wrongly, saw Joe Biden as a credible electoral threat, which led him to push a vulnerable foreign ally to cook up some dirt Republicans could use before Election Day.

To let this go unpunished is to effectively encourage the president who knows no limits, and believes there can be no checks on his misconduct, to keep exploring other cheating options.

The broader national goal should be to ensure that the United States has a free and fair election next year. Trump has already taken steps that are fundamentally at odds with that goal.

It’s not as if the president has rolled out some kind of “mea culpa” defense, acknowledging poor judgment, and assuring the public that he intends to stop trying to screw around with the 2020 cycle. On the contrary, Trump has done largely the opposite, insisting his actions were “perfect,” permissible, and literally unimpeachable.

To ask “the American people” to decide the proper resolution is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months. Trump has already made it painfully obvious that he has a very different plan in mind. As former Solicitor General Neal Katyal recently put it, “Asking us to wait until the election to remove him from office is like asking to resolve a dispute based on who wins a game of Monopoly – when the very crime you’ve been accused of is cheating on Monopoly.”

This is the point Pelosi made in writing yesterday. It’s also the point Republicans like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio seem eager to avoid."

It appears Tillerson is comfortable occasionally returning rhetorical fire.,2019-11-19,MSNBC,Hell hath no fury like a former Secretary of State scorned,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/hell-hath-no-fury-former-secretary-state-scorned,"About a year ago, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke at an event in Houston and shared some uncomplimentary thoughts about Donald Trump. According to the nation’s former chief diplomat, the president is “pretty undisciplined,” “doesn’t like to read,” and “often” urged Tillerson to pursue policies that were inconsistent with American laws.

Trump wasn’t pleased, responding on Twitter that Tillerson was “dumb as a rock,” “lazy as hell,” and lacking in “mental capacity.”

Several months later, Tillerson testified on Capitol Hill about U.S. foreign policy and the degree to which Trump was at a disadvantage when he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Germany in 2017 – because Putin was prepared, and Trump was not. The American president again turned to Twitter to lash out, again describing Tillerson as “dumb as a rock.”

If the recent pattern holds, we should expect another angry tweet from Trump any minute now.

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday told the PBS NewsHour that asking for personal favors and using United States assets as collateral is “wrong.” Tillerson spoke with NewsHour anchor and managing editor Judy Woodruff at a luncheon hosted by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in San Antonio. Tillerson discussed reports that President Donald Trump pushed to withhold from Ukraine nearly $400 million in military aid until the country’s president agreed to open investigations into political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden.

Tillerson specifically told PBS, “If you’re seeking some kind of personal gain and you’re using – whether it’s American foreign aid or American weapons or American influence – that’s wrong.”

Obviously, this in no way resembles the official White House line on Trump’s Ukraine scandal.

What the president has never understood about his antagonistic relationship with Tillerson is that the former secretary of State can cause Trump more harm than Trump can cause Tillerson. No matter what insulting remarks the president makes about the former secretary of State, Tillerson remains wholly unaffected.

But when a former top member of the president’s cabinet takes rhetorical shots in Trump’s direction, it has more of an impact.

What’s more, Tillerson may yet do even more damage, given his knowledge about Trump’s dubious intervention in support of one of Rudy Giuliani’s more controversial clients.

As for the former cabinet secretary’s comments to PBS yesterday, Tillerson added, “I don’t worry about the future. I believe the American people are smart. I believe the American people ultimately, if they see something that they don’t feel is serving the American people or serving our national security,” they will make a change.

Part of me wonders whether the Democratic presidential nominee next year might reach out to Tillerson for an endorsement."

Democrats have argued that the White House improperly pressured Ukraine to look into the Bidens and Burisma Holdings, the natural gas company where Hunter Biden held a lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president. George Kent, a State Department official who has also testified in the impeachment investigation, said he flagged Hunter Biden's apparent conflict of interest to the Obama administration at the time.

However, Hale said, he saw the Bidens referenced only in media reports -- as well as in a ""speculative"" email from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who testified last week. Hale is scheduled to testify publicly Wednesday.

Yovanovitch ""mentioned that Mayor [Rudy] Giuliani might have been motivated to sully Vice President Biden's reputation by reminding the world of the issue regarding his son's activities in Ukraine,"" Hale testified, referring to President Trump's personal attorney.

KEY WITNESS APPEARS TO DIRECTLY CONTRADICT DIPLOMAT IN DEMS' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

""When the whistleblower reports and all that came out of that, that's when I first saw this,"" Hale, the under secretary of state for political affairs, testified.

Separately, Hale recalled that representatives from key executive departments -- including the Treasury Department, Office of Management and Budget, Department of Homeland Security and State Department -- ""endorsed the resumption of military aid"" to Ukraine.

Under questioning from Democrats, Hale acknowledged he was ""out of the loop"" on a variety of matters, and that Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland didn't brief him about ""discussions he was having with his Ukraine counterparts to either condition the White House meeting or the aid on these investigations."" Additionally, Hale noted that he was similarly ""out of the loop"" on acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's discussions with the president concerning Ukraine aid.

TOP GOP REP DEMANDS POSTPONEMENT, CITING NEW 'DEVELOPMENT' IN IMPEACHMENT PROBE

Mulvaney has acknowledged that White House assistance to Ukraine was tied to the country's broader anti-corruption efforts, although he did not state that the aid was linked to a probe of the Bidens in particular.

""This is a corrupt place. Everyone knows this is a corrupt place ... Plus, I'm not sure that the other European countries are helping them out either,"" Mulvaney said last month. He added: ""Did [Trump] also mention to me, in the past, the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that, but that's it, and that's why we held up the money ... The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation, and that is absolutely appropriate.""

Also late Monday, Democrats released testimony from State Department official David Holmes, who said in his Nov. 15 deposition that the conversation he overheard between Trump and Sondland during a lunch in Ukraine was so distinctive — even extraordinary — that nobody needed to refresh his memory.

Holmes testified that he told ""a number of friends of mine"" about the call because it was ""like, a really extraordinary thing"" to be ""part of"" a lunch in which ""someone called the president."" He insisted he didn't go into detail about the call while he boasted about it, but estimated that he may have told as many as six friends.

""I've never seen anything like this,"" Holmes told House investigators, ""someone calling the president from a mobile phone at a restaurant, and then having a conversation of this level of candor, colorful language. There's just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly.""

Holmes testified that after a bottle of wine, Sondland ""said that he was going to call President Trump to give him an update. Ambassador Sondland placed a call on his mobile phone, and I heard him announce himself several times, along the lines of: 'Gordon Sondland holding for the president.' It appeared that he was being transferred through several layers of switchboards and assistances. I then noticed Ambassador Sondland’s demeanor change, and understood that he had been connected to President Trump.""

TRUMP 'STRONGLY' CONSIDERING PELOSI INVITE TO TESTIFY IN IMPEACHMENT PROBE

The conversation between the president and the ambassador July 26 came one day after the call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to the impeachment inquiry.

Holmes' account of the conversation in Kiev was the first to include Trump personally calling about the investigations into Democrats and Joe Biden.

Holmes, who joined Sondland and others during the lunch meeting, told investigators Trump was talking so loudly he could hear the president clearly on the ambassador's phone.

""I then heard President Trump ask, quote, 'So he's going to do the investigation?'"" Holmes testified. ""Ambassador Sondland replied that 'He's going to do it,' adding that President Zelensky will, quote, 'do anything you ask him to.'""

Holmes said he didn't take notes of the conversation he overheard between Trump and Sondland but remembered it ""vividly.""

Pressed during the interview if anyone helped him recall the details, Holmes said, ""that wouldn’t have been needed, sir, because, as I said, the event itself was so distinctive that I remember it very clearly.""

Holmes said Sondland announced that the president was ""in a bad mood."" And, Holmes said he ""asked Ambassador Sondland if it was true that the president did not give a sh-- about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland agreed that the president did not give a sh-- about Ukraine..nope, not at all, doesn’t give a sh-- about Ukraine.""

Holmes said the president ""only cares about 'big stuff.'"" Holmes testified that Sondland said that didn't mean war with Russia, but ""this Biden investigation that Giuliani is pushing.""

During a meeting between then-National Security Advisor John Bolton and Zelensky’s top aide Andriy Bogdan in Kiev, Holmes served as note-taker. Holmes indicated Bolton was frustrated ""about Giuliani's influence with the president, making clear that there was nothing he could do about it.""

""I came to believe it was the president's political agenda"" that Guiliani was pursuing in Ukraine, Holmes went on, ""because Mr. Giuliani was promoting that investigations issue, which later I came to understand, including through these various interactions, that was -- that the president cared about.""

Holmes, a political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, is scheduled to testify publicly Thursday.

But two new public opinion surveys in South Carolina – the first Southern state to vote in the race for the White House - shows the former vice president holding a large lead over his rivals for the Democratic nomination.

Biden – he has deep ties to South Carolina -- stands at 33 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in the Palmetto State, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Monday. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is a distant second – at 13 percent -- with Sanders at 11 percent and Buttigieg at 6 percent.

And Biden stands at 36 percent among likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters in a University of South Florida survey, with Sanders and Warren tied for second at just 10 percent.

“Unlike tight races in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina has a clear front-runner in the Democratic primary,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said. “Former Vice President Joe Biden has broad based appeal, with particularly strong leads among black and moderate/conservative voters.”

Hedge-fund manager turned billionaire environment and progressive grassroots advocate Tom Steyer stands at 5 percent in the poll, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 2 percent. Everyone else in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registers at 1 percent or less.

The poll indicates Biden’s the most favorably viewed of all the candidates, with a 71 percent-18 percent favorable-unfavorable rating. The former vice president’s plus-53 net favorability rating is 17 points higher than Sanders and 22 points higher than Warren.

The poll’s release comes days after former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick jumped into the race, and amid speculation that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is poised to launch a presidential bid.

Snow noted that Patrick “has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him.”

“More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough -- but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably,"" she added.

And Snow pointed out that “where South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.”

Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and others running for the party's 2020 nomination -- came a day after Biden told a town hall audience in Las Vegas that he still hasn’t seen enough evidence that marijuana is not a gateway drug, so he can't yet back legalizing weed.

SANDERS INTRODUCES PLAN TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA NATIONWIDE DURING FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE



Last year, Sanders' home state of Vermont legalized possession of one ounce of pot and letting each adult resident grow two plants for personal use. He has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide and argued criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.



""Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Biden, however, spoke in favor of a more cautious approach. He said states should be able to legalize marijuana if they want but added he wouldn’t overturn federal law right away.



In addition, he supports medical marijuana and believes possession of the substance ""should not be a crime,"" the Business Insider report said.



Much of Biden’s 40-year Senate career took place during the federal government's War on Drugs, which included harsh criminal penalties for nonviolent drug users, Business Insider reported.



The former vice president also said in a June campaign speech that he supported expunging past convictions for possession.

But contrary to Biden's Las Vegas comments, several national organizations say there is no solid evidence to support the claim that using marijuana leads to the use of harder drugs, the report said. A 1999 Institute of Medicine report said marijuana ""typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use,"" but it ""does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse; that is, care must be taken not to attribute cause to association.""



The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that research shows ""the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, 'harder' substances,"" and drug use can be affected by numerous other biological and environmental factors, the report continued.



The majority of current candidates openly support nationwide legalization.



Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, with only nine states where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent Gallup poll found 66 percent of Americans support fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.



The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.



While Sanders became the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates Warren and Booker as well as Sen. Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records."

But lost in much of the coverage of the dramatic hearings is what this Ukrainian natural gas firm actually does and the controversy it's generated in the past -- beyond the now well-known fact that Hunter Biden served on its board, thus arousing the suspicion of the Trump White House and touching off the series of events leading to impeachment proceedings.

TENSIONS BOIL OVER AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING, AS NUNES ACCUSES SCHIFF OF 'GAGGING' LAWMAKERS

While both sides of the aisle fiercely debate the propriety of the younger Biden's role, the company itself has long been tied to controversy.

“Burisma’s reputation in Ukraine is low, and was dubious before (the impeachment inquiry) due to the scandals surrounding the owner,” Igor Egorov, the president of the Kiev-based nonprofit Anticorruption Entrepreneurial Front, told Fox News, underscoring that it hasn’t stopped the company from financial growth.

“Burisma is among the top five oil, drilling, and production companies and planned to drill 21 new wells in 2019, expanding its production capabilities,"" Egorov said. ""Burisma Holdings controls many companies in the oil & gas industry – the group was successful due to relations with authorities.”

The White House embroilment unraveled in late September following a whistleblower complaint, which raised alarms that Trump may have withheld military aid to Ukraine in pressuring the newly elected Volodymyr Zelensky government to investigate Hunter Biden’s recent role as a Burisma board member.

Hunter Biden joined the board after being discharged from the Navy Reserve for drug use, at a time when Burisma was engulfed in corruption investigation woes, and at a time when his father Joe Biden as vice president was leading the Obama administration’s effort to curb Ukraine’s endemic corruption. He stepped down in April when Biden announced his 2020 presidential aspirations.

Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have repeatedly made the accusation that Biden inappropriately leveraged his White House position to have Viktor Shokin, then Ukraine's leading prosecutor, fired in March 2016 to avoid implicating Hunter in corruption investigations. Joe Biden's campaign has vigorously disputed this -- saying he urged the firing for the exact opposite reason: Shokin wasn’t doing enough.

Nonetheless, Burisma is on the Washington map amid the cloud of controversy.

“Burisma is better known in the U.S. than in Ukraine,” said Alexander Paraschiy, the head of research at Kiev-based investment firm, Concorde Capital. “Experts know that the company belongs to former minister of Yanukovych government, and taking into account that Yanukovych has a poor reputation, so [does founder Mykola] Zlochevsky.”

So who did Hunter Biden serve during his lucrative position earning upwards of $50,000 per month?

Burisma was founded in 2002 by oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, who was closely aligned to the now-exiled former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Zlochevsky served as the minister of ecology and natural resources from July 2010 until April 2012 and then as deputy secretary for economic and social security until February 2014 when the notoriously pro-Russian Yanukovych was forced to flee to Moscow.

Soon after, Zlochevsky himself absconded when Ukraine’s prosecutor general put him on the country’s watch list and opened numerous probes into his practices and multitude of businesses, flanked by allegations of money laundering and tax evasion. Moreover, questions have long swirled as to how he granted licenses for the development of mineral deposit extraction during his government post.

“[Zlochevsky] was suspected of violations while providing gas production licenses and permits to his own companies,” Paraschiy explained, emphasizing that even after Biden’s tenure on the board, he “doubted that the image has changed.”

Ukrainian records, according to The Wall Street Journal, show that Burisma’s two main subsidiaries were awarded their exploration permits during Zlochevsky’s official reign. His assets were frozen in the U.K, but citing a lack of evidence produced by the Serious Fraud Office, the Central Criminal Court in London later discharged the order.

Nonetheless, Burisma’s website touts that it is the “first, and only fully integrated gas operator in Ukraine engaged in the exploration, production, processing, transportation and final sale of hydrocarbons” and has 35 licenses in all major basins in Ukraine, and paid some $24.6 million in taxes over the past two years. It has also, using Hunter Biden’s image, promoted its desire to expand outside Ukraine.

Burisma Holdings did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

While its owner is known for a high-flying lifestyle of luxury cars and excessive residences, Burisma operates in the quiet, non-descript shadows and only lists an address in Cyprus, where the company is registered.

According to Christopher Hartwell, current fellow and former president of the Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE) in Warsaw, registering in Cyprus is a common tactic of post-Soviet oligarchs.

“As Cyprus has some fantastic offshore tax benefits. It is the reason why Cyprus shows such high levels of foreign direct investment, which are really just piles of money passing through,” he explained. “It could be done to minimize tax liability, it could be done to access the European Union, or it could be done for money laundering. These are the top three reasons why Slavic companies register in Cyprus.”

Ukraine analysts also contend that while just about everything is in need of greater transparency – the country is rated 120 out of 180 of the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International – Hartwell stressed that “the energy trade has always been the worst.”

“The gas trade, for example, is how billions were siphoned off from the public and put into private hands, a problem which went on for years under government protection,” he continued. “Private energy firms are welcome in Ukraine as they provide much-needed competition against government monopolies, but given the heavy hand of government in every facet of energy, it’s still a too-cozy world with ample opportunities for corruption.”

Furthermore, Paraschiy pointed out that historically, [oil and gas] was a business of “people close to power, either central government or local governments.”

“We have some cases of private companies non-related to power brokers or oligarchs,” he said. “But, it is rather the exception.”

HAS JOSEPH MIFSUD RESURFACED? ALLEGED AUDIO OF MYSTERIOUS PROFESSOR EMERGES TWO YEARS AFTER DISAPPEARANCE

Another well-placed source connected to Ukraine’s energy industry, who requested anonymity, contended to Fox News that Biden came onto Burisma’s board “long after the questionable transactions occurred,” and the industry overall has made vast improvements in terms of corruption in recent years.

“Burisma did what many companies do all around the world. They hire people with recognition,” the source said. “Burisma is a legitimate producer of oil and gas, present on the new, liberalized market. We actively trade with them – buying and selling of gas – and they act in a professional, commercial manner.”

The insider commenced working with Burisma in 2014 soon after Biden joined the board but underscored that many were not personally aware he was even associated until it emerged in the press.

“I believe that my assistance in consulting the Company on matters of transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion and other priorities will contribute to the economy and benefit the people of Ukraine,” Biden wrote in a release soon after joining the Board in 2014.

Others beg to differ.

“By inviting influential foreigners, Ukrainian business wants to get additional protection, PR and lobby mechanisms to grasp additional spheres of interest. Having Hunter Biden on board, the owner of Burisma wanted to correct the image and to get cover, because authorities are scared by the U.S. embassy in Ukraine,” Egorov said. “Hunter Biden, using the political capabilities of his family, acted as a rescue buffer between Burisma and Ukrainian law enforcement agencies. His work in the company of a corrupt official smells bad.”

But by 2017, Burisma announced that it was not encountering any active prosecution cases. It then inked a partnership with the Washington think tank, the Atlantic Council, centered on combating corruption efforts in Ukraine.

And despite the investigations having been shuttered years ago, Burisma’s days of being probed are perhaps not yet behind them.

In October, the country’s prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, announced that his office would be reviewing the closed cases to ensure that they were appropriately handled – with the Burisma file still on the table. State Department official George Kent testified at the first public hearing of the House impeachment inquiry last week that, “since U.S. taxpayers are wasted,” he “would love to see the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office find who the corrupt prosecutor was that took the bribe and how much was paid.”"

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking the witnesses about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: ""Mr. Morrison, you were on that call, and there was no quid pro quo, correct? No bribery? No extortion?""

""Correct,"" Morrison replied in response to each question.

""And, Ambassador Volker, I presume you got a readout of the call. ... Was there any reference to withholding aid? Any reference to bribery? Any reference to quid pro quo? Any reference to extortion?""

""No, there was not,"" Volker replied, again and again.

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats as their impeachment inquiry continued into its second week of public hearings: With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years.

Morrison, in another key moment, testified Tuesday afternoon that he understood the transcript of Trump's call with Ukraine's leader wound up on a highly secured and classified computer system due to an ""administrative error"" -- not, as Democrats have alleged, because the president wanted to hide his conversation.

And, Volker testified repeatedly that he never received any indications at all that there was an improper quid pro quo with Ukraine, in which the Trump administration allegedly sought a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid.

As the hearing concluded, President Trump tweeted, ""A great day for Republicans, a great day for our Country!""

Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan told Fox News, ""This was a very good day for Republicans, for our president.""

""Kind of hard to prove a corrupt quid pro quo theory when the key U.S. policy people, plus the Ukrainians, were never aware of such an arrangement,"" Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw added late Tuesday, noting that Ukraine's president has said he felt no pressure from Trump to open any probes. ""Can we go back to governing now, that’d be great thanks.""

Morrison and Volker's testimony was sought by the GOP, and the two undercut Democrats' poll-tested claims of White House ""bribery"" and a cover-up. But, they also raised new questions concerning the administration's use of the little-discussed codeword-level system that ordinarily held sensitive national-security information. Back in September, a senior Trump administration official acknowledged that White House lawyers directed moving the transcript of the call to the secure system, noting that several of Trump's previous phone calls with foreign leaders had leaked to the media.

FLASHBACK: LEAK OF VERBATIM TRUMP CALL WITH AUSTRALIA LEADER PROMPTS WHITE HOUSE TO INCREASE SECURITY MEASURES

Morrison previously testified behind closed doors that senior NSC lawyer John Eisenberg had relayed to him that his secretary accidentally put the transcript in the classified system. Morrison said Eisenberg wanted to ""restrict access"" to the transcript, but maintained that the secretary had apparently misinterpreted that instruction.

""It was represented to me that it was a mistake,"" Morrison testified Tuesday, saying he tried to ""pull up the package in our system"" but was prevented from doing so. When he asked why the transcript was unavailable, he testified that he was ""informed it had been moved to the higher classification system"" at Eisenberg's direction. Then, Eisenberg told Morrison that he ""gave no such direction"" and that it was an ""administrative error,"" according to Morrison.

Morrison said to the best of his knowledge, there was no ""malicious intent"" in the decision to move the transcript to the compartmentalized system, and all essential personnel retained access to the transcript even after it was moved.

Later in the day, Volker made clear he had not seen anything to support Democrats' contention that Trump improperly withheld foreign aid to Ukraine as a means of forcing an investigation into the Bidens' dealings in the country.

Instead, Volker suggested -- in a moment that the Trump campaign reposted on social media -- that Trump's general hesitation to provide foreign aid, especially to corrupt countries, was the prevailing justification for holding up aid to Ukraine temporarily.

Asked again whether he saw any evidence that Trump had committed ""bribery"" -- the term Democrats have taken to using, after focus groups indicated that it would help them sell impeachment to voters -- Volker was unequivocal that he had not. In fact, Volker said, Trump never linked any probe of Burisma or the Bidens to any military aid. Hunter Biden sat on Burisma's board while his father spearheaded Ukraine policy as vice president.

""I have only seen an allegation of bribery in the last week,"" Volker said. ""I was never involved in anything that I considered to be bribery at all, or extortion.""

In one remarkable moment, Volker contradicted a media headline; asked about a Daily Mail story claiming he had ""walked back"" his testimony and had ""now learned"" there was a link between U.S. aid and Biden probe, Volker refuted the website outright.

Volker also said he didn't initially realize the connection between a Trump-sought investigation of Burisma and the Bidens, given that Burisma was seen as a symbol of Ukraine's endemic corruption problem.

Hunter Biden was a board member of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, which had been under investigation before then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in charge. In his call with Zelensky, Trump suggested the Ukrainians look into the circumstances of the prosecutor's termination, including Joe Biden's boast that he had the prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in critical aid. ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me,"" Trump said.

In a lengthy opening statement, Volker said he didn't have any problem with pushing Ukraine to open an investigation into Burisma or corruption.

""It has long been U.S. policy under multiple administrations to urge Ukraine to investigate and fight internal corruption,"" Volker said.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent similarly testified behind closed doors last month that he had qualms about Hunter Biden's lucrative role on the board of Burisma.

However, Volker said he felt a discussion of investigations was “inappropriate” in a July meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. officials at the White House. Volker confirmed others’ testimony that Trump's European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, raised the investigations “in a generic way,"" and that then-national security adviser John Bolton immediately ended the meeting.

The meeting happened two weeks before Trump’s momentous summer phone call with Zelensky.

Volker, who resigned in September after becoming embroiled in the scandal, added that he didn't ""understand"" at the time that an investigation of Burisma ""was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden.""

""I saw them as very different – the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable,"" Volker said. ""In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.""

Volker added: “The allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and non-credible.""

Volker went on to say that during a September dinner with top Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak, he’d discouraged Ukraine from trying to prosecute the country’s previous president. Volker says he warned it would sow deep societal divisions.

Volker said Yermak quipped in response, “You mean like asking us to investigate Clinton and Biden?” Volker claimed he didn’t “quite understand” the head-turning remark and was “kind of puzzled” by it.

Both Volker and Morrison previously gave closed-door interviews to the inquiry: Volker provided investigators with a package of text messages with Sondland and William Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires for Ukraine, who said he grew alarmed at the possible linkage of the investigations to the aid.

For his part, Morrison, who served as the NSC's senior director of European and Russian affairs, told lawmakers Trump didn't want tax dollars funding Ukrainian corruption and remarked that he wasn't concerned Trump's calls with Ukraine's leader were tied to his political interests.

Morrison resigned from the NSC last month. In his testimony Tuesday, he said he left on his ""own volition"" and made the decision ""before I decided to testify.""

The testimony from Volker and Morrison followed five hours of testimony earlier in the day with the NSC's Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Vice President Pence aide Jennifer Williams, who were each critical of Trump's conversation with Zelensky.

In a particularly remarkable moment, Vindman testified that he was asked to serve as Ukraine’s defense minister three times -- but repeatedly denied the offers -- when he traveled to Kiev for the inauguration of Ukraine's president. Oleksander Danylyuk, the former Chairman of the National Security and Defence Council in Ukraine, reportedly said on Tuesday the offer was ""clearly a joke.""

Among the biggest revelations Tuesday morning came when Vindman acknowledged communications with an unnamed intelligence official -- during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans, immediately raising apparent questions over whether he could have been a source of information for the anonymous whistleblower who reported the call.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., interjected to express concern that Republicans were trying to out the whistleblower through the questioning. After consulting his attorney, Vindman said, ""Per the advice of my counsel, I've been advised not to answer the specific questions about members of the intelligence community.""

Still, Vindman told lawmakers, ""I do not know who the whistleblower is.""

That claim didn't hold water with Republicans, and prompted Donald Trump Jr. to accuse Vindman of perjury. “I’d like them to be treated like I would be if I lied to Congress,"" he told Fox News late Tuesday.

On the whole, Vindman was largely critical of Trump's call with Zelensky, describing the investigation ""demand"" as ""improper."" At one point, Vindman described his reaction to Trump’s call as one of ""shock.""

""Frankly, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing,"" he testified. ""In certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out.""

However, Vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by Republican Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Vindman testified earlier in the day that he did not discuss his concerns about Trump's July phone call with Morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable.

But, under questioning from Wenstrup, Morrison confirmed that Vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that Vindman testified Morrison was unreachable.

""Frankly, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing."" — NSC's Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, concerning Trump's July call with Ukraine's leader

Arizona GOP Rep. Paul Gosar offered a blunt assessment of Vindman's testimony, tweeting: ""I think people need a reminder: the democrats said they would impeach starting in December 2016–before @realDonaldTrump was even sworn in. This is a hearing looking for a reason. It’s corrupt and immoral. The dude in the uniform is a seditionist.""

Morrison, meanwhile, also said he had heard others express concern that Vindman was a leaker, and could not be trusted with key information. Asked about that allegation, Vindman read from a glowing performance review that described him as an exemplary officer.

The other morning witness, Williams, also expressed concern about Trump's call with Zelensky, saying, ""I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.""

Until Tuesday, none of the witnesses who have testified at the public hearings had first-hand knowledge of the president's thinking, which Republicans have used to cast doubt on Democrats' allegations, but Vindman, Williams, and Morrison all listened in on Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky.

TRUMP SLAMS PELOSI AS 'GROSSLY INCOMPETENT' FOR TRADE DEAL HANDLING, CALLS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY A 'KANGAROO COURT'

Morrison said his understanding was that Trump generally was skeptical of foreign aid, and wanted to make sure that taxpayers were ""getting their money's worth.""

""The president was concerned that the United States seemed to bear the exclusive brunt of security assistance to Ukraine,"" Morrison said. ""He wanted to see the Europeans step up and contribute more security assistance.""

The impeachment inquiry has focused on a possible link between military aid to Ukraine and investigations sought by Trump pertaining to the Bidens and Democrats. The questions arose after the July 25 phone call led to a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine into helping him.

""As we have heard from other witnesses, when Joe Biden was considering whether to enter the race for the presidency in 2020, the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, began a campaign to weaken Vice President Biden’s candidacy by pushing Ukraine to investigate him and his son,"" Schiff said in his opening statement.

Nunes opened his remarks by welcoming people to ""Act Two of today's circus,"" dismissing the inquiry as a partisan exercise.

WATCH: VINDMAN CORRECTS CONGRESSMAN WHO DIDN'T USE HIS FORMAL MILITARY TITLE

""It's an ambitious attack to deprive the American people of their right to elect a president that the Democrats don’t like,"" Nunes said. ""The chairman of this committee claims that democracy is under threat. If that's true, it's not the president who poses the danger.""

Morrison, though, suggested the impeachment brouhaha was predictable partisan politics as usual.

""I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate,"" Morrison said in his opening statement. ""My fears have been realized.""

Col. Alexander Vindman testified in Tuesday's impeachment hearing that the omission of the word “Burisma” -- the Ukrainian natural gas firm that hired Hunter Biden to serve in a lucrative role on the board -- in the transcript of President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not “significant,” despite some prior controversy over the missing references.

Vindman, a director at the National Security Council, testified alongside Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Pence, as part of the House’s public phase of impeachment hearings. Both officials listened to Trump and Zelensky’s now-infamous phone call over the summer.

WHAT IS BURISMA HOLDINGS? THE STORY BEHIND THE SCANDAL-TIED UKRAINE FIRM THAT HIRED HUNTER BIDEN

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., asked both officials whether the name of the Ukrainian natural gas firm—Burisma Holdings—was mentioned on the call when Trump pressed Zelensky for an investigation into the Bidens and 2016 election meddling. Both confirmed that they heard the name Burisma on the call, but that it was missing from the transcript of the conversation that the White House released to the public in September.

Williams said she was “not involved in the production of the transcript,” so was unaware why the word Burisma was not included.

But Vindman attributed the omission, simply, “to the fact that this transcript being produced may have not caught the word Burisma.”

“It was in the transcript that was released as ‘the company,’ which is accurate,” Vindman said. “It’s not a significant omission.”

Vindman added that it was “informed speculation that the folks that produce these transcripts do the best they can, and they just didn’t catch the word.

“It was my responsibility to, then, make sure the transcript was as accurate as possible, and that’s what I attempted to do, by putting the word back in because it was in my notes,” he explained.

The testimony comes after his prior closed-door comments on the same issue made headlines weeks ago, with multiple articles flagging the omission of ""Burisma"" -- seemingly stirring Democrats' suspicion.

Schiff went on to question Vindman on his testimony behind closed doors, asking why he believed that Zelensky was “prepped” for the July 25 phone call—specifically on the topic of the Bidens and Burisma.

“It seemed unlikely that he would be familiar with a single company in the context of a call that was on the broader bilateral relationship,” Vindman said. “And it seemed to me he was either tracking this issue because it was in the press, or that he was otherwise prepared.”

EX-UKRAINE PROSECUTOR SAID HE WAS TOLD TO BACK OFF PROBE OF BIDEN-LINKED FIRM, FILES SHOW

When asked later about the omission of “Burisma” in the transcript, and ignoring some edits proposed by Vindman to the transcript before its release to the public, he said: “I didn’t see that as nefarious.”

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July phone call to Kiev. Trump pressed Zelensky, on the call, to open an investigation into the Bidens, specifically Hunter Biden's role on the board of Burisma, and former Vice President Joe Biden's role in pressuring former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the founder of the firm, Mykola Zlochevsky, the former minister of ecology and natural resources to Ukraine.

That call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a “quid pro quo” arrangement. Trump denies that."

Democrats' pivotal week of Trump impeachment hearings kicks off, as contradictions in testimony surface

Beginning Tuesday morning, in a rush of five public hearings ahead of the Thanksgiving recess, eight witnesses -- including several who have provided inconsistent accounts of key events -- are set to testify over three days in what could be a make-or-break week in House Democrats' impeachment investigation.

Less than 24 hours before the proceedings were set to be gaveled in Tuesday at 9 a.m. ET, President Trump floated the idea of testifying, rather than tweeting, during the inquiry. A top Republican called for a last-minute postponement, citing secretive new developments behind closed doors. And, the Trump campaign has pointed out apparent inconsistencies in some witness testimony already on the record.

A key impeachment figure: Though he's not slated to testify until Wednesday, the key witness expected to come up throughout the week is Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe.

Testifying Tuesday: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, is scheduled to testify Tuesday morning. He has testified behind closed doors that Sondland cited a discussion with White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney when pushing Ukrainian officials to open the investigations that Trump wanted into the 2016 U.S. presidential election and into potential 2020 election opponent Joe Biden.

National Security Council [NSC] official Tim Morrison, the outgoing senior director of European and Russian affairs and White House deputy assistant, is to testify Tuesday afternoon. In his closed-door deposition, which Democrats released over the weekend, Morrison said Trump didn't want tax dollars funding Ukrainian corruption, and remarked that he wasn't concerned Trump's calls with Ukraine's leader were tied to his political interests. Republicans have further noted that Morrison has testified privately that he ""had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s judgment"" and had heard concerns that Vindman was a leaker. Click here for more on our top story.

In other Trump impeachment inquiry developments: David Hale, the State Department’s No. 3 official, testified in a Nov. 6 closed-door deposition that no one in the Trump administration or any ""government channel"" ever mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter as a reason for withholding aid from Ukraine, according to a transcript of his remarks released late Monday by House Democrats in their impeachment inquiry. Hale is scheduled to testify publicly Wednesday.

Also late Monday, Democrats released testimony from State Department official David Holmes, who said in his Nov. 15 deposition that the conversation he overheard between Trump and Sondland during a lunch in Ukraine was so distinctive — even extraordinary — that nobody needed to refresh his memory. He is set to testify publicly Thursday.

Criminal charges expected against Epstein guards: report

Two correctional officers responsible for guarding Jeffrey Epstein when he took his own life are expected to face criminal charges this week for falsifying prison records, according to a report. The federal charges could come as soon as Tuesday, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The charges would be the first in connection with the death of Epstein, the wealthy financier who died Aug. 10 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York while awaiting trial on charges of sexually abusing teenage girls.

Meanwhile, on Monday, a woman who came forward with accusations of child sex abuse against Epstein described a disturbing encounter with the now-deceased sex offender, said she took former President Bill Clinton’s seat on the “Lolita Express,” and noted bizarre bedroom floors made of mattress foam and being encouraged to cry after sex with the disgraced money man.

Hong Kong police surround 100 protesters at university

About 100 anti-government protesters remained holed up at a Hong Kong university Tuesday as a police siege of the campus entered its third day. City leader Carrie Lam said 600 people had left the Hong Kong Polytechnic campus, including 200 who are under 18 years old. Police have surrounded the university and are arresting anyone who leaves. Groups of protesters made several attempts to escape Monday, including sliding down hoses to waiting motorcycles, but it wasn’t clear if they evaded arrest, according to the Associated Press.

Universities became the latest battleground last week in the Hong Kong protest movement, now in its fifth month

Obama on Friday warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls to pay attention to what voters actually think, claiming at a gathering of Democratic donors that most of them don’t want to “tear down the system” and that many Democrats “just don’t want to see crazy stuff.” Members of his party soon turned on him, using the hashtag #TooFarLeft.

“I’m #TooFarLeft because I want kids to be safe in school. I’m #TooFarLeft because I want people to live in dignity. I’m #TooFarLeft because I seek justice and equality. I’m #TooFarLeft because I think healthcare and housing are human rights,” tweeted former Hillary Clinton adviser Peter Daou, who started the hashtag.

Daou clarified Sunday evening that the slogan ""isn't primarily about Obama for me, though he was the catalyst for the tag.""

It quickly went viral, used by other liberal Democrats such as Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar.

Celebrities weighed in as well. Former “Two and a Half Men” star Jon Cryer claimed a ""far left"" position is necessary to counter an existential threat to humanity.

“I am #TooFarLeft because I believe that we cannot let greed cause the collapse of the ecosystem that supports all human life on earth,” he tweeted.

This is not the first time Obama has taken a stance against the leftward drift of the party or been on the receiving end of criticism for allegedly being too moderate.

During a discussion at the Obama Foundation Summit held at the Illinois Institute of Technology in October, Obama explained that the world is more complicated than people realize and urged politically active Americans to be practical if they want to be effective.

“This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said.

Several Democratic presidential candidates have taken veiled shots at Obama’s administration this year while targeting his former vice president, Joe Biden — especially regarding health care and immigration.

Over the summer, before he dropped out of the race, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said Biden should “absolutely” answer for the Obama administration’s deportation record.

According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg grabbed the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts were tied for second – with each at 15 percent.

The survey indicated Sen. Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – at 9 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota registered at 6 percent in the poll, with billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and grassroots organizer Tom Steyer at 5 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each were at 3 percent and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the survey stood at 1 percent or less.

The 37-year old Buttigieg – the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls – was once seen as the longest of long-shots for the nomination, but he surged in the spring to middle-tier status and he’s soared this autumn to reach the top-tier of contenders. He’s skyrocketed 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September.

Warren’s plunged 10 points since the previous poll, with Biden nose-diving 9 points.

“With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire’s Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

He’s not kidding. A Quinnipiac University Poll in New Hampshire conducted earlier this month indicated Biden at 20 percent, with Warren at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 15 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And, a University of New Hampshire-CNN poll conducted late last month showed Sanders at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Levesque emphasized that in the Saint Anselm poll, “Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76 percent having a favorable impression of him versus only 11 percent unfavorable.”

Buttigieg’s net favorability of 65 percent easily bested his top rivals for the nomination.

But, the reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent said they remained undecided and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters do change their minds, Warren may benefit. She topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.

The poll’s release came with two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary.

A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.

The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., jumped into the presidential nomination race. He stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.

The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid. Ninety-one percent said they would discourage 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from running again. But, more than four in ten said they would encourage former first lady Michelle Obama to run."

One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans.

Vindman said he spoke with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official, immediately raising apparent questions over whether he could have been a source of information for the anonymous whistleblower who reported the call. He said both individuals are ""cleared U.S. government officials with the appropriate need to know.”

RON JOHNSON CASTS DOUBT ON VINDMAN TESTIMONY, SAYS NSC OFFICIAL FITS 'PROFILE' OF NEVER-TRUMPER

Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., interjected to express concern that Republicans were trying to out the whistleblower through the questioning. After consulting his attorney, Vindman said, ""Per the advice of my counsel, I’ve been advised not to answer the specific questions about members of the intelligence community.""

Still, Vindman told lawmakers, “I do not know who the whistleblower is.”

The tension between Vindman and Republicans was evident after the revelation: at one point, when California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, called him “Mr. Vindman,” the witness replied, ""it's Lt. Col. Vindman.""

The impeachment inquiry has focused on a possible link between military aid to Ukraine and investigations sought by Trump pertaining to the Bidens and Democrats. The questions arose after a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky led to a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine into helping him.

At one point, Vindman described his reaction to Trump’s call as one of “shock.” “Frankly, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing,” he testified. “In certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out.”

Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ""demand"" and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it “would be interpreted as a partisan play.” He also emphasized that he reported his concerns “out of a sense of duty.”

The White House downplayed the hearing, though, as a debate over two individuals’ personal opinions about a call that Americans can read for themselves. During the hearing, Trump tweeted a video calling the inquiry a ""charade."" He also spoke to reporters at the White House, saying, ""Republicans are absolutely killing it. Because it’s a big scam.” He added: ""What’s going on is a disgrace.""

Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been “excluded” from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position. “I was concerned by the call. What I heard was inappropriate,” Vindman testified. He also said, “It is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent.”

In another revelation, Vindman said Oleksandr Danylyuk, Zelensky's former national security adviser, asked Vindman to be the defense minister in Ukraine on a number of occasions, including three times around the time of the inauguration.

Vindman called the request ""comical"" and said he didn't leave the door open on the offer. ""Every single time I dismissed it,"" he said, adding that he notified the chain of command back home.

Meanwhile, the other morning witness, Vice President Pence aide Jennifer Williams, also expressed concern about Trump's call with Zelensky, saying, “I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.” Williams, a State Department official assigned to Pence's office, said she inserted the White House's readout of the call in Pence's briefing book.

Both Vindman and Williams testified Tuesday they never learned why the hold on the military aid to Ukraine was eventually lifted.

In his opening remarks, the top Democrat on the panel, Schiff, defended both witnesses against recent attacks, telling Williams “we all saw the president’s tweet about you on Sunday afternoon” accusing her of being a “Never Trumper.” Williams later rejected that term, under questioning Tuesday.

When Vindman was asked if he's a ""Never Trumper,"" he described himself as ""Never partisan.""

Addressing Vindman -- who wore his Army uniform to Tuesday's hearing -- Schiff said, “I note that you have shed blood for America, and we owe you an immense debt of gratitude.” Vindman referenced his family’s history of moving from the Soviet Union to the United States 40 years ago, saying appearing for testimony in Russia would “surely cost me my life.” But addressing his father, Vindman said today, “Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.”

At another point, Vindman testified that he knew he was ""taking a risk"" by speaking about the Trump call. ""This is America. Here, right matters,"" he said to applause from some in the room.

Republicans on the committee dismissed the testimony, with Nunes calling the Democrat-led inquiry a “partisan frenzy"" while blasting the media coverage over what he called a ""fevered rush to tarnish and remove"" Trump. He referenced recent media reports that Democrats have shifted the wording they use to describe the allegations against the president from “quid pro quo” to “bribery” after conducting focus groups with voters. At the end of the hearing, he said there was ""no evidence"" presented for impeachment.

Republicans also lamented how Democrats won't grant their request to call the anonymous whistleblower who ignited the impeachment probe to testify to lawmakers. “Now that the whistleblower has successfully kickstarted impeachment, he has disappeared from the story—as if the Democrats put the whistleblower in their own witness protection program,” Nunes said.

GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, at another point, told Schiff ""no one believes"" him when he says he doesn't know who the whistleblower is.

Later Tuesday, two other witnesses will appear before lawmakers: former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker and NSC outgoing senior director of European and Russian affairs Tim Morrison.

WHAT IS BURISMA HOLDINGS? THE STORY BEHIND THE SCANDAL-TIED UKRAINE FIRM THAT HIRED HUNTER BIDEN

Vindman is viewed as a key witness for Democrats. In his testimony, Vindman has said he recalled U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland saying during White House meetings on July 10 that Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens to receive the aid.

Hunter Biden was a board member of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, which had been under investigation before then-Vice President Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in charge.

Until Tuesday, none of the witnesses who have testified at the public hearings had first-hand knowledge of the president's thinking, which Republicans have used to cast doubt on Democrats' allegations. But Vindman, Williams, and Morrison all listened in on Trump's July 25 phone call.

He has gone from a small town upbringing to become the inquisitor in chief for the Democrats’ effort to impeach President Trump.

While his home state of California can’t keep the lights on and while fires burn, Schiff could be found in front of every available camera since Trump took office, claiming to have evidence that the president had colluded with Russia in order to get elected. Despite Schiff’s constant promises to that effect, not even Special Counsel Robert Mueller could bail Schiff out of his false statements.

Russian conspiracies have now turned to Ukrainian stories – and once again Schiff is at the center of it all. After the abject media failures of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and the unfortunate death of Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Schiff finds himself right where he wants to be – in the spotlight on impeachment.

REP. LEE ZELDIN CALLS ADAM SCHIFF 'SICK,' SLAMS HIS 'DISGUSTING RHETORIC' ON IMPEACHMENT

The glare of the lights, however, has not convinced Schiff that he should run his impeachment inquiry in a just way with due process. Never in our history has there been such a one-sided inquiry in which only the chairman – and Schiff alone – decides what witnesses shall appear before his committee.

In the past, both parties had subpoena rights. Now, however, Republicans have been effectively denied the ability to counter the made-for-television story Schiff wants the country to believe about this president.

Moreover, Schiff and his partisan counsel felt free to ask their early witnesses questions about the activities of the former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter – apparently believing the Bidens would be exonerated.

Those witnesses indicated concerns about the actions of Hunter Biden and exposed the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into the Ukrainian natural gas company that was paying Hunter Biden to serve on its board at the time Joe Biden got the prosecutor in charge of the investigation fired. But Schiff is refusing to allow Republicans to call witnesses to delve deeper into that story. This is politics folks – not justice.

Schiff is also covering for the so-called whistleblower. Schiff claims it is for the safety of that person. However, it is more likely Schiff is concerned with his own possibly illegal activity.

The law requires any so-called whistleblower from the intelligence community (where the whistleblower on Ukraine has been reported as working) to submit his or her complaint to the director of national intelligence before meeting with any congressional staff – in this case, staffers working for Schiff.

The purpose of the law is simple. The director of national intelligence, who deals with national security, should receive unvarnished information – not politically motivated stories.

That didn’t happen. Instead, the so-called whistleblower met with Schiff’s people and was coached before making his complaint to the director of national intelligence. That could well be a crime and Schiff is obstructing any inquiry into that crime. Not only that, Schiff patently lied about his committee’s early contact with the so-called whistleblower – also a form of obstruction of justice.

I should note that Schiff isn’t ignoring California altogether. To the contrary, rather than attend one of the secret depositions of witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, Schiff jetted to California last weekend to give a speech at the California Democratic Convention.

Given the miscarriage of justice Schiff has undertaken over the last years, it was no surprise that, in front of the cameras, Schiff claimed Trump was a “charlatan.”

There was one surprise in his invective, however. Schiff proclaimed the following: “We will send that charlatan in the White House back to the golden throne he came from …. And you know why? Because we vote. How do we build another big, beautiful wave? We vote.”

Think about that statement.

Clearly, Schiff knows that this inquiry he is running – which is firmly undemocratic and violates due process – is going nowhere, and neither is President Trump. Schiff knows the Senate will reject this latest resistance to the results of the 2016 election. It also means that Schiff knows this impeachment inquiry is just a political exercise meant to get attention for himself and to motivate Democratic voters in the 2020 elections.

The irony of Adam Schiff is that the congressional seat Schiff he holds had been previously occupied by Rep. James Rogan – one of the managers of the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Rogan had been targeted for defeat by Democrats because of the role he played in that impeachment.

Given the constitutional implications of his acts, and the damage being done to the Republic by Schiff and his cohorts, the one person who should be targeted for defeat in 2020 is Adam Schiff.

The decision by the California Democrat and House Intelligence Committee chairman to conduct the first series of interviews behind closed doors allowed Republicans to appropriately brand the enterprise as unfair and clandestine.

His next step, orchestrating a steady stream of leaks and disclosures timed and edited for maximum impact, all but guaranteed that last week’s subsequent live hearings would be anti-climactic.

Schiff stole his own thunder.

JASON CHAFFETZ: WHY SCHIFF'S WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS AT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARING ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE

In addition, he has not been straightforward about his dealings with the whistleblower, who initially was pivotal to charges against the president but who is now deemed inconsequential by Schiff.

It is common knowledge that the initial complaint was launched by a Democrat with ties to President Trump’s adversaries. That revelation has sucked even more legitimacy from the investigation.

As a result of these several missteps, the public is wary of what has emerged as an obviously partisan attack on a duly elected president. Worse, they are also, already, bored and, we’re not even in the home stretch.

If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Adding to the public’s ennui is that the resolution of the impeachment is a foregone conclusion. It’s like Agatha Christie revealing whodunit in Chapter One; it steals the story’s punch.

We know Democrats will press forward with their tiresome questioning and posturing, hoping to convince the nation that the hearings are something bigger and nobler than a political stunt. They will vote to impeach; that has always been a foregone conclusion.

The carnival will then move to the Senate, which will ultimately hold a trial and find the president not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats know this; they know there is no real purpose to their impeachment thrust but to undermine Mr. Trump before the 2020 campaign.

It's a risky way to win an election. If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Also, a partisan investigation will energize Trump supporters and drive turnout among Republicans.

Even the Trump-hating New York Times struggled to find much meaning in the impeachment proceedings. In their coverage of the first day of hearings, reporter Peter Baker was reduced to glorifying star witness and diplomat William Taylor’s appearance: “the image, at least, of a wise, fatherly figure” with a “chiseled face and reassuring gray hair” whose “deep baritone voice [was] reminiscent of Walter Cronkite.” Channeling Gregory Peck apparently enhances Taylor’s credibility.

The liberal media did hyperventilate over Taylor’s “new” revelation that someone on his staff “asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine.” Sondland, according to the aide, according to Taylor, said the president “cares more about the investigations of Bidens.” In other words, third-hand hearsay.

Disappointing to Democrats, Taylor refused to climb aboard the impeachment train. Moreover, that Taylor had never once met with or talked to President Trump undermined the impact of his testimony, notwithstanding his admirable elocution.

To be sure, it is clear that Taylor disapproved of President Trump’s reportedly tying $391 million in aid to Kiev to an investigation into possible misdeeds by Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He said that holding up that assistance for political purposes is wrong. It is unclear what Taylor thought of President Obama’s steadfast refusal to authorize that much-needed help during his administration.

Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was sent back to the United States because the White House heard she was openly critical of the president, was not even in the Ukraine when the events under review took place. The president is entitled to have representatives in foreign countries who are on his team. End of story.

Taylor, Yovanovitch and other witnesses, including the still missing-in-action whistleblower, have no first-hand evidence that Trump threatened to withhold aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens. That is still a critical missing link.

As the inquiry drags on, more Americans will tune out. The TV audience on the first day of the Schiff show was far less than the number who watched the confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or even Michael Cohen’s testimony.

Schiff himself was tweeting his followers to watch in an embarrassing effort to gin up enthusiasm. The audience will shrink further.

Democratic candidates slugging it out in Iowa and New Hampshire are rarely asked about impeachment. Instead, voters ask about health care and other issues; campaigners are struggling to explain how they are rewarding voters for giving their party the majority in the House.

Some of those candidates will soon view the impeachment drive as an even bigger threat. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker – all 2020 candidates – will have to participate in the eventual Senate trial. That means they will have to sit in the Senate day after day, while rivals like Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg run circles around them on the campaign trail.

It is almost inconceivable that Democrats have allowed Adam Schiff to play ringmaster for this circus. As a major author of the Russia collusion narrative, Schiff was already reviled on the right.

As he leads his own party down the impeachment rabbit hole, Schiff may come under fire from Democrats as well, and especially from those senators trying to win the primaries.

And let’s not forget the damage Schiff has done to front-runner Joe Biden. After all, the one critical part of the Ukraine story that is regurgitated with each telling is that Biden’s son Hunter monetized his father’s unique status not only in Kiev but also in China. That has soiled the former vice president’s candidacy.

The hearings are not over but it is hard to see today how impeachment will prove a winner for Democrats. Nancy Pelosi should have stuck to her guns, and never let this process move forward, and especially with Adam Schiff at the helm.

Less than 24 hours before the proceedings are set to be gaveled in at 9 a.m. ET, President Trump floated the idea of testifying, rather than tweeting, during the inquiry. A top Republican called for a last-minute postponement, citing secretive new developments behind closed doors. And, the Trump campaign has pointed out apparent inconsistencies in some testimony already on the record.

The key witness to focus on amid the rapid-fire series of developments is likely to be Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, the wealthy donor who has bragged about his proximity to President Trump -- and who repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Though he won't testify until Wednesday, Sondland will loom large in Tuesday morning's proceedings.

DEM WITNESS ADMITS HE BLABBED ABOUT OVERHEARD TRUMP CALL, CALLS IT 'LIKE, AN EXTRAORDINARY THING'

In part, that's because Sondland previously testified behind closed doors that Trump directly told him there were to be ""no quid pro quos of any kind"" with Ukraine, and that he didn’t recall any conversations with the White House about withholding military assistance in return for Ukraine helping with the president’s political campaign. Democrats have alleged that Trump held up the aid to ensure a public probe into the Ukraine business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Then, William Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires for Ukraine, told lawmakers that Sondland himself said ""everything"" — a White House visit for Ukraine's new leader and the release of military aid to the former Soviet republic — was contingent on a public announcement of investigations into the 2016 election and into Ukraine gas company Burisma. (Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board of Burisma, despite having little relevant experience, while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president.)

Weeks later, after testimony from Taylor and National Security Council [NSC] official Tim Morrison placed him at the center of key discussions, Sondland suddenly amended his testimony and claimed his recollection had been ""refreshed."" Sondland said he now could recall a September conversation in which he told an aide to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that military aid likely would not occur until Ukraine made public announcements about corruption investigations. Sondland said he came to ""understand"" that arrangement from other sources.

Morrison, the NSC's outgoing senior director of European and Russian affairs and White House deputy assistant, is to testify Tuesday afternoon. In his closed-door deposition, which Democrats released over the weekend, Morrison said Trump didn't want tax dollars funding Ukrainian corruption, and remarked that he wasn't concerned Trump's calls with Ukraine's leader were tied to his political interests.

'CANNOT BE TRUE' -- MAJOR INCONSISTENCY EMERGES IN BILL TAYLOR'S TESTIMONY

Additionally, Sondland has insisted he knew acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney only well enough to wave and say hello — and that’s about it. He said he may have spoken to him once or twice on the phone, but not about Ukraine. Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, has testified Sondland cited a discussion with Mulvaney when pushing Ukrainian officials to open the investigations that Trump wanted into the 2016 U.S. presidential election and into potential 2020 election opponent Joe Biden.

Vindman is scheduled to testify Tuesday morning. Republicans have further noted that Morrison has testified privately that he ""had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s judgment"" and had heard concerns that Vindman was a leaker.

Separately, Fiona Hill, another White House national security official, said Sondland often talked of meetings with Mulvaney. In a further link between the two men, she quoted the-then National Security Adviser John Bolton as telling her he didn’t want to be part of “whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney were cooking up.”

Hill is to testify Thursday morning, after Sondland's appearance.

She also has recalled scolding Sondland face-to-face after tense July 10 meetings at the White House involving U.S. and Ukrainian leaders, reminding him of the need for proper procedures and the role of the National Security Council. She said Bolton ""stiffened"" when Sondland brought up investigations in front of the Ukrainian officials and immediately ended the meeting. Vindman, too, said he made clear to Sondland his comments were inappropriate ""and that we were not going to get involved in investigations.""

But, Sondland said he didn't recall a cross word from Hill, Bolton or anyone else about his Ukraine work. In fact, he said, Bolton signed off on the whole Ukraine strategy.

""Indeed, over the spring and summer of 2019, I received nothing but cordial responses from Ambassador Bolton and Dr. Hill. Nothing was ever raised to me about any concerns regarding our Ukrainian policy,"" Sondland said. When Hill left her post in government, he recalled, she gave him a big hug and told him to keep in touch.

GOP REP CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS TO BE POSTPONED IMMEDIATELY, CITING NEW DEVELOPMENTS

Testimony from multiple witnesses has centered on the July 10 White House meetings. Several of those present said Sondland, on that day, explicitly connected a coveted White House visit to the country’s public announcement of corruption investigations. It was something he just “blurted out,” Hill said, recalling him saying: ""Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff for a meeting if these 'investigations in the energy sector start.""

Vindman, too, said he remembered Sondland saying that day that the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens.

But, Sondland told a different version of the day. He said he didn’t recall mentioning Ukraine investigations or Burisma. The only conflict he described from that day was a disagreement on whether to schedule a call between Trump and Zelensky promptly. He was in favor.

Sondland likely won't be the only witness in the impeachment inquiry facing credibility concerns this week. Late Monday, the Trump campaign pointed out that State Department official David Holmes' testimony concerning Trump's call with Sondland -- in which Trump allegedly called for ""investigations"" -- seemed to conflict with Taylor's remarks under oath.

Taylor, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee last Wednesday, said he had just learned about the July phone call this month. But, Holmes' timeline of events, according to a written statement from his closed-door interview, seemed to depart from Taylor's -- saying he notified Taylor of the call shortly after it happened.

Holmes is slated to testify Thursday. Late Monday, Democrats released testimony from Holmes' Nov. 15 closed-door deposition in which he stated that the phone call he overheard between Trump and Sondland during a lunch in Ukraine was so distinctive — even extraordinary — that nobody needed to refresh his memory.

""I've never seen anything like this,"" Holmes told House investigators, ""someone calling the president from a mobile phone at a restaurant, and then having a conversation of this level of candor, colorful language. There's just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly.""

Holmes also testified that he told ""a number of friends of mine"" about the call because it was ""like, a really extraordinary thing"" to be ""part of"" a lunch in which ""someone called the president."" He insisted he didn't go into detail about the call while he boasted about it, but estimated that he may have told as many as six friends.

""It was, like, a really extraordinary thing."" — State Department official David Holmes, on overhearing Trump's call with Gordon Sondland in a restaurant

For his part, Trump has insisted Democrats had been out to get him any way they could. The president has noted, for example, that The Washington Post discussed the push to impeach Trump just minutes after he took office in 2017 -- and, the Ukraine whistleblower's lawyer openly called for a ""coup"" and impeachment around the same time. Prominent Democrats, including Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, rang in 2019 with colorful vows to impeach Trump.

House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., sent a letter Monday to the panel's chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., panning what he called the ""Democrat impeachment crusade"" for lacking the ""due process protections afforded in all past presidential impeachments, including those protections afforded to President Clinton by Republicans.""

Collins continued, ""It is an unfair process for many other reasons, chief among them the fact that minority questions are not being answered in depositions and the president’s counsel has had no voice in the fact-gathering phase of this impeachment inquiry.""

WHY IS SONDLAND WORRYING BOTH DEMS AND GOP?

For his part, Trump revealed Monday he was considering an invitation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to provide his own account to the House, possibly by submitting written testimony. That would be an unprecedented moment in this constitutional showdown between the two branches of U.S. government.

Trump tweeted: “Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!”

But, a Democratic official working on the impeachment probe told Fox News on Monday that they weren't taking the offer seriously.

""If President Trump were serious about providing information to our investigation, he’d stop obstructing his administration from providing documents and people to provide testimony,"" the official said. ""There are people who could testify, including John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney. This is not serious. We're not going to play that game.""

Tuesday’s sessions at the House Intelligence Committee are to start with Vindman, an Army officer at the National Security Council, and Jennifer Williams, his counterpart at Vice President Mike Pence’s office.

The witnesses, both foreign policy experts, said they listened with concern as Trump spoke on July 25 with the newly elected Ukraine president. The government whistleblower’s complaint about that call led the House to launch the impeachment investigation.

Vindman and Williams said they were uneasy as Trump talked to Zelensky about investigations of the Bidens. Vindman also said he reported the call to NSC lawyers.

Williams said she found it ""unusual"" and inserted the White House's readout of it in Pence's briefing book.

""I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen,"" Vindman said, adding there was ""no doubt"" what Trump wanted.

WATCH: BANNON SAYS HE PUSHED FOR ALLEGED WHISTLEBLOWER TO BE OUSTED FROM NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, CITING LEAK CONCERNS

Pence's role remained unclear. ""I just don't know if he read it,"" Williams testified in a closed-door House interview.

Vindman also lodged concerns about Sondland, relaying details from the explosive July 10 meeting at the White House and saying the ambassador pushed visiting Ukraine officials for the investigations Trump wanted.

""He was talking about the 2016 elections and an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma,"" Vindman testified.

Morrison referred to Burisma as a ""bucket of issues"" -- the Bidens, Democrats, investigations -- from which he had tried to ""stay away.""

Along with Volker's testimony, their accounts further complicated Sondland’s testimony and characterized Trump as more central to the action.

Sondland met with a Zelensky aide on the sidelines of a Sept. 1 gathering in Warsaw, Poland, and Morrison, who was watching the encounter from across the room, testified that the ambassador told him moments later he pushed the Ukrainian for the Burisma investigation as a way for Ukraine to gain access to the military funds.

WH OFFICIAL SUES POLITICO, TARGETS SCHIFF'S ROLE IN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS

Volker provided investigators with a package of text messages with Sondland and Taylor, who said he grew alarmed at the possible linkage of the investigations to the aid.

Republicans are certain to mount a more aggressive attack on all the witnesses as the inquiry has reached closer into the White House.

The president has aimed to see a robust defense by his GOP allies on Capitol Hill, but so far they have offered a changing strategy as the fast-moving probe spilled into public view.

Republicans first complained the witnesses were offering only hearsay, without first-hand knowledge of Trump’s actions. But, as more witnesses came forward bringing testimony closer to Trump, they more recently have said the president was innocent because the military money eventually was released.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., during an appearance Monday in Louisville, Kentucky, acknowledged the House will likely vote to impeach the president.

But, the GOP leader said he ""can't imagine"" a scenario in which there would be enough support in the Senate -- a supermajority 67 votes -- to remove Trump from office.

McConnell said House Democrats ""are seized with 'Trump derangement syndrome,'"" a catch-phrase used by the president's supporters. He said the inquiry seemed ""particularly ridiculous since we're going into the presidential election and the American people will have an opportunity in the very near future to decide who they want the next president to be.""

Pelosi, though, said the president could speak for himself.

""If he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it,"" she said in a CBS News interview that aired Sunday. Trump ""could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants,"" she said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump ""should come to the committee and testify under oath, and he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath."" He said the White House's insistence on blocking witnesses from cooperating raised the question: ""What is he hiding?""

The White House has instructed officials not to appear, and most have received congressional subpoenas to compel their testimony.

Those appearing in public already have given closed-door interviews to investigators, and transcripts from those depositions largely have been released.

Sondland is to appear Wednesday. The wealthy hotelier, who donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, was the only person interviewed to date who had direct conversations with the president about the Ukraine situation.

Morrison said Sondland and Trump had spoken about five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 — the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released.

Trump has said he barely knew Sondland.

Besides Sondland, the committee is set to hear Wednesday from Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, and David Hale.

Hale, the State Department’s No. 3 official, testified in a Nov. 6 closed-door deposition that no one in the Trump administration or any ""government channel"" ever mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter as a reason for withholding aid from Ukraine, according to a transcript of his remarks released late Monday by House Democrats.

Hale said he saw the Bidens referenced only in media reports -- as well as in a ""speculative"" email from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who testified last week. Hale is scheduled to testify publicly Wednesday.

“She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” he continued.

The president’s tweet comes after Pelosi, D-Calif., challenged him to testify before Congress if he wants to set the record straight.

“The president could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants. He has every opportunity to present his case,” Pelosi said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Pelosi extended the invitation ahead of a week that is expected to be jam-packed with witness testimony in the impeachment inquiry. Pelosi said lawmakers would “look forward” to seeing any information from Trump “that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also echoed the suggestion.

“If Donald Trump doesn’t agree with what he’s hearing, doesn’t like what he’s hearing, he shouldn’t tweet,” Schumer said. “He should come to the committee and testify under oath. And he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath.""

The challenge was paired with Pelosi's warning not to go after the whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry — though Democrats initially had indicated that the whistleblower could testify, only to back off and now urge Trump to testify instead.

""I will make sure he does not intimidate the whistleblower,"" Pelosi said. ""I told the president you're in my wheelhouse when you come after the whistleblower.""

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

On the call, Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement.

Speier pressed Vindman on whether or not those actions could be construed as retaliation against him.

""So in some respects, then, there have been reprisals?"" she inquired.

Vindman responded: ""I'm not sure if I can make that judgment. I can say it was out of the course of normal affairs to not have me participate in some of these events.""

Democrats have drawn attention to what they characterize as unfair treatment of former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch by Trump and his associates, including alleged ""intimidation"" when Trump live-tweeted criticism during her appearance in a public hearing on Friday.

The claim that Vindman is being left out of meetings could be used by Democrats to build their case that the Trump administration is attempting to prevent potential witnesses from cooperating with the inquiry.

Tuesday’s sessions at the House Intelligence Committee started with Vindman and Williams, both foreign policy experts who previously said they listened with concern as Trump spoke on July 25 with the newly elected Ukraine president. An intelligence community whistleblower’s complaint about that call led the House to launch the impeachment investigation, which was eventually formalized in a resolution passed before the beginning of public hearings last week.

Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Burisma Holdings and a widely challenged conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 elections against Trump. Burisma is a Ukranian gas company that 2020 Democratic contender Joe Biden's son, Hunter, previously worked for as a board member. Biden had little known qualifications to hold such a position. The senior Biden, while vice president, later demanded the removal of a prosecutor who was looking into Burisma, although that came after the Burisma investigation was closed.

Democrats have accused Trump of withholding an Oval Office meeting and almost $400 million in military aid from Zelensky as leverage to persuade him to pursue those investigations, which would have been politically beneficial to Trump.

Former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and Tim Morrison, who was previously the top advisor on the National Security Council handling Russian and European affairs, will testify in another public impeachment hearing Tuesday in the second session of a week that will see nine witnesses testify over five hearings.

Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed all of this in a July 25 phone call, around which Ukrainegate revolves.

Consider the following statements:

“I know what the conversation was about, and I think there was no pressure,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told the Hromadske news outlet Sept. 21. “This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.”

“Nobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent state,” Zelensky told Russia’s Rossiya 24 news channel Sept. 25 at the United Nations General Assembly. “The only one person by the way who can put pressure on me ... is my son, who is 6 years old.”

“Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky told journalists at a joint appearance that afternoon with Trump at the U.N.

“I’m telling you – no, there was no such connection,” between military aid and investigations, a senior Ukrainian official told Time magazine Sept. 25.

“I was never pressured and there were no conditions being imposed” on military assistance or a meeting between Zelensky and Trump, Ukraine’s president told Kyodo News Oct. 5.

“There was no pressure or blackmail from the U.S.,” Zelensky said in Kiev during an Oct. 10 “press marathon” with some 300 journalists who took turns interviewing him in small groups. “This call influenced only one thing. We needed to secure a meeting, that it was necessary to meet with the president,” he said. “I wanted to show him our team, our young team. I wanted to get him into Ukraine.”

“I had no idea the military aid was held up” at the time of the call with Trump, Zelensky said Oct. 10. Much like making a bomb threat while staying silent about the explosive device, it would have been tough for Trump to bribe or extort Zelensky without informing him that this security relief had been paused to ascertain whether Zelensky would keep his anti-corruption campaign promises. Kiev learned about this delay in late August. Zelensky and Vice President Mike Pence discussed this in Warsaw on Sept. 1. The assistance was released 10 days later.

“And after this meeting, the U.S. unlocked the aid and added $140 million,” Zelensky said. “That’s why there was no blackmail.”

“I’m against corruption,” Zelensky told ABC News’ Tom Llamas Oct. 10. “This is not corruption, it was just a call.” Zelensky also said: “This has nothing to do with weapons and the Burisma situation.” He added: “There was no blackmail. It was not the subject of our conversation.”

“There was no blackmail,” Zelensky said Oct. 10. “We are not servants. We are an independent country.”

“Our calls were not linked to Burisma or military aid,” Zelensky also said on Oct. 10.

“Ambassador Sondland did not tell us, and certainly did not tell me, about a connection between the assistance and the investigations,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said Nov. 14 about Gordon Sondland, America’s emissary to the European Union. “I have never seen a direct relationship between investigations and security assistance,” Prystaiko said, according to Interfax Ukraine. “Yes, the investigations were mentioned, you know, in the conversation of the presidents. But there was no clear connection between these events.”

IMPEACHMENT PROBE DRAWS IN TRUMP’S ANSWERS TO MUELLER

NYT: “Impeachment investigators are exploring whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Robert S. Mueller III during the Russia investigation, a lawyer for the House told a federal appeals court on Monday, raising the prospect of bringing an additional basis for a Senate trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. … During the Mueller investigation, Mr. Trump refused to testify orally about what he knew and did during the 2016 campaign in relation to Russia’s election interference operation, or his later efforts to impede the special counsel’s inquiry. But he did provide lawyerly written answers to some questions, which were appended to the Mueller report. On Monday, Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court panel that impeachment investigators have an ‘immense’ need to see the grand jury evidence — redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the underlying testimony transcripts they came from — because Mr. Trump may have lied.”



Ukrainian president reportedly felt the pressure long before Trump’s squeeze - AP: “Despite his denials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden before his July phone call with President Donald Trump that has led to impeachment hearings. In early May, staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were briefed on a meeting Zelenskiy held in which he sought advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, according to two people with knowledge of the briefings. He was concerned that Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race, the people said. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.”



Trump defenders’ new stance: The quid pro quo failed - NYT: “House Republicans, bracing for another week of impeachment hearings, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition… [L]awmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld — but later released — $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. … On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of ‘Fox News Sunday,’ pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might ‘blow a hole’ in Republicans’ defense. ‘The president’s defense is that those things didn’t happen,’ Mr. Scalise said, adding: ‘The real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.’”



In a murky sea of disinformation and bias, voters tune out - NYT: “The Democrats in Congress took their case against President Trump to the public last week. But after hours of testimony, thousands of news reports and days of streaming headlines, one thing was clear: A lot of Americans weren’t listening. … In this volatile political moment, information, it would seem, has never been more crucial. The country is in the midst of impeachment proceedings against a president for the third time in modern history. A high-stakes election is less than a year away. But just when information is needed most, to many Americans it feels most elusive. The rise of social media; the proliferation of information online, including news designed to deceive; and a flood of partisan news are leading to a general exhaustion with news itself. Add to that a president with a documented record of regularly making false statements and the result is a strange new normal: Many people are numb and disoriented, struggling to discern what is real in a sea of slant, fake and fact.”



Trump reportedly vexed by Pompeo’s failure to rein in diplomats - NBC News: “The impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to four current and former senior administration officials. Trump has fumed for weeks that Pompeo is responsible for hiring State Department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency, the officials said. The president confronted Pompeo about the officials – and what he believed was a lackluster effort by the secretary of state to block their testimony – during lunch at the White House on Oct. 29, those familiar with the matter said. Inside the White House, the view was that Trump ‘just felt like, ‘rein your people in,’’ a senior administration official said. Trump particularly blames Pompeo for tapping Ambassador Bill Taylor in June to be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the current and former senior administration officials said.”

Atlantic: “Clothes, in [the Netflix series] The Crown, have always been part of the aesthetic pleasure the show provides viewers—a crucial element of the absurd spectacle that is royalist Britain… And yet, watching Season 3 [released Nov. 17], [The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert noticed] more than ever how the series uses clothing to explore and subvert ideas about power, and what it looks like when a woman wields it. … [Queen Elizabeth’s] gender, and her femininity, are intrinsic to the way she governs.… In reality, as in the show, the Queen’s deployment of pastel colors and pearls isn’t just a matter of personal taste. Since her coronation in 1953, when the Queen requested that her gown for the event be embroidered with symbols from countries in the British Commonwealth … every outfit she’s worn has been worn with intention. Clothing, for the Queen, is much more about diplomacy and visibility than style.”

BUTTI-BOOM, BUTTI-BING

Des Moines Register: “Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”



Biden strikes cautious tone on pot - WaPo: “On the question of marijuana, former vice president Joe Biden might seem out of step with the crowd. … But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released Nov. 14. This disparity on the topic came into full view at a town hall in Las Vegas over the weekend, when Biden drew some groans from the crowd by saying he wants to see more research on marijuana and suggesting that it may be a ‘gateway drug’ that can lead users to harsher substances.”



Harry Reid credits Biden’s Nevada success to minority appeal - AP: “Iowa and New Hampshire get to weigh in first on the Democratic presidential contest next year, but the states are not ethnically diverse enough to offer any insight into how a candidate will fare across the country, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday. … Reid said he thinks that former Vice President Joe Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”



As Harris craters, blame game ramps up - Politico: “Kamala Harris’ campaign is careening toward a crackup. As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. … The internal strife is the latest discouraging development for Harris’ once-encouraging candidacy. She has slid into low single digits and is now banking on a top-tier performance in Iowa to pull her back into contention. Inside the campaign, which had already experienced staff shakeups before the layoffs, rank and file aides are fed up with the weak leadership and uncertainty around internal communication, planning and executing on a clear vision. They say the constant shifting has eroded trust in the upper ranks.”



Pressure rises at home for speedy exit - Politico: “Harris’ loyal activist base, who call themselves the K-Hive, have lost none of the passion and intensity from those early days. … But in the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”



Warren’s Medicare hedge does little to quell doubts - WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been mostly sure-footed in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. One exception is health care. On Friday, she issued another proposal to go along with her support for Medicare-for-all, a step that appeared designed to put her into a safer place politically. Warren’s progression on health care through the course of the campaign has taken her from a position of flexibility to one of seeming inflexibility — at least until Friday. Over a period of months, she walked herself into a place that many Democrats feared could make her chances of winning a general election more, not less, difficult. Whether Friday’s turn alleviates those worries remains to be seen.”



Younger voters still dig Bernie - WBUR: “Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders remains the top choice for young likely voters, coming in at 28% in the [Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters under age 30]. That's down 3 percentage points since the spring. The 78-year-old Sanders has long had strong support among the under-30 set. [Twenty-two percent of likely 18- to 29-year-old voters would choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary. That’s up 18 points from her showing in March.] Another septuagenarian, former Vice President Joe Biden, comes in third in the Harvard survey, with the backing of 16% of likely voters. The youngest Democratic candidate, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is fifth, at just 4%.”



Bloomberg continues apology tour - Fox News: “Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has yet to formally announce whether he will run for president in 2020, but during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, he apologized for his controversial ‘stop and frisk’ policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration. That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his Sunday speech, Bloomberg recognized that this led to ‘far too many innocent people’ being stopped, many of them black or Latino. ‘I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong.’”



Lefties see conspiracy behind Patrick, Bloomberg runs - Politico: “Democratic donors say they want Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick to run for president because they’re petrified that a left-wing candidate can’t defeat President Donald Trump. But progressives see a more sinister effort afoot. Aides and allies to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among other liberals, perceive the eleventh-hour campaign launched last week by Patrick — and the prospect of an impending Bloomberg 2020 bid — as an attempt to crush an ascendant left wing that would expand government more than any other Democratic president in decades. In their view, Patrick and Bloomberg are stalking horses for moderate Democrats, high-dollar contributors and bundlers desperate to halt the momentum of the economic populists at the top of the polls — and regain control of the party levers.”



Can anyone break the Coolidge curse? - NYT: “Voters have never elected a sitting mayor to the presidency. Americans have seldom embraced anyone who’s even touched the job. Calvin Coolidge was the last president, one of just three in 230 years, to have been a mayor at any point. He led Northampton, Mass. – a modest town, really – for two years. But as the Democratic Party becomes ever more aligned with urban areas, its presidential field is now studded with politicians whose boasts include running a city. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has now jumped to the lead in Iowa polling. Also in the race are two recent mayors, Julián Castro and Cory Booker, and another candidate who got his start as a mayor, Bernie Sanders. The current New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and a former Denver mayor, John Hickenlooper, have already come and gone, while Michael Bloomberg, another New York mayor, is still calculating on the sidelines.”



TRUMP CRAPS OUT ON GUBERNATORIAL GAMBLES

Politico: “President Donald Trump campaigned hard in three conservative Southern states this fall, aiming for a string of gubernatorial wins that would demonstrate his political strength heading into impeachment and his own reelection effort. The plan backfired in dramatic fashion. The latest black eye came on Saturday, when Trump's favored candidate in Louisiana, multimillionaire businessman Eddie Rispone, went down to defeat. The president went all-in, visiting the state three times, most recently on Thursday. Earlier this month, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost reelection after a similar presidential effort on his behalf. Of the candidates Trump backed, only Tate Reeves in Mississippi won. The losses raise questions about Trump’s standing as he heads into what will be a grueling 2020 campaign. By throwing himself into the three contests — each in states that Trump won by double-digits in 2016 — the president had hoped to gain a modicum of political momentum at a perilous moment of his presidency.”

DEEP YOGURT

USA Today: “[Patricia] Larkin, of Lacey, New Jersey, said in the Facebook group ‘Lacey Township Chatter’ that she was grocery shopping with her infant when a woman told a cashier that her baby was fake and an attempt to ‘smuggle yogurts out of the store.’ Larkin, despite being fatigued from staying up nights with her 2-month-old daughter, responded to the accusation with humor. She posted a picture of herself smiling while holding her sleeping baby in front of the store's sign. ‘Thank you for the laugh,’ she wrote in the Facebook group. ‘1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all.’ Larkin said a similarly amused cashier told her about the woman's accusation, by which time, her infant daughter was crying and fussing like only a real baby could.”

Taylor, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee last Wednesday, said he had just learned about the July phone call this month.

EMBASSY OFFICIAL SAYS HE HEARD ABOUT TRUMP-SONDLAND CALL ABOUT UKRAINE 'INVESTIGATIONS'

But Holmes’ timeline of events, according to a written statement from his closed-door interview, seems to depart from Taylor’s -- saying he notified Taylor of the call shortly after it happened.

Holmes, who is the political counsel at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, told congressional investigators that he was at a restaurant in Kiev on July 26 when Sondland spoke to Trump over the phone—just one day after Trump’s now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he asked for investigations into the Bidens and 2016 election meddling.

Holmes testified that Trump was speaking so loudly that Sondland had to hold the phone away from his ear, which allowed others to hear. Holmes said that Sondland told Trump that Zelensky “loves your ass,” to which Trump replied: “So he’s gonna do the investigation?”

“He’s gonna do it,” Sondland replied.

Holmes testified that after the call, Sondland said Trump did not “give a sh-- about Ukraine” and only cared about “big stuff” like the “Biden investigation.”

Holmes testified that he brought the contents of the call to Taylor’s attention when he returned to the embassy following a vacation that ended Aug. 6.

“After returning to the embassy, I told Ambassador Taylor about the July 26 call,” Holmes said. “I also repeatedly referred to the call and conversation with Ambassador Sondland in meetings and conversations where the issue of the president’s interest in Ukraine was potentially relevant.”

Holmes added, however, that amid the more recent media coverage surrounding the impeachment inquiry, he “made the observation to Ambassador Taylor that the incident I had witnessed has acquired greater significance, which is what he reported in his testimony earlier this week.”

Holmes seemed to indicate that he was merely reminding Taylor of the July 26 phone call, but in his testimony last week, Taylor seemed to indicate that he was only just hearing about the call.

Taylor, in the dramatic moment during last week’s hearing, claimed that “last Friday” a staff member “told him of events that occurred on July 26.”

TAYLOR CLAIMS STAFFER OVERHEARD TRUMP ASKING ABOUT 'INVESTIGATIONS'

“At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information,” Taylor testified. “I am including it here for completeness.”

The Trump campaign flagged the apparent conflict over the weekend, saying: “Both of these testimonies cannot be true.”

“The testimonies contradict one another regarding when Holmes told Taylor about the call he claims to have overheard,” the Trump campaign said in a statement. “If Holmes immediately told numerous people at the embassy about the phone call, and 'repeatedly referred' to it 'in meetings and conversations,' why did Taylor never hear about it from Holmes or someone else? Why wouldn't it have appeared in Taylor's supposedly meticulous notes?”

Holmes was back on Capitol Hill Monday, possibly to review his testimony.

While the reason for the timing discrepancy is not clear, it is not in question that Trump was seeking investigations.

The transcript of his July 25 phone call, released by the White House, showed that he was, indeed, asking Zelensky to open the investigations. The anecdote about the phone call Holmes purportedly overheard would only underscore that the president was continuing to follow up on those investigations after his call with Zelensky.

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Kiev. That call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement. Trump denies that.

Adam Schiff’s, D-Calif., impeachment carnival is entering a new week of mirth with a gaggle of hearsay witnesses offering endless speculation and opinion about an imaginary “quid pro quo” of non-corruption.",2019-11-19,Fox News,Gregg Jarrett: Trump may hope Schiff's impeachment carnival never stops,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gregg-jarrett-trump-schiff-impeachment-carnival,"Rep. Adam Schiff’s, D-Calif., impeachment carnival enters a new week with a gaggle of hearsay witnesses offering endless speculation and opinion about an imaginary “quid pro quo” of non-corruption corruption.

Like the title of Herman Wouk’s 1965 comedic farce, “Don’t Stop the Carnival,” President Trump may hope that the impeachment idiocy continues in perpetuity. Or at least until we are well into the presidential election season next year. It will all but guarantee his continued residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Schiff, who serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and Grand Poobah of the impeachment circus, is strikingly reminiscent of Wouk’s fictional main character, Norman Paperman. His hapless antics are the stuff of slapstick and buffoonery. If it can go wrong, it will. No one seems to take poor Norman seriously. Except Norman.

BRADLEY BLAKEMAN: DEMS' IMPEACHMENT OPTION — THIS IS THEIR ONLY EXIT STRATEGY

And so it is with Schiff. He is obsessed, strident, self-righteous, and so blindingly dissolute that he cannot seem to recognize the slow-motion collapse of his dream to remove Trump from office. If Americans are paying attention to his hearings, it is for the same reason we tend to watch video of buildings imploding. Or train wrecks. There is something inexplicably compelling about disasters in the making.

There is exactly zero chance that the president will be evicted by the Senate from the Oval Office. Yet, there is near certainty that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her carnival barker, Schiff, will marshal together their partisan forces to impeach Trump. After all, impeachment was preconceived and preordained the moment Trump was elected. All that was required was some pretext. Any excuse, however spurious, would do.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

For the longest time, Democrats and the complicit Trump-hating media were convinced that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would deliver them from their imagined evil. They waited eagerly for 22 months, all the while convicting the president in the court of public opinion with phony accusations and unverified stories on an almost daily basis.

Never mind that there was never any credible evidence of a criminal “collusion” conspiracy hatched by Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the bowels of the Kremlin. The Russia “witch hunt” persisted untethered to reality until the very moment Mueller’s report confirmed that it was all a hoax. Democrats and the media were apoplectic with grief and disbelief. They still are.

Since then, the seek-and-destroy Trump cabal has worked sedulously to invent some other ruse or artifice to rid themselves of their political nemesis. The Ukraine “witch hunt” is the inevitable sequel, only twice as preposterous. The allegedly incriminating evidence is no evidence at all.

The Diplomatic Coffee Klatch

Last week, the chattering class of diplomats took center stage in the carnival. Like a vacuous “coffee klatch” at Starbuck’s, they dispensed all manner of rumor and innuendo based on triple and quadruple hearsay – a guy told a guy who confided in me that the original guy “presumed” there was a ""quid pro quo."" That was Wednesday.

By Friday, the mind-numbing absurdity evolved into even more rank speculation as another diplomat, who admitted that she had no first-hand knowledge of the central issue, told her “boo-hoo” story of being fired as ambassador to Ukraine. If she had a serious complaint, she should have taken it to human resources, not a congressional impeachment inquisition. She readily confessed she knew nothing about bribery or “any criminal activity.”

Ranking Republican Devin Nunes, R-Calif., stated the obvious when he observed, “I’m not exactly sure what the ambassador is doing here today.” Good point.

It turns out that Marie Yovanovitch was sent back to Washington a full two months before Trump’s telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the supposed “quid pro quo.” But that did not stop legal counsel for the Democrats from superimposing on the giant video screen the transcript of the call and asking Yovanovitch to offer her interpretation of its contents and what the president intended.

Yovanovitch is typical of the self-important people who inhabit our nation’s foreign service. For example, she testified, “The U.S. relationship with Ukraine is the single most important relationship.”

Seriously? These diplomats have convinced themselves that the universe revolves around them. They delude themselves into believing that they are the ones who dictate foreign policy, not the president.

If Trump dares to do something they don’t like, they seek to undermine him. They are the malignant force that inhabits our government.

This week there are eight more purported “witnesses” who will be riding the Schiff carnival carousel. They, too, will be spinning opinion and conjecture built on multiple hearsay. As witnesses, they are largely superfluous.

The Trump-Zelensky conversation needs no interpretation. With a transcript available for all to read, it speaks for itself. Nowhere is there a demand, threat, condition, or pressure of a “quid pro quo” linking U.S. military aid to an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. This was corroborated by statements issued from Zelensky.

One diplomat, Bill Taylor, did manage to offer something relevant and material when he told the committee that he had three meetings with the Ukrainian president following the phone call and the subject of a “quid pro quo” never came up. This constitutes strong evidence that it never existed to begin with.

Trump’s Tease

Last week, Pelosi challenged Trump to testify at the carnival. Perhaps she thought it might make for a good sound bite.

On Monday, Trump tweeted a reply to “Nervous Nancy” that he might take her up on the offer to testify “about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt.”

The media kicked into immediate overdrive and commenced salivating over the prospect. They fell for the trap. Or joke.

Trump has no intention of lending dignity to an undignified process. He was merely teasing or tweaking Pelosi, as he is wont to do.

But you can probably expect another tweet to follow in which the president will offer to testify if Schiff transforms his inquisition into a forum that respects both fundamental fairness and due process by allowing Republicans to call their own witnesses and permit full cross-examination of Democrat witnesses without being gaveled down.

Trump knows such an offer will be rejected promptly by Schiff. It would ruin the carnival. Republicans would call the faux “whistleblower” to testify, as well as Schiff himself. Their suspected “collusion” in composing the whistleblower complaint (which doesn’t actually qualify as a legitimate complaint under the law) might well implicate Schiff as the driving force who engineered the whole Ukraine hoax as a pretext to impeach Trump. The chairman would never risk being exposed with the truth.

You see, Schiff is a desperate man. It is a measure of his desperation that he read to Yovanovitch a tweet by Trump publicly criticizing her and then all but asked her if she felt intimidated. The answer was predictable.

Schiff then implied the tweet might be grounds for an article of impeachment for “witness intimidation.” Forget the fact that Schiff created the whole incident by informing the witness of the tweet, it still does not meet the “witness intimidation” requirements of a physical threat to a witness, bribing a witness, or coercing a witness to lie. But neither facts nor the law has ever prevented Schiff from inventing a good story.

As Brad Blakeman observed in a recent Fox News Opinion column, “Democrats are already looking for a way out of the impeachment” charade. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, D-N.Y., one of only two Democrats to vote against the current inquiry, lamented that “It is supposed to be bipartisan … it is supposed to be fair.” He and other members of his party know that Schiff’s machinations have demeaned the process.

However, it may be too late to reverse course and pump the breaks on the impeachment merry-go-round. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has told reporters that the Senate will never convict Trump on such flimsy non-evidence, but that a full-blown trial seems inexorable if the House votes to impeach.

Americans have a keen sense of fairness. Increasingly, they are coming to realize that Schiff’s clown show is the antithesis of an unbiased, equitable, and impartial proceeding. The longer it endures the more likely Democrats will suffer a severe political backlash that will, in the end, benefit the incumbent president.

For this reason, Trump may hope that the carnival never stops.

On the roster: What would Buttigieg’s path look like? - As impeachment grinds on, voters dig in - Congress kicks can on spending until Dec. 20 - Audible: Audible, indeed - Three wise guys wanted for questioning



WHAT WOULD BUTTIGIEG’S PATH LOOK LIKE?

FiveThirtyEight: “[If Pete Buttigieg] winds up pulling disproportionately from [Elizabeth Warren], it could make for a more complicated race. A world where Buttigieg wins both Iowa and New Hampshire is one where Warren will have finished second (or worse) in two early states that, on paper, look tailor-made for her. The underwhelming performances could drain her support among two key elements of her base — wonky-but-not-ideological college-educated whites, who could switch to Buttigieg, and devoted progressives, who could switch to [Bernie Sanders]. In fact, the Selzer poll already showed signs that Iowa liberals were leaving Warren for Sanders; if that happens nationwide, the Democratic primary could exit Super Tuesday as a three-way race between [Joe Biden] as the candidate of nonwhite voters, Buttigieg as the candidate of party elites and Sanders as the candidate of the left.”



Dems turn to big donors to blunt Trump’s early cash advantage - WaPo: “Democratic groups financed by wealthy donors have ratcheted up their spending in recent weeks as party operatives have become concerned that President Trump is gaining an insurmountable lead in the money race. By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.”



New debate threshold squeezes also-rans - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates. To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or Washington, D.C. … The new thresholds will put pressure on Democratic candidates outside a top five – Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris – who have routinely polled above 4 percent in approved surveys so far.”



Dems try to manipulate moderators - NBC News: “The Democratic National Committee and the news organization Politico are locked in an argument over the ideological credentials of a proposed moderator for next month's Democratic debate… Politico and PBS are scheduled to co-host the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. At the behest of its publisher, Robert Allbritton, Politico is pushing for Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine… The top PBS journalists under consideration are Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor and Amna Nawaz. Politico’s decision to push for Alberta has rankled officials at the DNC… The reason: Alberta previously wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine, and has spent the bulk of his recent career chronicling the Republican Party. Democratic Party officials say such a journalist is ill-suited to co-moderate a debate meant to better inform Democratic voters about their potential nominees.”



Sanders hits 4 million donations mark - Fox News: “…[When] it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. ‘Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. ‘This is what momentum looks like.’”



Columbia, S.C. mayor backs Bloomberg - AP: “Before he’s officially a presidential candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is picking up a key endorsement in South Carolina. Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he’s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. ‘He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,’ Benjamin said in an interview. ‘I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.’ First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina’s highest-profile black politicians and was among the candidates to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016.”



Dems pleased with field, still open to changing horses - NPR: “On the 2020 presidential contest, 69% of Democrats say they're happy with the field. Less than a quarter say they're not. Three-quarters of Democrats also say they still haven't made up their minds on who to vote for, down only 7 points since July, the last time the question was asked in the survey. The survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most ‘enthusiastic’ to vote for that person. Being a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters. But there were big differences by party. Democrats would be most ‘enthusiastic’ about voting for a woman, someone who is gay or lesbian, or someone under 40. The top three qualities for Republicans, on the other hand: a business executive, a white man or a woman.”



THE RULEBOOK: HOUSE PARTY

“The number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated. Scarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be rendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 55



TIME OUT: SEVEN SCORE AND 16 YEARS AGO

On this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what is probably the finest piece of American political oratory. Speaking for less than three minutes on a sunny fall afternoon in southern Pennsylvania, Lincoln set out the duty of every generation of Americans: “To preserve and prefect the promise of our founding. Those buried at Gettysburg had died in service of that aim. Will we honor their sacrifice by living for it? “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

AS IMPEACHMENT GRINDS ON, VOTERS DIG IN

NPR: “The country is witnessing one of only a handful of times in its history that Congress has gone through with public hearings on whether to impeach a president. And yet, the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Half of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry — about the same as the poll found last month. Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But 65% of Americans say they can't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment. And 30% say yes, it's possible. … ‘We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive,’ Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said of the impeachment inquiry. ‘What we're seeing is people just locking in.’”



Army colonel testifies about Trump demand - Fox News: “One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans. Vindman acknowledged speaking with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official… Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ‘demand’ and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it ‘would be interpreted as a partisan play.’ He also emphasized that he reported his concerns ‘out of a sense of duty.’ Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been ‘excluded’ from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position.”



Impeachment scrambles Senate strategies - Politico: “The Senate is increasingly likely to hold Trump’s trial in January, according to senators and aides, a reflection of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s uncertain timeline in the House and the dismal prospects for finishing an impeachment trial in December. And pushing the trial into 2020 will bring uncertain fallout for both parties, heightening the intrigue of what will already be historic proceedings on the second floor of the Capitol. … Meanwhile, Republican senators will be in the opening of their own primary season for their reelection campaigns, in which special attention will be placed on their fealty to Trump and any whiff of independence during the trial. … Much is uncertain and out of the Senate’s direct control. No one drew up an impeachment inquiry with plans for a Senate trial in January 2020, and there’s no blueprint from past trials to draw from considering none happened in the heat of a campaign.”



CONGRESS KICKS CAN ON SPENDING UNTIL DEC. 20

Politico: “House and Senate leaders secured a deal on Monday afternoon that would extend government funding for four more weeks and sidestep a debilitating government-wide shutdown. The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature. The current stopgap expires Thursday night. The bill would fund a 3.1 percent military pay raise, it would provide extra cash to help the Commerce Department gear up for the 2020 census and it would allow state highway programs to avoid a $7.6 billion cut this summer. It also includes a number of health extenders and renews three expiring surveillance provisions through March. House Democrats, however, did not secure funding for historically black colleges and universities, an item among their requested policy riders.”



Pelosi hopes Trumka can calm freshmen’s jitters - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies are working to ease long-simmering anxiety among battleground freshmen, which has intensified amid fears that impeachment could creep into 2020 and make many of them one-term members. Pelosi will bring in AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday to speak with freshman Democrats, many of whom have been privately demanding quicker action on President Donald Trump’s trade deal, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting. The private huddle with the labor leader — at a make-or-break moment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — is an attempt to calm concerns of swing-district Democrats who fear their agenda isn’t breaking through with the public and are increasingly frustrated by policy stalemates in Washington.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Your snippet from The Atlantic article on The Crown concerning the Queen’s clothing refers to its being, along with her gender, ‘intrinsic to the way she governs.’ No British monarch has governed in well over a hundred years. As the series demonstrates in occasionally painful detail, there are two parts of the British constitution — the efficient and the dignified, represented respectively by the government and the monarch. The monarch functions primarily as the Head of State, a ceremonial position representing the nation’s stability, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, subject to the whims of the democratic electorate. In the U.S. both functions are performed by the President, while in parliamentary democracies like India, Austria, Germany, and Israel the President is the ceremonial Head of State.” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: First, Mr. Foys, let’s be clear that this is all Brianna’s fault… I kid, I kid! First, you are quite right about the distribution of duties in a constitutional monarchy. But second, I think we might be a little forgiving when it comes to the political word choices of fashion writers. I’m sure I’d make a terrible hash of clothing terminology if I was delving into the subject to make a political point. I’m more than happy to give the piece’s author, Sophie Gilbert, plenty of leeway in her genuinely interesting, thoughtful piece.]

THREE WISE GUYS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

KWCH/AP: “Goddard [Kan.] police say the owners of a camel, cow and donkey found wandering the streets of the Wichita suburb have been located. They say the animals, which looked reminiscent of a ‘nativity scene getaway,’ as some called it, belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. A neighborhood in Goddard had three unusual visitors strolling through its streets on Sunday afternoon. … ‘Well we were just coming back from picking up a friend and came into the trailer park and the first thing we see is hey there's a cow, wait a minute, that’s a donkey, and that’s a camel and we had all three,’ said Trudy Wilcox. It was quite the sight, a cow, a donkey, and a camel walking through the neighborhood. … With Christmas lights already up on some homes, the three friends brought even more holiday spirit to the neighborhood.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“What does a party do when it runs out of ideas? It can only hope that the other guy has even fewer ideas.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Nov. 2, 1990.

The president added, “Wow, she’s CRAZY!”

This morning, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who really ought to know better, picked up on Trump’s line, publishing a similarly misguided missive: “Speaker of the U.S. House of [sic] says its ‘dangerous’ to ‘let the election decide’ if [the president] should remain in office. Translation? ‘We can’t trust backwards, uneducated, everyday people to decide the Presidency, this must be decided by the enlightened people in Washington D.C.’”

Since this is apparently poised to be the Republican Party’s new toy, it’s worth pausing to shine a light on reality. Yesterday afternoon, around 2 p.m. (ET), Speaker Pelosi sent a letter to House members on the congressional impeachment inquiry. It read in part:

“The facts are uncontested: that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit, at the expense of our national security interests. “The weak response to these hearings has been, ‘Let the election decide.’ That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.”

Even those with modest reading-comprehension skills can see Pelosi did not write what Trump and Rubio claimed.

On the contrary, the Speaker raised an important point that Trump, Rubio, and other Republicans have struggled to address.

As we discussed last week, a variety of prominent GOP voices – former Ambassador Nikki Haley, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), et al. – have made the case that lawmakers should skip impeachment proceedings and simply allow the 2020 election to decide Trump’s fate. If the American electorate has a problem with Trump’s abuses, they can choose someone new. If voters are unmoved by the president’s corruption, they make that clear, too.

The trouble, of course, is the nature of the scandal itself. One of the key pillars of the whole controversy has been a simple fact: Trump intended to cheat in the election by way of an extortion scheme. The president, rightly or wrongly, saw Joe Biden as a credible electoral threat, which led him to push a vulnerable foreign ally to cook up some dirt Republicans could use before Election Day.

To let this go unpunished is to effectively encourage the president who knows no limits, and believes there can be no checks on his misconduct, to keep exploring other cheating options.

The broader national goal should be to ensure that the United States has a free and fair election next year. Trump has already taken steps that are fundamentally at odds with that goal.

It’s not as if the president has rolled out some kind of “mea culpa” defense, acknowledging poor judgment, and assuring the public that he intends to stop trying to screw around with the 2020 cycle. On the contrary, Trump has done largely the opposite, insisting his actions were “perfect,” permissible, and literally unimpeachable.

To ask “the American people” to decide the proper resolution is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months. Trump has already made it painfully obvious that he has a very different plan in mind. As former Solicitor General Neal Katyal recently put it, “Asking us to wait until the election to remove him from office is like asking to resolve a dispute based on who wins a game of Monopoly – when the very crime you’ve been accused of is cheating on Monopoly.”

This is the point Pelosi made in writing yesterday. It’s also the point Republicans like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio seem eager to avoid."

The president, without missing a beat, lied. “I didn’t delay anything,” Trump said at the time.

The next day, the Republican’s story changed and he tried to explain why his administration delayed the aid he’d just denied delaying. “We want to make sure that country is honest,” Trump told reporters. “It’s very important to talk about corruption. If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

From time to time, the White House and its allies will still pretend to take this line seriously, as if Trump, despite allegations of widespread corruption surrounding him and his team, has a deep and abiding concern related to possible Ukrainian malfeasance.

As the scandal has unfolded, the idea that the American president is sincere about this has always been laughable, and in recent days, the point has become even more absurd. Privately, administration officials keep making clear that Trump couldn’t have cared less about corruption in Ukraine, a point that’s been bolstered publicly during congressional impeachment proceedings. (When the National Security Council recommended that Trump bring up the issue during a phone meeting with Zelensky in April, and included specific talking points in briefing materials to emphasize the importance of the topic, Trump ignored the NSC, making his apparent indifference clear.)

This morning, however, these concerns came into sharper focus. Consider this exchange between House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as part of a clarification regarding the White House’s quid-pro-quo scheme.

SCHIFF: He had to get those two investigations if that official act was going to take place, correct? SONDLAND: [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky] had to announce the investigations. He didn’t actually have to do them, as I understood it.

A great many revelations have come to the fore today, many of which reinforce some of the worst fears surrounding Trump and his extortion scheme. This point about simply “announcing” investigations, without regard for follow through, is among the most striking.

In fact, there was a related exchange later on during the proceedings.

Later, Daniel Goldman, counsel for the House Democrats, pressed Sondland on the point. “You understood that in order to get that White House meeting that you wanted President Zelensky to have and that President Zelensky desperately wanted to have,” Goldman said, “that Ukraine would have to initiate these two investigations. Is that right?” “Well, they would have to announce that they were going to do it,” Sondland replied. “Right, because they – because Giuliani and President Trump didn’t actually care if they did them, right?” Goldman asked. “I never heard, Mr. Goldman, anyone say that the investigations had to start or had to be completed,” Sondland said. “The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani or otherwise was that they had to be announced in some form. And that form kept changing.” “Announced publicly?” Goldman asked. “Announced publicly,” Sondland replied.

In fairness, the way the ambassador characterized this wasn’t quite categorical. But if it’s true that Ukraine was asked to announce an investigation, without regard for actually conducting an investigation, it’s a significant revelation with broad implications.

If accurate, it means Trump and his team were solely concerned with public relations, not corruption. They wanted something that would serve a domestic political purpose in the form for a cudgel that could be used against a Democratic rival. (Some part of them may have even realized that if Ukraine bothered to do an investigation, it wouldn’t have turned up anything useful or interesting.)

In other words, what Sondland described was a scenario in which Team Trump cared about acquiring a talking point that could be used to embarrass Joe Biden – and nothing else."
219,Steve Benen,"About a year ago, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke at an event in Houston and shared some uncomplimentary thoughts about Donald Trump.

According to the nation’s former chief diplomat, the president is “pretty undisciplined,” “doesn’t like to read,” and “often” urged Tillerson to pursue policies that were inconsistent with American laws.

Trump wasn’t pleased, responding on Twitter that Tillerson was “dumb as a rock,” “lazy as hell,” and lacking in “mental capacity.”

Several months later, Tillerson testified on Capitol Hill about U.S. foreign policy and the degree to which Trump was at a disadvantage when he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Germany in 2017 – because Putin was prepared, and Trump was not. The American president again turned to Twitter to lash out, again describing Tillerson as “dumb as a rock.”

If the recent pattern holds, we should expect another angry tweet from Trump any minute now.

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday told the PBS NewsHour that asking for personal favors and using United States assets as collateral is “wrong.” Tillerson spoke with NewsHour anchor and managing editor Judy Woodruff at a luncheon hosted by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in San Antonio. Tillerson discussed reports that President Donald Trump pushed to withhold from Ukraine nearly $400 million in military aid until the country’s president agreed to open investigations into political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden.

Tillerson specifically told PBS, “If you’re seeking some kind of personal gain and you’re using – whether it’s American foreign aid or American weapons or American influence – that’s wrong.”

Obviously, this in no way resembles the official White House line on Trump’s Ukraine scandal.

What the president has never understood about his antagonistic relationship with Tillerson is that the former secretary of State can cause Trump more harm than Trump can cause Tillerson. No matter what insulting remarks the president makes about the former secretary of State, Tillerson remains wholly unaffected.

But when a former top member of the president’s cabinet takes rhetorical shots in Trump’s direction, it has more of an impact.

What’s more, Tillerson may yet do even more damage, given his knowledge about Trump’s dubious intervention in support of one of Rudy Giuliani’s more controversial clients.

As for the former cabinet secretary’s comments to PBS yesterday, Tillerson added, “I don’t worry about the future. I believe the American people are smart. I believe the American people ultimately, if they see something that they don’t feel is serving the American people or serving our national security,” they will make a change.

Part of me wonders whether the Democratic presidential nominee next year might reach out to Tillerson for an endorsement."

Democrats have argued that the White House improperly pressured Ukraine to look into the Bidens and Burisma Holdings, the natural gas company where Hunter Biden held a lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president. George Kent, a State Department official who has also testified in the impeachment investigation, said he flagged Hunter Biden's apparent conflict of interest to the Obama administration at the time.

However, Hale said, he saw the Bidens referenced only in media reports -- as well as in a ""speculative"" email from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who testified last week. Hale is scheduled to testify publicly Wednesday.

Yovanovitch ""mentioned that Mayor [Rudy] Giuliani might have been motivated to sully Vice President Biden's reputation by reminding the world of the issue regarding his son's activities in Ukraine,"" Hale testified, referring to President Trump's personal attorney.

KEY WITNESS APPEARS TO DIRECTLY CONTRADICT DIPLOMAT IN DEMS' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

""When the whistleblower reports and all that came out of that, that's when I first saw this,"" Hale, the under secretary of state for political affairs, testified.

Separately, Hale recalled that representatives from key executive departments -- including the Treasury Department, Office of Management and Budget, Department of Homeland Security and State Department -- ""endorsed the resumption of military aid"" to Ukraine.

Under questioning from Democrats, Hale acknowledged he was ""out of the loop"" on a variety of matters, and that Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland didn't brief him about ""discussions he was having with his Ukraine counterparts to either condition the White House meeting or the aid on these investigations."" Additionally, Hale noted that he was similarly ""out of the loop"" on acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's discussions with the president concerning Ukraine aid.

TOP GOP REP DEMANDS POSTPONEMENT, CITING NEW 'DEVELOPMENT' IN IMPEACHMENT PROBE

Mulvaney has acknowledged that White House assistance to Ukraine was tied to the country's broader anti-corruption efforts, although he did not state that the aid was linked to a probe of the Bidens in particular.

""This is a corrupt place. Everyone knows this is a corrupt place ... Plus, I'm not sure that the other European countries are helping them out either,"" Mulvaney said last month. He added: ""Did [Trump] also mention to me, in the past, the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that, but that's it, and that's why we held up the money ... The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation, and that is absolutely appropriate.""

Also late Monday, Democrats released testimony from State Department official David Holmes, who said in his Nov. 15 deposition that the conversation he overheard between Trump and Sondland during a lunch in Ukraine was so distinctive — even extraordinary — that nobody needed to refresh his memory.

Holmes testified that he told ""a number of friends of mine"" about the call because it was ""like, a really extraordinary thing"" to be ""part of"" a lunch in which ""someone called the president."" He insisted he didn't go into detail about the call while he boasted about it, but estimated that he may have told as many as six friends.

""I've never seen anything like this,"" Holmes told House investigators, ""someone calling the president from a mobile phone at a restaurant, and then having a conversation of this level of candor, colorful language. There's just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly.""

Holmes testified that after a bottle of wine, Sondland ""said that he was going to call President Trump to give him an update. Ambassador Sondland placed a call on his mobile phone, and I heard him announce himself several times, along the lines of: 'Gordon Sondland holding for the president.' It appeared that he was being transferred through several layers of switchboards and assistances. I then noticed Ambassador Sondland’s demeanor change, and understood that he had been connected to President Trump.""

TRUMP 'STRONGLY' CONSIDERING PELOSI INVITE TO TESTIFY IN IMPEACHMENT PROBE

The conversation between the president and the ambassador July 26 came one day after the call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to the impeachment inquiry.

Holmes' account of the conversation in Kiev was the first to include Trump personally calling about the investigations into Democrats and Joe Biden.

Holmes, who joined Sondland and others during the lunch meeting, told investigators Trump was talking so loudly he could hear the president clearly on the ambassador's phone.

""I then heard President Trump ask, quote, 'So he's going to do the investigation?'"" Holmes testified. ""Ambassador Sondland replied that 'He's going to do it,' adding that President Zelensky will, quote, 'do anything you ask him to.'""

Holmes said he didn't take notes of the conversation he overheard between Trump and Sondland but remembered it ""vividly.""

Pressed during the interview if anyone helped him recall the details, Holmes said, ""that wouldn’t have been needed, sir, because, as I said, the event itself was so distinctive that I remember it very clearly.""

Holmes said Sondland announced that the president was ""in a bad mood."" And, Holmes said he ""asked Ambassador Sondland if it was true that the president did not give a sh-- about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland agreed that the president did not give a sh-- about Ukraine..nope, not at all, doesn’t give a sh-- about Ukraine.""

Holmes said the president ""only cares about 'big stuff.'"" Holmes testified that Sondland said that didn't mean war with Russia, but ""this Biden investigation that Giuliani is pushing.""

During a meeting between then-National Security Advisor John Bolton and Zelensky’s top aide Andriy Bogdan in Kiev, Holmes served as note-taker. Holmes indicated Bolton was frustrated ""about Giuliani's influence with the president, making clear that there was nothing he could do about it.""

""I came to believe it was the president's political agenda"" that Guiliani was pursuing in Ukraine, Holmes went on, ""because Mr. Giuliani was promoting that investigations issue, which later I came to understand, including through these various interactions, that was -- that the president cared about.""

Holmes, a political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, is scheduled to testify publicly Thursday.

Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Kiev, is the second witness to revise his testimony, after Gordon Sondland, in what appeared to be a gift to the Democrats.

He dropped his previous insistence that there was no talk of investigations at a crucial July 10 White House meeting that was cut short by John Bolton. Volker told the House hearing that Sondland made a “generic comment” about investigations and “all of us thought it was inappropriate.” This put him on the side of several other witnesses who expressed concern about President Trump freezing military aid to Ukraine.

TRUMP TEASES IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY AMID SCANDAL FATIGUE

However, Volker said he must have left or been involved in a side conversation because he didn’t hear Bolton express his strong objections to what had just happened. And although he was a point of contact for Rudy Giuliani, he claimed to be “out of the loop” on the linkage between the aid and Ukraine promising to investigate the Bidens or its role in the 2016 election—a linkage he now calls “unacceptable.”

What’s more, Volker said he has known Biden for many years, that he deems the former VP an “honorable man,” and that allegations that he acted improperly with Ukraine “are just not credible to me.”

Volker remained doggedly low key, obviously trying to thread the needle between openly breaking with Trump and distancing himself from the withholding of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. He said he should have realized that the push for Ukrainian investigations was actually specifically aimed at probing the gas giant Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden.

But he opened himself up to charges of inconsistency, especially since he just happened to recall the mention of Ukrainian investigations after other witnesses recounted that—in more detail—at the meeting attended by Volker.

For the Democrats, the late afternoon admissions salvaged what had been a sleepy third day of hearings.

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, sitting ramrod straight with a chest full of medals, said flatly that “it was improper for the president to demand an investigation of a political opponent,” especially from a foreign power.

And yet his testimony was oddly anti-climactic.

True to his military bearing, Vindman was stiff, hesitant and by the book, answering questions at the House impeachment hearing in an unwavering monotone.

He says he conveyed concern about President Trump’s call with Volodomyr Zelensky “through official channels,” through the “chain of command,” acting only “to carry out my duty.” He bristled when ranking Republican Devin Nunes called him “Mr. Vindman” and asked to be addressed by his title.

Vindman’s military service as a career officer, including a Purple Heart, after his family fled the Soviet Union was admirable. But his testimony was far less compelling than the appearances of William Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch.

More important, virtually everything that Vindman had to say had already been leaked or released. He said John Bolton had abruptly ended a July 10 meeting after Gordon Sondland spoke of Ukraine’s need to investigate the Bidens and any role in 2016 hacking. He said he told a White House lawyer that Trump raising investigations with Ukraine’s leader was “inappropriate” and “had nothing to do with national security.” These points are important, but old news.

Vindman, to his credit, was so cautious that he when he was asked why the official readout on the Trump-Zelensky call cited anti-corruption efforts when that was not mentioned, he said it was common to include such messaging.

The lieutenant colonel had two noteworthy moments. One was when he said he could not deliver such testimony in his birthplace, the old Soviet Union. The other was when he said the attacks on last week’s witnesses were “vile” and “reprehensible.”

Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Pence who listened to the July 25 call, said she found it “a domestic political matter.” But she didn’t have much behind-the-scenes information—she put it in Pence’s briefing book but doesn’t know if he read it—and no one landed a glove on her.

Williams said she was “surprised” when the president tweeted that she was a Never Trumper. She denied that, saying “I was not expecting to be called out by name.” Vindman said he is not a Never Trumper, he was a “Never Partisan.”

The Intel Committee session hit a snag when Adam Schiff accused the GOP counsel, and later Jim Jordan, of trying to out the whistle-blower by asking Vindman about his testimony that he’d told an intelligence community official about the Trump call. In the first instance, Schiff’s intervention led Vindman to decline to answer.

The president, at a Cabinet meeting, said he didn’t know who Vindman was and questioned why he testified in full-dress military attire.

Despite the unmistakably subdued tone of the morning hearing, some pundits were excited by the session.

MSNBC, which has abandoned a straight-news approach to the hearings, had its coverage anchored by host Nicolle Wallace, a former Republican who detests Trump (after Chris Matthews was the anchor on Friday). Wallace called the testimony “stunning.” Another liberal host, Ari Melber, said it was “devastating.” Former Democratic senator Claire McCaskill said part of it was “powerful.”

On CNN, whose coverage was anchored by journalists, John King said Republicans are “cherry picking” and their questioning of witnesses’ character is “a sideshow.” Jeffrey Toobin said Trump’s culpability “has been proven over and over again.”

On Fox, whose coverage was anchored by journalists, former special prosecutor Ken Starr said Vindman has “a great American story” but had acknowledged that there was nothing illegal about Trump freezing military aid to Ukraine.

Earlier, Nunes took direct aim at the media and the whistle-blower, even questioning whether the CIA officer has been in touch with journalists.

Nunes, who boasted that ""TV ratings are way down,"" repeatedly insisted that the testimony of three career diplomats last week was far less important and dramatic than portrayed in media accounts. He then pivoted to Russia, reciting headlines from that investigation that he said were false.

I’m not one who believes the hearings have to be a raucous TV show. If there is damaging new information, it doesn’t matter if it’s delivered in a reading-from-the-phone-book tone. But it was Kurt Volker, not Alexander Vindman, who made news Tuesday by changing his story."

Pence Chief of Staff Marc Short said in a statement that the purported conversation between him and Sondland “never happened.”

“The vice president never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations,” Pence said in his statement. “Ambassador Gordon Sondland was never alone with Vice President Pence on the September 1 trip to Poland. This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened.”

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS: LIVE UPDATES FROM DAY FOUR

Sondland on Wednesday morning said in his opening statement that he had spoken to Pence about the delay in military aid to Ukraine, voicing concern this was tied to investigations. Sondland said he believed the aid would not be released until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government announced an investigation concerning the Bidens.

“I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations,” Sondland said. “During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. The Vice President said he would speak to President Trump about it.”

Sondland added: “Based on my communications with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. [Andriy] Yermak [an aide to Zelensky]. In a very brief pull-aside conversation, that happened within a few seconds, I told Mr. Yermak that I believed that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.”

Sondland also made clear he never heard directly from Trump on such a quid pro quo.

The impeachment inquiry into Trump began when a whistleblower reported that the president had pushed Zelensky to launch a public investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine—specifically, why former Vice President Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings.

Hunter Biden worked for the Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev.

Sondland told the House Intelligence Committee that he never heard Trump say that military aid to Ukraine was conditioned on a public announcement by the Ukrainian president that the country was investigating Democrats, but he added that it was clear that a meeting in the White House between Trump and Zelensky was conditioned on investigations.

He also said Trump never told him a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president would not happen without a public announcement. He heard that from Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

Sondland said it was a personal guess that the military aid was being held up until an announcement, one that others eventually also made.

Mike Turner, R-Ohio, hammered America's ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, during Wednesday's testimony, seizing on Sondland's admission that he never heard the president or anyone else in the White House explicitly link Ukrainian aid with the opening of an investigation into 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., applauded his colleague on producing ""the real bombshell"" of Sondland's long-anticipated testimony and marked the moment as ""game over,"" for the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry. That inquiry is focusing on an alleged quid pro quo between President Trump and Ukraine linking military aid and White House access to Ukraine probes beneficial to Trump.

During a fiery exchange, Turner focused on the Republican Party's main defense of Trump, asking Sondland: ""Is that your testimony today, Mr. Sondland? That you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation to the aid? Because I don't think you're saying that.""

Sondland admitted that he was ""presuming"" the stalled military aid was linked to Trump allegedly asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens' financial interests in Ukraine.

SONDLAND IMPLICATES TOP OFFICIALS ON UKRAINE, BUT SAYS HE 'NEVER HEARD' QUID PRO QUO FROM TRUMP

""So no one told you,"" Turner pressed on. ""Not just the president. Giuliani didn't tell you, Mulvaney didn't tell you. Nobody. Pompeo didn't tell you. Nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct?""

The congressman cut Sondland off, restating his point: ""No one on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying this aid to the investigations, because if your answer is yes, then the chairman is wrong and the headline on CNN is wrong. No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations. Yes or no?""

""Yes,"" Sondland replied.

""So, you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations?"" Turner asked.

""Other than my own presumption,"" Sondland said.

Throughout Wednesday's testimony, Sondland insisted that although he never explicitly heard the president or anyone in the administration demand investigations in exchange for aid, he never got a clear answer on why the aid was held up. He said the absence of a clear explanation led him to believe that the aid and the investigations were being linked.

Turner dismissed Sondland's ""presumption"" as ""nothing"" and called his testimony ""made up.""

""You know what hearsay evidence is, ambassador?"" Turner said. ""Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. Do you know what made-up testimony is? Made-up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean you're just assuming all of these things and then you're giving them the evidence that they're running out and doing press conferences and CNN's headline is saying that you're saying the president of the United States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations -- and you don't know that. Correct?""

""I never said the president of the United States should be impeached,"" Sondland responded.

Still, Sondland's earlier testimony to the committee linked the potential Ukraine investigations and a White House meeting and call between Trump and Zelensky. He said Giuliani played an integral, if not unconventional, role in those arrangements -- and he said he explicitly expressed his fears about an inappropriate quid pro quo.

“I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo?"" Sondland said. ""As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.”"

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., along with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, penned a scathing letter to Schiff in which they slammed the “sham ‘impeachment inquiry’” and notified the chairman of their intent to subpoena Biden and the whistleblower. Jordan, the ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, has been appointed as a temporary member of the House Intelligence Committee.

“The American people understand how you have affirmatively prevented Republicans from examining serious issues directly relevant to the issues,” the two GOP lawmakers told Schiff in their letter. “Therefore, to provide some basic level of fairness and objectivity to your ‘impeachment inquiry,’ we intend to subpoena the anonymous whistleblower and Hunter Biden for sworn testimony in closed-door depositions.”

Nunes and Jordan added that they plan to subpoena the whistleblower’s documents and communications regarding the complaint, the records surrounding Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings and the Democratic National Committee’s communications with Ukrainian officials and records relating to Alexandra Chalupa.

A Ukrainian-American consultant for the Democratic National Committee, Chalupa allegedly had meetings with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C. to discuss incriminating information about Trump campaign officials during the 2016 presidential election.

This is the second letter that Nunes has sent to Schiff that relayed his intentions to call the whistleblower and Hunter Biden.

Earlier this month, Nunes sent a similar letter to Schiff about wanting those witnesses, but it remains unclear how many of the Republicans’ proposed witnesses will be approved by Schiff. A recently approved resolution governing the impeachment inquiry gave the approval power to the chairman and the members of the majority.

""To provide transparency to your otherwise opaque and unfair process, and after consultation with [House Oversight Committee] Ranking Member Jim Jordan and [House Foreign Affairs Committee] Ranking Member Michael McCaul, the American people deserve to hear from the following witnesses in an open setting,"" Nunes said in his earlier letter.

Perhaps the most startling news of the day was that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is continuing to block progress on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade, apparently in exchange for commitments on impeachment.

As we consider key takeaways, keep in mind that last week’s witnesses never spoke to President Trump. They also were not on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – the call that launched the baseless impeachment inquiry.

TOM DEL BECCARO: ADAM SCHIFF’S IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS MOST ONE-SIDED IN HISTORY – A POLITICAL ATTACK ON GOP

By contrast, two of the witnesses Tuesday were listening in on the call. They are National Security Council Ukraine expert Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and State Department Foreign Service Officer Jennifer Williams, who is an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence on Europe and Russia.

The other witnesses testifying Tuesday have firsthand knowledge of the evolving relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine. They are former U.S. Special Representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker and former National Security Council aide Tim Morrison.

Overall, here are the key takeaways from Tuesday’s testimony.

The day of the diplomat

The early testimony has been dominated by diplomats, along with Lt. Col. Vindman.

All of these people told us about their foreign policy views – diplomatic views the Democrats suddenly find inviolate. The Democrats do this despite the fact that they did not press President Barack Obama to give military aid to Ukraine that those same witnesses favored at the time.

Among those views, consider Vindman’s deposition testimony that he and other foreign policy experts in government have “the best, most informed judgment.” He said he was the “most knowledgeable” and said it was not appropriate for other government officials to act to “counter” the views of him and his fellow experts.

Perhaps Vindman’s feeling of self-importance can be placed in context, given that he was offered a senior position in Ukraine as defense minister, which he said he declined and never considered accepting.

Democrats have double standards

These hearings have demonstrated that our ambassadors and other U.S. government officials were involved in the internal politics of Ukraine. Indeed, when he was vice president, Joe Biden engineered the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor.

Just imagine if a Ukrainian official was able to have former Special Counsel Robert Mueller fired.

Vindman testified that he told Ukrainian officials that they should not get involved in American domestic politics. So why are Democrats suddenly OK with America intervening in Ukraine’s internal politics? Likely for the same reason they said nothing when President Obama worked to defeat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israeli elections.

Republicans put Joe Biden on trial in absentia

Before Tuesday, there had been a fairly one-sided story told about Ukraine. That story was that President Trump was wrong to seek information about the activities of Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.

Tuesday was different, however. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told a national audience tuning in on TV these important facts:

A) In September 2015 the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine asked for an investigation into the president of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company on whose board Hunter Biden served, reportedly at a salary of about $50,000 per month. Hunter Biden has no expertise on Ukraine or on the natural gas industry.

B) Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who testified last week in the impeachment hearings, characterized Hunter Biden’s position on the Burisma board while his father was vice president as a potential conflict of interest (as other witnesses have confirmed).

C) Burisma routed over $3 million to accounts tied to Hunter Biden.

D) Burisma’s American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after Joe Biden forced the firing of the Ukraine’s chief prosecutor, who was looking into Burisma.

E) Burisma’s lawyers pressured the U.S. State Department in February 2016, after a law enforcement raid on the home of Burisma’s president, and used Hunter Biden’s name as a reason to intervene.

F) Joe Biden called the president of Ukraine at least three times after the raid on the home of Burisma’s president.

Learning these facts, which are based on documents and interviews, the question is whether the American people will now see that, at the very least, the Bidens should not be above investigation – and that Joe Biden may have acted to serve the best interest of his son when demanding the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor.

Outing the whistleblower

Perhaps the tensest moments of the hearing were when Vindman refused to answer questions about who he spoke to about the Trump-Zelensky phone call.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. – who lied about his committee’s contacts with the so-called whistleblower, who kicked off the whole impeachment inquiry – stepped into that discussion to stop any possibility of outing the whistleblower.

Schiff’s motivation for doing that may well be to hide his own wrongdoing.

The Democrats’ bias against President Trump

This entire impeachment inquiry is based on the Democrats’ view that President Trump could only have acted in his own personal interest when asking about information related to the Bidens.

The Democrats refuse to acknowledge that Trump’s actions could have been prompted by a different motivation – that he was requesting information pursuant to a U.S.-Ukrainian treaty that permits heads of state to request information related to investigations – in this case, a U.S. investigation.

On the other hand, despite ample evidence that Joe Biden could have been acting in his own self-interest, the Democrats say the only possible conclusion for Biden’s motivation was innocent. The Democrats claim Bind was acting on the consensus view (which Biden helped build) that the prosecutor had to be fired because he was corrupt.

In other words, the Democrats assert President Trump can only act in his own self-interest and that Joe Biden could only be acting in our national interest.

Also, it may be that the Ukrainian prosecutor fired under pressure from Biden was corrupt. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the prosecutor’s investigation of Burisma was a corrupt act. Indeed, witnesses testifying before Schiff’s committee have made it abundantly clear that Burisma was corrupt.

Schiff is making inaccurate statements

In advance of each witness, Chairman Schiff gave what amounted to a statement summarizing the evidence as he sees it. The witnesses, however, have not testified consistent with Schiff’s summaries, as the cross-examination by the Republicans has often established.

Vindman’s speculation didn’t provide any damning facts

It was telling that at one point Vindman suggested that his opinion was “informed speculation.” In plain truth, the facts at issue remain rather few and are not as damning as Schiff and the Democrats claim.

It is true that Trump sought investigations related to the Bidens. It is true that the Ukrainians wanted military aid. However, as the policy developed, and more was learned about the new Ukrainian president, the aid was given without restriction and without a quid pro quo, according to Volker, who painted an image of a developing and complicated process.

Further, as Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, pointed out at the hearing, the two witnesses listening to the Trump-Zelensky phone call had different views on the importance of the call.

Based on all of the above, the Democrats didn’t advance the ball on the third day of the impeachment hearings. Indeed, Volker and Morrison undercut the Democrats.

On the other hand, Tuesday’s hearing harmed Joe Biden’s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination – and, given the length and lack of revealing information at the hearing, it may have caused Americans’ eyes to roll at the thought of impeachment.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking the witnesses about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: ""Mr. Morrison, you were on that call, and there was no quid pro quo, correct? No bribery? No extortion?""

""Correct,"" Morrison replied in response to each question.

""And, Ambassador Volker, I presume you got a readout of the call. ... Was there any reference to withholding aid? Any reference to bribery? Any reference to quid pro quo? Any reference to extortion?""

""No, there was not,"" Volker replied, again and again.

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats as their impeachment inquiry continued into its second week of public hearings: With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years.

Morrison, in another key moment, testified Tuesday afternoon that he understood the transcript of Trump's call with Ukraine's leader wound up on a highly secured and classified computer system due to an ""administrative error"" -- not, as Democrats have alleged, because the president wanted to hide his conversation.

And, Volker testified repeatedly that he never received any indications at all that there was an improper quid pro quo with Ukraine, in which the Trump administration allegedly sought a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid.

As the hearing concluded, President Trump tweeted, ""A great day for Republicans, a great day for our Country!""

Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan told Fox News, ""This was a very good day for Republicans, for our president.""

""Kind of hard to prove a corrupt quid pro quo theory when the key U.S. policy people, plus the Ukrainians, were never aware of such an arrangement,"" Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw added late Tuesday, noting that Ukraine's president has said he felt no pressure from Trump to open any probes. ""Can we go back to governing now, that’d be great thanks.""

Morrison and Volker's testimony was sought by the GOP, and the two undercut Democrats' poll-tested claims of White House ""bribery"" and a cover-up. But, they also raised new questions concerning the administration's use of the little-discussed codeword-level system that ordinarily held sensitive national-security information. Back in September, a senior Trump administration official acknowledged that White House lawyers directed moving the transcript of the call to the secure system, noting that several of Trump's previous phone calls with foreign leaders had leaked to the media.

Morrison previously testified behind closed doors that senior NSC lawyer John Eisenberg had relayed to him that his secretary accidentally put the transcript in the classified system. Morrison said Eisenberg wanted to ""restrict access"" to the transcript, but maintained that the secretary had apparently misinterpreted that instruction.

""It was represented to me that it was a mistake,"" Morrison testified Tuesday, saying he tried to ""pull up the package in our system"" but was prevented from doing so. When he asked why the transcript was unavailable, he testified that he was ""informed it had been moved to the higher classification system"" at Eisenberg's direction. Then, Eisenberg told Morrison that he ""gave no such direction"" and that it was an ""administrative error,"" according to Morrison.

Morrison said to the best of his knowledge, there was no ""malicious intent"" in the decision to move the transcript to the compartmentalized system, and all essential personnel retained access to the transcript even after it was moved.

Later in the day, Volker made clear he had not seen anything to support Democrats' contention that Trump improperly withheld foreign aid to Ukraine as a means of forcing an investigation into the Bidens' dealings in the country.

Instead, Volker suggested -- in a moment that the Trump campaign reposted on social media -- that Trump's general hesitation to provide foreign aid, especially to corrupt countries, was the prevailing justification for holding up aid to Ukraine temporarily.

Asked again whether he saw any evidence that Trump had committed ""bribery"" -- the term Democrats have taken to using, after focus groups indicated that it would help them sell impeachment to voters -- Volker was unequivocal that he had not. In fact, Volker said, Trump never linked any probe of Burisma or the Bidens to any military aid. Hunter Biden sat on Burisma's board while his father spearheaded Ukraine policy as vice president.

""I have only seen an allegation of bribery in the last week,"" Volker said. ""I was never involved in anything that I considered to be bribery at all, or extortion.""

In one remarkable moment, Volker contradicted a media headline; asked about a Daily Mail story claiming he had ""walked back"" his testimony and had ""now learned"" there was a link between U.S. aid and Biden probe, Volker refuted the website outright.

Volker also said he didn't initially realize the connection between a Trump-sought investigation of Burisma and the Bidens, given that Burisma was seen as a symbol of Ukraine's endemic corruption problem.

Hunter Biden was a board member of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, which had been under investigation before then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in charge. In his call with Zelensky, Trump suggested the Ukrainians look into the circumstances of the prosecutor's termination, including Joe Biden's boast that he had the prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in critical aid. ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me,"" Trump said.

In a lengthy opening statement, Volker said he didn't have any problem with pushing Ukraine to open an investigation into Burisma or corruption.

""It has long been U.S. policy under multiple administrations to urge Ukraine to investigate and fight internal corruption,"" Volker said.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent similarly testified behind closed doors last month that he had qualms about Hunter Biden's lucrative role on the board of Burisma.

However, Volker said he felt a discussion of investigations was “inappropriate” in a July meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. officials at the White House. Volker confirmed others’ testimony that Trump's European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, raised the investigations “in a generic way,"" and that then-national security adviser John Bolton immediately ended the meeting.

The meeting happened two weeks before Trump’s momentous summer phone call with Zelensky.

Volker, who resigned in September after becoming embroiled in the scandal, added that he didn't ""understand"" at the time that an investigation of Burisma ""was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden.""

""I saw them as very different – the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable,"" Volker said. ""In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.""

Volker added: “The allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and non-credible.""

Volker went on to say that during a September dinner with top Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak, he’d discouraged Ukraine from trying to prosecute the country’s previous president. Volker says he warned it would sow deep societal divisions.

Volker said Yermak quipped in response, “You mean like asking us to investigate Clinton and Biden?” Volker claimed he didn’t “quite understand” the head-turning remark and was “kind of puzzled” by it.

Both Volker and Morrison previously gave closed-door interviews to the inquiry: Volker provided investigators with a package of text messages with Sondland and William Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires for Ukraine, who said he grew alarmed at the possible linkage of the investigations to the aid.

For his part, Morrison, who served as the NSC's senior director of European and Russian affairs, told lawmakers Trump didn't want tax dollars funding Ukrainian corruption and remarked that he wasn't concerned Trump's calls with Ukraine's leader were tied to his political interests.

Morrison resigned from the NSC last month. In his testimony Tuesday, he said he left on his ""own volition"" and made the decision ""before I decided to testify.""

The testimony from Volker and Morrison followed five hours of testimony earlier in the day with the NSC's Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Vice President Pence aide Jennifer Williams, who were each critical of Trump's conversation with Zelensky.

In a particularly remarkable moment, Vindman testified that he was asked to serve as Ukraine’s defense minister three times -- but repeatedly denied the offers -- when he traveled to Kiev for the inauguration of Ukraine's president. Oleksander Danylyuk, the former Chairman of the National Security and Defence Council in Ukraine, reportedly said on Tuesday the offer was ""clearly a joke.""

Among the biggest revelations Tuesday morning came when Vindman acknowledged communications with an unnamed intelligence official -- during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans, immediately raising apparent questions over whether he could have been a source of information for the anonymous whistleblower who reported the call.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., interjected to express concern that Republicans were trying to out the whistleblower through the questioning. After consulting his attorney, Vindman said, ""Per the advice of my counsel, I've been advised not to answer the specific questions about members of the intelligence community.""

Still, Vindman told lawmakers, ""I do not know who the whistleblower is.""

That claim didn't hold water with Republicans, and prompted Donald Trump Jr. to accuse Vindman of perjury. “I’d like them to be treated like I would be if I lied to Congress,"" he told Fox News late Tuesday.

On the whole, Vindman was largely critical of Trump's call with Zelensky, describing the investigation ""demand"" as ""improper."" At one point, Vindman described his reaction to Trump’s call as one of ""shock.""

""Frankly, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing,"" he testified. ""In certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out.""

However, Vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by Republican Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Vindman testified earlier in the day that he did not discuss his concerns about Trump's July phone call with Morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable.

But, under questioning from Wenstrup, Morrison confirmed that Vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that Vindman testified Morrison was unreachable.

""Frankly, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing."" — NSC's Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, concerning Trump's July call with Ukraine's leader

Arizona GOP Rep. Paul Gosar offered a blunt assessment of Vindman's testimony, tweeting: ""I think people need a reminder: the democrats said they would impeach starting in December 2016–before @realDonaldTrump was even sworn in. This is a hearing looking for a reason. It’s corrupt and immoral. The dude in the uniform is a seditionist.""

Morrison, meanwhile, also said he had heard others express concern that Vindman was a leaker, and could not be trusted with key information. Asked about that allegation, Vindman read from a glowing performance review that described him as an exemplary officer.

The other morning witness, Williams, also expressed concern about Trump's call with Zelensky, saying, ""I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.""

Until Tuesday, none of the witnesses who have testified at the public hearings had first-hand knowledge of the president's thinking, which Republicans have used to cast doubt on Democrats' allegations, but Vindman, Williams, and Morrison all listened in on Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky.

TRUMP SLAMS PELOSI AS 'GROSSLY INCOMPETENT' FOR TRADE DEAL HANDLING, CALLS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY A 'KANGAROO COURT'

Morrison said his understanding was that Trump generally was skeptical of foreign aid, and wanted to make sure that taxpayers were ""getting their money's worth.""

""The president was concerned that the United States seemed to bear the exclusive brunt of security assistance to Ukraine,"" Morrison said. ""He wanted to see the Europeans step up and contribute more security assistance.""

The impeachment inquiry has focused on a possible link between military aid to Ukraine and investigations sought by Trump pertaining to the Bidens and Democrats. The questions arose after the July 25 phone call led to a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine into helping him.

""As we have heard from other witnesses, when Joe Biden was considering whether to enter the race for the presidency in 2020, the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, began a campaign to weaken Vice President Biden’s candidacy by pushing Ukraine to investigate him and his son,"" Schiff said in his opening statement.

Nunes opened his remarks by welcoming people to ""Act Two of today's circus,"" dismissing the inquiry as a partisan exercise.

WATCH: VINDMAN CORRECTS CONGRESSMAN WHO DIDN'T USE HIS FORMAL MILITARY TITLE

""It's an ambitious attack to deprive the American people of their right to elect a president that the Democrats don’t like,"" Nunes said. ""The chairman of this committee claims that democracy is under threat. If that's true, it's not the president who poses the danger.""

Morrison, though, suggested the impeachment brouhaha was predictable partisan politics as usual.

""I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate,"" Morrison said in his opening statement. ""My fears have been realized.""

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), still the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, continues to approach Donald Trump’s impeachment inquiry in deeply strange ways. In fact, what’s become clear over the last week or so is that the Republican congressman’s efforts to defend the president fall into three categories.

The first is to play an awkward projection, rubber-glue game. Aware that the White House’s critics see Trump as peddling outlandish conspiracy theories to cult-like followers, Nunes accused Democrats of peddling outlandish conspiracy theories to cult-like followers. Aware of John Bolton’s description of the president’s Ukraine scheme as a “drug deal,” Nunes yesterday described the impeachment inquiry as a “drug deal.”

The second part of the strategy is to use the proceedings to advance discredited partisan arguments. Yesterday, for example, Nunes accused Joe Biden of “threatening to withhold U.S. loan guarantees unless the Ukrainians fired a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.” We already know that’s not even close to what actually happened.

But the third prong of Nunes’ defense is pretending Trump didn’t do things we already know he did. The Republican congressman made this pitch this morning as the impeachment proceedings got underway on Capitol Hill:

“In their mania to attack the president, no conspiracy theory is too outlandish for the Democrats. “Time and again, they floated the possibility of some far-fetched malfeasance by Trump, declared the dire need to investigate it, and then suddenly dropped the issue and moved on to their next asinine theory.”

Nunes proceeded to list a series of “accusations and insinuations,” which included Democrats alleging that Trump “received nefarious materials from the Russians through a Trump campaign aide”; Trump had “a diabolical plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow”; and Trump “changed the Republican National Committee platform to hurt Ukraine and benefit Russia.”

The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee described each of these as “false charges” and “ludicrous accusations,” which would be more compelling if they were, in fact, false and ludicrous.

We know, for example, that Roger Stone, a former Trump campaign aide, was convicted of multiple felonies – just four days ago – and as part of the trial, other former Trump campaign aides said Stone was seen as the point person on learning about materials stolen by Russia.

We also know that Trump really did have a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, which was an endeavor Trump pursued during his presidential campaign, and which was something the president lied about.

We also know that the Trump campaign really did change the RNC platform to hurt Ukraine and benefit Russia.

I suppose the follow-up question for Devin Nunes is simple: how does he not know that the “false charges” he listed this morning aren’t, in reality, false?"

Col. Alexander Vindman testified in Tuesday's impeachment hearing that the omission of the word “Burisma” -- the Ukrainian natural gas firm that hired Hunter Biden to serve in a lucrative role on the board -- in the transcript of President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not “significant,” despite some prior controversy over the missing references.

Vindman, a director at the National Security Council, testified alongside Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Pence, as part of the House’s public phase of impeachment hearings. Both officials listened to Trump and Zelensky’s now-infamous phone call over the summer.

WHAT IS BURISMA HOLDINGS? THE STORY BEHIND THE SCANDAL-TIED UKRAINE FIRM THAT HIRED HUNTER BIDEN

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., asked both officials whether the name of the Ukrainian natural gas firm—Burisma Holdings—was mentioned on the call when Trump pressed Zelensky for an investigation into the Bidens and 2016 election meddling. Both confirmed that they heard the name Burisma on the call, but that it was missing from the transcript of the conversation that the White House released to the public in September.

Williams said she was “not involved in the production of the transcript,” so was unaware why the word Burisma was not included.

But Vindman attributed the omission, simply, “to the fact that this transcript being produced may have not caught the word Burisma.”

“It was in the transcript that was released as ‘the company,’ which is accurate,” Vindman said. “It’s not a significant omission.”

Vindman added that it was “informed speculation that the folks that produce these transcripts do the best they can, and they just didn’t catch the word.

“It was my responsibility to, then, make sure the transcript was as accurate as possible, and that’s what I attempted to do, by putting the word back in because it was in my notes,” he explained.

The testimony comes after his prior closed-door comments on the same issue made headlines weeks ago, with multiple articles flagging the omission of ""Burisma"" -- seemingly stirring Democrats' suspicion.

Schiff went on to question Vindman on his testimony behind closed doors, asking why he believed that Zelensky was “prepped” for the July 25 phone call—specifically on the topic of the Bidens and Burisma.

“It seemed unlikely that he would be familiar with a single company in the context of a call that was on the broader bilateral relationship,” Vindman said. “And it seemed to me he was either tracking this issue because it was in the press, or that he was otherwise prepared.”

EX-UKRAINE PROSECUTOR SAID HE WAS TOLD TO BACK OFF PROBE OF BIDEN-LINKED FIRM, FILES SHOW

When asked later about the omission of “Burisma” in the transcript, and ignoring some edits proposed by Vindman to the transcript before its release to the public, he said: “I didn’t see that as nefarious.”

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July phone call to Kiev. Trump pressed Zelensky, on the call, to open an investigation into the Bidens, specifically Hunter Biden's role on the board of Burisma, and former Vice President Joe Biden's role in pressuring former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the founder of the firm, Mykola Zlochevsky, the former minister of ecology and natural resources to Ukraine.

That call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a “quid pro quo” arrangement. Trump denies that."

At the same time, Cooper said she was under the impression the aid was restricted simply due to the Trump administration's concerns over ""corruption"" in Ukraine. Cooper testified she was never provided any other explanation for the hold, though others have asserted it was tied to the effort to extract an investigation of the Bidens.

Similarly, top State Department official David Hale, sitting alongside Cooper, testified that he was unaware of any ""nefarious"" motive by the Trump administration in withholding the aid. He said financial assistance to several other countries was withheld as well.

In a blow to GOP arguments that Ukraine was unaware of the aid holdup this summer, though, Cooper said that her staff had made her aware of ""two unclassified emails"" from the State Department, both from July 25. One email indicated that the Ukrainian Embassy and House Foreign Affairs Committee ""are asking about security assistance."" The second, also on July 25, said that ""the Hill knows about the FMF [Foreign Military Financing] situation to an extent, and so does the Ukrainian Embassy.""

It's unclear whether that meant Kiev was specifically aware of the hold at that time; the White House reportedly countered that this was merely an assumption.

But the emails would appear to suggest some awareness of a problem, and Cooper said her staff believed that Ukraine was at least “aware of the hold on security assistance” in August, though she couldn’t point to specific conversations in which it came up.

SONDLAND SAYS TRUMP EXPLICITLY RULED OUT QUID PRO QUO

Ukrainian Embassy staff, Cooper said, asked ""what is going on"" with their military aid. Although she stressed she had never talked to Trump about the matter, Cooper said she made an ""inference"" that the aid would be released if Ukraine issued a public statement on corruption.

Cooper's remarks updated her earlier testimony in a closed-door deposition and provided new information that Ukraine may have been aware of the aid suspension earlier than previously thought. During his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump suggested Zelensky investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine, including the former vice president's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid while the prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board.

""In July, I became aware of a hold being placed on the obligation of State Department's Foreign Military Financing and DoD's USAI funds,"" Cooper said. ""In a series of interagency meetings, I heard that the president had directed the Office of Management and Budget to hold the funds because of his concerns about corruption in Ukraine. Let me say at the outset that I have never discussed this or any other matter with the president and never heard directly from him about this matter.""

Separately, Cooper said she was ""proud"" that the Trump administration had agreed to equip Ukraine with anti-tank Javelin missiles, which the Obama administration had not provided.

""This was a very important decision to support Ukraine with this capability,"" Cooper said.

Cooper and Hale were testifying under subpoena Wednesday evening in Democrats' impeachment inquiry, after President Trump claimed vindication from European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland's blockbuster remarks earlier in the day.

Hale testified that aid was withheld from other countries besides Ukraine, including Honduras, Lebanon, and Pakistan. He said it was not unusual for the White House not to provide a specific explanation for why aid was being withheld. However, Hale said that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the White House was the only agency that didn't support lifting the hold on aid for Ukraine.

Under questioning from Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, Hale clarified that he was unaware of any ""nefarious"" motive for withholding aid to Ukraine, and had no information to suggest that there was a quid pro quo for investigations. He said it was a ""general impression"" at the State Department that Trump was skeptical of providing foreign aid.

In blockbuster testimony hours earlier, Sondland tied top Trump administration officials to a “potential quid pro quo” involving U.S. military aid to Ukraine and investigations desired by the president, but he acknowledged under cross-examination from Republicans that he never heard that from Trump -- saying he was making presumptions and the president expressly rejected any such arrangement. Democrats, though, argued that Sondland nevertheless described a quid pro quo arrangement in his testimony, suggesting Trump must have been involved.

Cooper testified last month that the Trump administration had pushed Ukraine to issue a public statement disavowing any efforts to influence U.S. elections -- but she stopped short of saying that officials wanted to include a reference to Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country.

Additionally, Cooper has testified that Pentagon officials began receiving ""phone calls from industry"" -- apparently referring to private companies that supply weapons and military hardware to the government -- after President Trump initiated a hold on military aid to Ukraine earlier this year.

Cooper also testified about Defense Department concerns that Trump's temporary withholding of military aid to Ukraine may have been illegal. The legalities likely regarded the issue of ""impoundment"" – the requirement that the president either had to spend the money or ""impound"" it. The White House was coming up against an impoundment deadline when it released the funds for Ukraine.

DOD OFFICIAL SAYS PRIVATE INDUSTRY PRESSURED PENTAGON TO RESUME AID TO UKRAINE

Cooper said Defense Department officials were concerned that Trump's decision would weaken a ""strategic partner.""

Under questioning on Wednesday, she reiterated that Ukraine is a vital strategic partner to the United States.

Meanwhile, Hale -- the State Department’s No. 3 official -- testified in a Nov. 6 closed-door deposition that no one in the Trump administration or any ""government channel"" ever mentioned Joe or Hunter Biden as a reason for withholding aid from Ukraine, according to a transcript of his remarks.

Democrats have argued that the White House improperly pressured Ukraine to look into the Bidens and Burisma, the natural gas company where Hunter Biden held a lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president.

George Kent, a State Department official who has also testified in the impeachment investigation, said he flagged Hunter Biden's apparent conflict of interest to the Obama administration at the time.

However, Hale said, he saw the Bidens referenced only in media reports -- as well as in a ""speculative"" email from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who testified last week.

Yovanovitch ""mentioned that Mayor [Rudy] Giuliani might have been motivated to sully Vice President Biden's reputation by reminding the world of the issue regarding his son's activities in Ukraine,"" Hale testified, referring to President Trump's personal attorney.

Hale and Cooper's testimony came shortly after Sondland tied top officials to the “potential quid pro quo” involving U.S. military aid to Ukraine and investigations desired by Trump – yet said he never heard that link from the president himself.

One of the key witnesses in the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry against Trump, Sondland claimed he kept Secretary of State Mike Pompeo aware of what was going on and said he specifically told Vice President Pence he ""had concerns"" the military aid to Ukraine ""had become tied"" to investigations -- though a Pence aide denied it. And he repeatedly lambasted Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s leading role in the administration’s Ukraine dealings.

""Everyone was in the loop,"" Sondland testified. ""It was no secret.""

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS BIDEN, BURISMA NOT MENTIONED REGARDING AID HOLDUP

He testified to a clear ""quid pro quo"" linking a White House meeting with Ukraine's president to the investigation request, even as he couched his language regarding the aid.

In comments touted by Trump later in the day, Sondland clarified: “I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement"" of investigations. He said he never personally heard Trump discuss preconditions. And at one point, he confirmed Trump told him, ""I want nothing.""

Throughout, Republicans sought to emphasize their view that the impeachment proceedings were fundamentally unfair. House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., kicked off the questioning in the afternoon hearing by focusing on the potential witnesses who had been blocked from appearing by Democrats.

""I’d like to take a moment to discuss a few of the people whose testimony has been deemed unacceptable for the American people to hear,"" Nunes said. ""The whistleblower is the key figure who started this entire impeachment charade by submitting a complaint against President Trump that relied on second-hand and third-hand information and media reports.""

Nunes then pointed to Alexandra Chalupa, whom he called a ""former operative for the Democratic National Committee who worked with officials of the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington D.C. in order to smear the Trump campaign.""

He concluded: ""Hunter Biden is another witness who the Democrats are sparing from cross-examination. His securing of an extremely well-paying job on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian company, Burisma, highlights the precise corruption problem in Ukraine that concerned not only President Trump, but all the witnesses we’ve interviewed. ... The Democrats have dismissed questions about Biden’s role at Burisma as conspiracy theories, yet they’re trying to impeach President Trump for having expressed concerns about the company."""

At Tuesday’s marathon session in Intelligence Committee proceedings, that continue on Wednesday and Thursday, other witnesses were invited to testify that they knew of no basis to believe Ukrainian officials had interfered in the 2016 election. Indeed, Democrats continued to press their disingenuous storyline that Ukraine could not have meddled in our presidential campaign because Russia did, as if it were not possible that both countries meddled – as it is virtually certain that both did, on opposite sides.

There has been a common thread in the testimony on these two subjects, potential Biden corruption and 2016 Ukrainian collusion with Democrats: There is no basis to believe, and none has been offered, that the witnesses Democrats permitted to be called have any relevant information about these matters.

SEN. THOM TILLIS: DEMOCRATS DENY TRUMP DUE PROCESS IN IMPEACHMENT PUSH

This testimony would not be allowed in a court proceeding under rules of evidence and due process, where witnesses are permitted to address only matters about which they have direct knowledge. If they only know what they’ve read in the papers, their testimony isn’t any more reliable than ours would be.

This is why, for all the formal trappings and somber tones, Democrats are running a kangaroo court.

The hearings are taking place under one-sided rules that enable Chairman Adam Schiff, a fierce partisan, to determine which witnesses are permitted to testify.

Republicans have asked to call such witnesses as Hunter Biden, Nellie Ohr, and Alexandra Chalupa. Biden the younger was lavishly compensated by a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, while his father was running Obama administration Ukraine policy and demanding that Kiev fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.

Ohr was a researcher at Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign opposition research arm that produced the bogus Steele dossier.

She testified in a 2018 House investigation that Fusion’s informants included Ukrainian parliamentarian Serhiy Leshchenko – an overt Clinton supporter.

In late 2018, a Ukrainian court found the Leshchenko and an official of Ukraine’s anti-corruption police meddled in the 2016 American election by, among other things, leaking information damaging to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort – who was forced to resign. Leschchenko was reportedly also a source for Chalupa, a Ukrainian-born DNC consultant and Hillary Clinton supporter.

For all the formal trappings and somber tones, Democrats are running a kangaroo court. The hearings are taking place under one-sided rules that enable Chairman Adam Schiff, a fierce partisan, to determine which witnesses are permitted to testify.

Schiff has denied Republicans the opportunity to call these witnesses, just as he has denied the GOP the ability to ask questions about the so-called whistleblower who instigated the Ukraine impeachment push (a CIA official who is known to have consulted with Schiff’s staff while preparing his complaint).

According to Schiff, the Republicans must not be permitted to question their preferred witnesses because possible Biden corruption and Ukrainian interference in the election for the benefit of Hillary Clinton are not relevant topics. The only matter in focus is President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s government – i.e., the slow-walking of defense aid to pressure Kyiv to conduct investigations “that would benefit Trump politically.”

This, of course, is absurd. In their tunnel vision, what Democrats call the investigations that “would benefit Trump politically” are precisely Biden corruption and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election.

Schiff & Co. mulishly insist that Trump was motivated by nothing other than his political fortunes in the 2020 campaign. Obviously, if the fact-finding inquiry is legitimate, the president and Republicans must be entitled to try to demonstrate that Trump had proper motivations.

Contrary to Schiff’s deceptive claim at the start of the inquiry (in his “parody” version of the July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call), the president was not asking Ukraine to “make up dirt on my political opponent.” There was abundant good-faith reason to suspect self-dealing by the Bidens.

There is, similarly, a bounty of evidence of Ukrainian interference in the election. The president reasonably contends that his interests were not so much in the politics of 2020 as in accountability for election-meddling in 2016 – a matter Democrats purport to be interested in when the country at issue is Russia and the bottom line helps them politically.

More to the point, though, while Schiff claims that Biden corruption and Ukrainian election meddling have no relevance to the inquiry, he is not conducting the hearings that way. To the contrary, Democrats are raising these matters at will … with witnesses of their choosing, who have no relevant information.

Democrats then use the witnesses’ professions that they’ve heard nothing of Biden corruption or Ukrainian collusion as if it were evidence that these things did not happen.

In a legitimate proceeding, you can’t have it both ways.

Schiff is plainly hiding the ball when he claims the defense the president and Republicans want to pursue is irrelevant, but then asks safe (i.e., uninformed) witnesses about this defense in order to pretend that there is no evidence.

The chairman’s own conduct shows that the Bidens and the 2016 shenanigans of Ukrainian officials are germane to the inquiry and would be probative of why President Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate. If the inquiry is to be something other than a political stunt masquerading as serious impeachment business, Republicans must be permitted to present their side of the story.

Democrats' pivotal week of Trump impeachment hearings kicks off, as contradictions in testimony surface

Beginning Tuesday morning, in a rush of five public hearings ahead of the Thanksgiving recess, eight witnesses -- including several who have provided inconsistent accounts of key events -- are set to testify over three days in what could be a make-or-break week in House Democrats' impeachment investigation.

Less than 24 hours before the proceedings were set to be gaveled in Tuesday at 9 a.m. ET, President Trump floated the idea of testifying, rather than tweeting, during the inquiry. A top Republican called for a last-minute postponement, citing secretive new developments behind closed doors. And, the Trump campaign has pointed out apparent inconsistencies in some witness testimony already on the record.

A key impeachment figure: Though he's not slated to testify until Wednesday, the key witness expected to come up throughout the week is Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe.

Testifying Tuesday: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, is scheduled to testify Tuesday morning. He has testified behind closed doors that Sondland cited a discussion with White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney when pushing Ukrainian officials to open the investigations that Trump wanted into the 2016 U.S. presidential election and into potential 2020 election opponent Joe Biden.

National Security Council [NSC] official Tim Morrison, the outgoing senior director of European and Russian affairs and White House deputy assistant, is to testify Tuesday afternoon. In his closed-door deposition, which Democrats released over the weekend, Morrison said Trump didn't want tax dollars funding Ukrainian corruption, and remarked that he wasn't concerned Trump's calls with Ukraine's leader were tied to his political interests. Republicans have further noted that Morrison has testified privately that he ""had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s judgment"" and had heard concerns that Vindman was a leaker.

In other Trump impeachment inquiry developments: David Hale, the State Department’s No. 3 official, testified in a Nov. 6 closed-door deposition that no one in the Trump administration or any ""government channel"" ever mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter as a reason for withholding aid from Ukraine, according to a transcript of his remarks released late Monday by House Democrats in their impeachment inquiry. Hale is scheduled to testify publicly Wednesday.

Also late Monday, Democrats released testimony from State Department official David Holmes, who said in his Nov. 15 deposition that the conversation he overheard between Trump and Sondland during a lunch in Ukraine was so distinctive — even extraordinary — that nobody needed to refresh his memory. He is set to testify publicly Thursday.

Criminal charges expected against Epstein guards: report

Two correctional officers responsible for guarding Jeffrey Epstein when he took his own life are expected to face criminal charges this week for falsifying prison records, according to a report. The federal charges could come as soon as Tuesday, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The charges would be the first in connection with the death of Epstein, the wealthy financier who died Aug. 10 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York while awaiting trial on charges of sexually abusing teenage girls.

Meanwhile, on Monday, a woman who came forward with accusations of child sex abuse against Epstein described a disturbing encounter with the now-deceased sex offender, said she took former President Bill Clinton’s seat on the “Lolita Express,” and noted bizarre bedroom floors made of mattress foam and being encouraged to cry after sex with the disgraced money man.

Hong Kong police surround 100 protesters at university

About 100 anti-government protesters remained holed up at a Hong Kong university Tuesday as a police siege of the campus entered its third day. City leader Carrie Lam said 600 people had left the Hong Kong Polytechnic campus, including 200 who are under 18 years old. Police have surrounded the university and are arresting anyone who leaves. Groups of protesters made several attempts to escape Monday, including sliding down hoses to waiting motorcycles, but it wasn’t clear if they evaded arrest, according to the Associated Press.

Universities became the latest battleground last week in the Hong Kong protest movement, now in its fifth month

According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg grabbed the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts were tied for second – with each at 15 percent.

The survey indicated Sen. Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – at 9 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota registered at 6 percent in the poll, with billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and grassroots organizer Tom Steyer at 5 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each were at 3 percent and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the survey stood at 1 percent or less.

The 37-year old Buttigieg – the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls – was once seen as the longest of long-shots for the nomination, but he surged in the spring to middle-tier status and he’s soared this autumn to reach the top-tier of contenders. He’s skyrocketed 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September.

Warren’s plunged 10 points since the previous poll, with Biden nose-diving 9 points.

“With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire’s Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

He’s not kidding. A Quinnipiac University Poll in New Hampshire conducted earlier this month indicated Biden at 20 percent, with Warren at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 15 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And, a University of New Hampshire-CNN poll conducted late last month showed Sanders at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Levesque emphasized that in the Saint Anselm poll, “Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76 percent having a favorable impression of him versus only 11 percent unfavorable.”

Buttigieg’s net favorability of 65 percent easily bested his top rivals for the nomination.

But, the reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent said they remained undecided and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters do change their minds, Warren may benefit. She topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.

The poll’s release came with two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary.

A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.

The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., jumped into the presidential nomination race. He stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.

The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid. Ninety-one percent said they would discourage 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from running again. But, more than four in ten said they would encourage former first lady Michelle Obama to run."

One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans.

Vindman said he spoke with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official, immediately raising apparent questions over whether he could have been a source of information for the anonymous whistleblower who reported the call. He said both individuals are ""cleared U.S. government officials with the appropriate need to know.”

RON JOHNSON CASTS DOUBT ON VINDMAN TESTIMONY, SAYS NSC OFFICIAL FITS 'PROFILE' OF NEVER-TRUMPER

Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., interjected to express concern that Republicans were trying to out the whistleblower through the questioning. After consulting his attorney, Vindman said, ""Per the advice of my counsel, I’ve been advised not to answer the specific questions about members of the intelligence community.""

Still, Vindman told lawmakers, “I do not know who the whistleblower is.”

The tension between Vindman and Republicans was evident after the revelation: at one point, when California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, called him “Mr. Vindman,” the witness replied, ""it's Lt. Col. Vindman.""

The impeachment inquiry has focused on a possible link between military aid to Ukraine and investigations sought by Trump pertaining to the Bidens and Democrats. The questions arose after a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky led to a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine into helping him.

At one point, Vindman described his reaction to Trump’s call as one of “shock.” “Frankly, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing,” he testified. “In certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out.”

Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ""demand"" and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it “would be interpreted as a partisan play.” He also emphasized that he reported his concerns “out of a sense of duty.”

The White House downplayed the hearing, though, as a debate over two individuals’ personal opinions about a call that Americans can read for themselves. During the hearing, Trump tweeted a video calling the inquiry a ""charade."" He also spoke to reporters at the White House, saying, ""Republicans are absolutely killing it. Because it’s a big scam.” He added: ""What’s going on is a disgrace.""

Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been “excluded” from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position. “I was concerned by the call. What I heard was inappropriate,” Vindman testified. He also said, “It is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent.”

In another revelation, Vindman said Oleksandr Danylyuk, Zelensky's former national security adviser, asked Vindman to be the defense minister in Ukraine on a number of occasions, including three times around the time of the inauguration.

Vindman called the request ""comical"" and said he didn't leave the door open on the offer. ""Every single time I dismissed it,"" he said, adding that he notified the chain of command back home.

Meanwhile, the other morning witness, Vice President Pence aide Jennifer Williams, also expressed concern about Trump's call with Zelensky, saying, “I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.” Williams, a State Department official assigned to Pence's office, said she inserted the White House's readout of the call in Pence's briefing book.

Both Vindman and Williams testified Tuesday they never learned why the hold on the military aid to Ukraine was eventually lifted.

In his opening remarks, the top Democrat on the panel, Schiff, defended both witnesses against recent attacks, telling Williams “we all saw the president’s tweet about you on Sunday afternoon” accusing her of being a “Never Trumper.” Williams later rejected that term, under questioning Tuesday.

When Vindman was asked if he's a ""Never Trumper,"" he described himself as ""Never partisan.""

Addressing Vindman -- who wore his Army uniform to Tuesday's hearing -- Schiff said, “I note that you have shed blood for America, and we owe you an immense debt of gratitude.” Vindman referenced his family’s history of moving from the Soviet Union to the United States 40 years ago, saying appearing for testimony in Russia would “surely cost me my life.” But addressing his father, Vindman said today, “Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.”

At another point, Vindman testified that he knew he was ""taking a risk"" by speaking about the Trump call. ""This is America. Here, right matters,"" he said to applause from some in the room.

Republicans on the committee dismissed the testimony, with Nunes calling the Democrat-led inquiry a “partisan frenzy"" while blasting the media coverage over what he called a ""fevered rush to tarnish and remove"" Trump. He referenced recent media reports that Democrats have shifted the wording they use to describe the allegations against the president from “quid pro quo” to “bribery” after conducting focus groups with voters. At the end of the hearing, he said there was ""no evidence"" presented for impeachment.

Republicans also lamented how Democrats won't grant their request to call the anonymous whistleblower who ignited the impeachment probe to testify to lawmakers. “Now that the whistleblower has successfully kickstarted impeachment, he has disappeared from the story—as if the Democrats put the whistleblower in their own witness protection program,” Nunes said.

GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, at another point, told Schiff ""no one believes"" him when he says he doesn't know who the whistleblower is.

Later Tuesday, two other witnesses will appear before lawmakers: former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker and NSC outgoing senior director of European and Russian affairs Tim Morrison.

WHAT IS BURISMA HOLDINGS? THE STORY BEHIND THE SCANDAL-TIED UKRAINE FIRM THAT HIRED HUNTER BIDEN

Vindman is viewed as a key witness for Democrats. In his testimony, Vindman has said he recalled U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland saying during White House meetings on July 10 that Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens to receive the aid.

Hunter Biden was a board member of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, which had been under investigation before then-Vice President Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in charge.

Until Tuesday, none of the witnesses who have testified at the public hearings had first-hand knowledge of the president's thinking, which Republicans have used to cast doubt on Democrats' allegations. But Vindman, Williams, and Morrison all listened in on Trump's July 25 phone call.

He has gone from a small town upbringing to become the inquisitor in chief for the Democrats’ effort to impeach President Trump.

While his home state of California can’t keep the lights on and while fires burn, Schiff could be found in front of every available camera since Trump took office, claiming to have evidence that the president had colluded with Russia in order to get elected. Despite Schiff’s constant promises to that effect, not even Special Counsel Robert Mueller could bail Schiff out of his false statements.

Russian conspiracies have now turned to Ukrainian stories – and once again Schiff is at the center of it all. After the abject media failures of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and the unfortunate death of Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Schiff finds himself right where he wants to be – in the spotlight on impeachment.

REP. LEE ZELDIN CALLS ADAM SCHIFF 'SICK,' SLAMS HIS 'DISGUSTING RHETORIC' ON IMPEACHMENT

The glare of the lights, however, has not convinced Schiff that he should run his impeachment inquiry in a just way with due process. Never in our history has there been such a one-sided inquiry in which only the chairman – and Schiff alone – decides what witnesses shall appear before his committee.

In the past, both parties had subpoena rights. Now, however, Republicans have been effectively denied the ability to counter the made-for-television story Schiff wants the country to believe about this president.

Moreover, Schiff and his partisan counsel felt free to ask their early witnesses questions about the activities of the former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter – apparently believing the Bidens would be exonerated.

Those witnesses indicated concerns about the actions of Hunter Biden and exposed the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into the Ukrainian natural gas company that was paying Hunter Biden to serve on its board at the time Joe Biden got the prosecutor in charge of the investigation fired. But Schiff is refusing to allow Republicans to call witnesses to delve deeper into that story. This is politics folks – not justice.

Schiff is also covering for the so-called whistleblower. Schiff claims it is for the safety of that person. However, it is more likely Schiff is concerned with his own possibly illegal activity.

The law requires any so-called whistleblower from the intelligence community (where the whistleblower on Ukraine has been reported as working) to submit his or her complaint to the director of national intelligence before meeting with any congressional staff – in this case, staffers working for Schiff.

The purpose of the law is simple. The director of national intelligence, who deals with national security, should receive unvarnished information – not politically motivated stories.

That didn’t happen. Instead, the so-called whistleblower met with Schiff’s people and was coached before making his complaint to the director of national intelligence. That could well be a crime and Schiff is obstructing any inquiry into that crime. Not only that, Schiff patently lied about his committee’s early contact with the so-called whistleblower – also a form of obstruction of justice.

I should note that Schiff isn’t ignoring California altogether. To the contrary, rather than attend one of the secret depositions of witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, Schiff jetted to California last weekend to give a speech at the California Democratic Convention.

Given the miscarriage of justice Schiff has undertaken over the last years, it was no surprise that, in front of the cameras, Schiff claimed Trump was a “charlatan.”

There was one surprise in his invective, however. Schiff proclaimed the following: “We will send that charlatan in the White House back to the golden throne he came from …. And you know why? Because we vote. How do we build another big, beautiful wave? We vote.”

Think about that statement.

Clearly, Schiff knows that this inquiry he is running – which is firmly undemocratic and violates due process – is going nowhere, and neither is President Trump. Schiff knows the Senate will reject this latest resistance to the results of the 2016 election. It also means that Schiff knows this impeachment inquiry is just a political exercise meant to get attention for himself and to motivate Democratic voters in the 2020 elections.

The irony of Adam Schiff is that the congressional seat Schiff he holds had been previously occupied by Rep. James Rogan – one of the managers of the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Rogan had been targeted for defeat by Democrats because of the role he played in that impeachment.

Given the constitutional implications of his acts, and the damage being done to the Republic by Schiff and his cohorts, the one person who should be targeted for defeat in 2020 is Adam Schiff.

On Wednesday morning, it'll be Sondland's turn to testify as the impeachment probe's most anticipated witness, less than 24 hours after Republicans declared total victory in Tuesday afternoon's hearings. But it remained unclear whether the wealthy hotelier-turned-diplomat would pose a ""problem"" for Democrats, Republicans, or all of the above.

Sondland is more directly entangled than any witness yet in the president’s alleged efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's dealings in the country, including Biden's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid. Yet Sondland has already amended his testimony once -- “I now do recall,” he said, talking to Ukraine about anti-corruption investigations — and has frustrated Democrats' efforts to build a consistent narrative of misconduct by the president.

Most notably, Sondland previously testified behind closed doors that Trump directly told him there were to be ""no quid pro quos of any kind"" with Ukraine, and that he didn’t recall any conversations with the White House about withholding military assistance in return for Ukraine helping with the president’s political campaign.

Then, William Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires for Ukraine, told lawmakers that Sondland himself said ""everything"" — a White House visit for Ukraine's new leader and the release of military aid to the former Soviet republic — was contingent on a public announcement of investigations into the 2016 election and into Ukraine gas company Burisma Holdings. (Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board of Burisma, despite having little relevant experience, while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president.)

Weeks later, after testimony from Taylor and Morrison placed him at the center of key discussions, Sondland amended his testimony and claimed his recollection had been ""refreshed."" Sondland said he now could recall a September conversation in which he told an aide to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that military aid likely would not occur until Ukraine made public announcements about corruption investigations. Sondland said he came to ""understand"" that arrangement from other sources.

Additionally, Sondland has insisted he knew acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney only well enough to wave and say hello. He said he may have spoken to him once or twice on the phone, but not about Ukraine. Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an NSC official, has testified Sondland cited a discussion with Mulvaney when pushing Ukrainian officials to open the investigations that Trump wanted into alleged 2016 U.S. presidential election interference and the Bidens.

MORRISON, VOLKER UNDERCUT DEMS' CLAIMS OF BRIBERY, AS GOP DECLARES VICTORY: 'A GREAT DAY FOR THE PRESIDENT'

Separately, Fiona Hill, another White House national security official, said Sondland often talked of meetings with Mulvaney. In a further link between the two men, she quoted the-then National Security Adviser John Bolton as telling her he didn’t want to be part of “whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney were cooking up.” Hill is to testify Thursday.

Trump, meanwhile, has recently tried to suggest that he barely knows his hand-picked ambassador, but Sondland has said he has spoken several times with the president and was acting on his direction. Sondland routinely bragged about his proximity to Trump and drew alarm from the foreign service and national security apparatus as part of an irregular channel of diplomacy led by the president’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

Last week, State Department official David Holmes revealed one of Sondland's interactions with Trump, saying he recalled it “vividly.”

The political counselor was having lunch with Sondland in Kiev when the ambassador dialed up the president on his cell phone and Holmes could hear Trump’s voice.

“I then heard President Trump ask, quote, ‘So he’s going to do the investigation?’” Holmes testified. “Ambassador Sondland replied that ‘He’s going to do it,’ adding that President Zelensky will, quote, ‘do anything you ask him to.’”

Holmes testified that he told ""a number of friends of mine"" about the call because it was ""like, a really extraordinary thing"" to be ""part of"" a lunch in which ""someone called the president."" He insisted he didn't go into detail about the call while he boasted about it, but estimated that he may have told as many as six friends.

Sondland was known for telling others ""he was in charge of Ukraine"" despite being the U.S. envoy in Brussels, Hill testified. (Trump campaign officials have noted that several Democrat witnesses appeared to suggest that they were in charge of Ukraine policy, not the president.)

""And I asked, well, on whose authority?” said Hill. ""And he said, the president.""

Also testifying on Wednesday are Pentagon official Laura Cooper and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Hale.

Their appearances will follow the testimony Tuesday of four national security and diplomatic officials, including two GOP witnesses -- Morrison and former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker -- who largely undercut Democrats' primary arguments for impeachment.

Both Volker and Morrison repeatedly denied that there was any bribery or extortion by the president in his call with Zelensky. Their answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats as their impeachment inquiry continued into its second week of public hearings: With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years.

""Ambassador Volker, I presume you got a readout of the call,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y, asked at one point. ""Was there any reference to withholding aid? Any reference to bribery? Any reference to quid pro quo? Any reference to extortion?""

""No, there was not,"" Volker replied, again and again.

Shortly after that moment, President Trump tweeted, ""A great day for Republicans, a great day for our Country!""

""Kind of hard to prove a corrupt quid pro quo theory when the key U.S. policy people, plus the Ukrainians, were never aware of such an arrangement,"" Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw added late Tuesday, noting that Ukraine's president has said he felt no pressure from Trump to open any probes. ""Can we go back to governing now, that’d be great thanks.""

Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan told Fox News, ""This was a very good day for Republicans, for our president.""

However, Volker did help some aspects of House Democrats' case. He shifted his own account of a July 10 White House meeting to say Sondland did, in fact, discuss investigations with the visiting Ukrainians. “I think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,” Volker said.

Volker said Sondland had raised the idea of investigations “in a generic way,"" and that Bolton immediately ended the meeting.

A series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and other leaders in which they discussed a need for Ukraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma Holdings. Volker also said he didn't initially realize the connection between a Trump-sought investigation of Burisma and the Bidens,

Volker went on to testify that during a September dinner with top Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak, he’d discouraged Ukraine from trying to prosecute the country’s previous president. Volker says he warned it would sow deep societal divisions.

Volker said Yermak quipped in response, “You mean like asking us to investigate Clinton and Biden?” Volker claimed he didn’t “quite understand” the head-turning remark and was “kind of puzzled” by it.

Burisma had been under investigation before then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in charge. In his call with Zelensky, Trump suggested the Ukrainians look into the circumstances of the prosecutor's termination, including Joe Biden's boast that he had the prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in critical aid.

Another witness who testified earlier Tuesday was a career Army officer who described Trump’s call with Zelensky as “improper.”

""Frankly, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing,"" he testified. ""In certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out.""

Vindman told lawmakers it was his “duty” to report his concerns about the call, as he deflected Republican attacks, including from the White House on his loyalty and career in public service.

OPINION: VINDMAN NEEDS TO BE FIRED, AFTER TESTIMONY REVEALS HIS INSUBORDINATION AND ALLEGED PROPENSITY FOR LEAKS

It wasn’t the first time Vindman had registered his concerns over Ukraine policy. He testified about the July 10 meeting at the White House when Sondland told visiting Ukraine officials they would need to “deliver” before the administration would agree to a meeting Zelenskiy wanted with Trump.

“Ambassador Sondland referred to investigations into the Bidens and Burisma in 2016,” Vindman testified.

However, Vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by Republican Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Vindman testified earlier in the day that he did not discuss his concerns about Trump's July phone call with Morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable.

Under questioning from Wenstrup, Morrison confirmed that Vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that Vindman testified Morrison was unreachable.

Arizona GOP Rep. Paul Gosar offered a blunt assessment of Vindman's testimony, tweeting: ""I think people need a reminder: the democrats said they would impeach starting in December 2016–before @realDonaldTrump was even sworn in. This is a hearing looking for a reason. It’s corrupt and immoral. The dude in the uniform is a seditionist.""

Morrison, meanwhile, also said he had heard others express concern that Vindman was a leaker, and could not be trusted with key information. Asked about that allegation, Vindman read from a glowing performance review that described him as an exemplary officer.

In a particularly remarkable moment, Vindman testified that he was asked to serve as Ukraine’s defense minister three times -- but repeatedly denied the offers -- when he traveled to Kiev for the inauguration of Ukraine's president. Oleksander Danylyuk, the former Chairman of the National Security and Defence Council in Ukraine, reportedly said on Tuesday the offer was ""clearly a joke.""

At the White House, Trump said he had watched part of the day’s testimony and slammed the ongoing impeachment hearings as a “disgrace.” Over the weekend, Trump assailed Vice President Pence aide Jennifer Williams as part of the “Never Trumpers” who oppose his presidency, though there is no indication she has shown any partisanship. Williams was critical of Trump's call with Zelensky.

However, in his testimony, Morrison suggested the impeachment brouhaha was predictable partisan politics as usual.

""I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate,"" Morrison said in his opening statement on Tuesday. ""My fears have been realized.""

While discussing the details of the call, which was previously described by another official, Sondland spoke to the casual nature of his communications with the president. The moment in question concerned his assurance to Trump that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""loves"" him.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS: LIVE UPDATES FROM DAY FOUR

""[Holmes] also testified that you confirmed to President Trump that you were in Ukraine at the time and that President Zelensky, quote, 'loves your ass,' unquote,"" Goldman stated. ""Do you recall saying that?""

""Yeah, sounds like something I would say,"" Sondland responded, drawing laughs from those in attendance. ""That's how President Trump and I communicate. A lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter.""

Sondland later explained that this was his way of letting Trump know that Zelensky was very amicable in a meeting Sondland had recently had with the Ukrainian leader.

""He was just very willing to work with the United States, and was being very amicable, and so putting it in Trump-speak by saying he loves your ass, he'll do whatever you want, and that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.""

Others have said that the two of them specifically discussed investigations on that call, apparently referring to Trump's desire for politically advantageous probes from Kiev.

Sondland's testimony began the fourth day of public hearings in the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry of Trump, which thus far has centered on whether or not Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic activities in 2016 as well as former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while the elder Biden was in office.

Sondland testified that it was his impression that Trump would not meet with Zelensky at the White House unless Zelensky publicly declared that he was conducting investigations of the Democrats and Burisma. Democrats have accused Trump of also withholding military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get the investigations. Sondland said he never directly heard from Trump that this was the case, although he did say he never got a clear answer as to why the aid was held back and presumed they were linked.

Sondland did recall that at one point he asked Trump what he wants from Ukraine.

""He just said, 'I want nothing, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo,'"" Sondland recalled.

Republicans have defended Trump by noting that the aid was eventually released without any announcement or investigations on Zelensky's end."

Less than 24 hours before the proceedings are set to be gaveled in at 9 a.m. ET, President Trump floated the idea of testifying, rather than tweeting, during the inquiry. A top Republican called for a last-minute postponement, citing secretive new developments behind closed doors. And, the Trump campaign has pointed out apparent inconsistencies in some testimony already on the record.

The key witness to focus on amid the rapid-fire series of developments is likely to be Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, the wealthy donor who has bragged about his proximity to President Trump -- and who repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Though he won't testify until Wednesday, Sondland will loom large in Tuesday morning's proceedings.

DEM WITNESS ADMITS HE BLABBED ABOUT OVERHEARD TRUMP CALL, CALLS IT 'LIKE, AN EXTRAORDINARY THING'

In part, that's because Sondland previously testified behind closed doors that Trump directly told him there were to be ""no quid pro quos of any kind"" with Ukraine, and that he didn’t recall any conversations with the White House about withholding military assistance in return for Ukraine helping with the president’s political campaign. Democrats have alleged that Trump held up the aid to ensure a public probe into the Ukraine business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Then, William Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires for Ukraine, told lawmakers that Sondland himself said ""everything"" — a White House visit for Ukraine's new leader and the release of military aid to the former Soviet republic — was contingent on a public announcement of investigations into the 2016 election and into Ukraine gas company Burisma. (Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board of Burisma, despite having little relevant experience, while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president.)

Weeks later, after testimony from Taylor and National Security Council [NSC] official Tim Morrison placed him at the center of key discussions, Sondland suddenly amended his testimony and claimed his recollection had been ""refreshed."" Sondland said he now could recall a September conversation in which he told an aide to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that military aid likely would not occur until Ukraine made public announcements about corruption investigations. Sondland said he came to ""understand"" that arrangement from other sources.

Morrison, the NSC's outgoing senior director of European and Russian affairs and White House deputy assistant, is to testify Tuesday afternoon. In his closed-door deposition, which Democrats released over the weekend, Morrison said Trump didn't want tax dollars funding Ukrainian corruption, and remarked that he wasn't concerned Trump's calls with Ukraine's leader were tied to his political interests.

'CANNOT BE TRUE' -- MAJOR INCONSISTENCY EMERGES IN BILL TAYLOR'S TESTIMONY

Additionally, Sondland has insisted he knew acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney only well enough to wave and say hello — and that’s about it. He said he may have spoken to him once or twice on the phone, but not about Ukraine. Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, has testified Sondland cited a discussion with Mulvaney when pushing Ukrainian officials to open the investigations that Trump wanted into the 2016 U.S. presidential election and into potential 2020 election opponent Joe Biden.

Vindman is scheduled to testify Tuesday morning. Republicans have further noted that Morrison has testified privately that he ""had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s judgment"" and had heard concerns that Vindman was a leaker.

Separately, Fiona Hill, another White House national security official, said Sondland often talked of meetings with Mulvaney. In a further link between the two men, she quoted the-then National Security Adviser John Bolton as telling her he didn’t want to be part of “whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney were cooking up.”

Hill is to testify Thursday morning, after Sondland's appearance.

She also has recalled scolding Sondland face-to-face after tense July 10 meetings at the White House involving U.S. and Ukrainian leaders, reminding him of the need for proper procedures and the role of the National Security Council. She said Bolton ""stiffened"" when Sondland brought up investigations in front of the Ukrainian officials and immediately ended the meeting. Vindman, too, said he made clear to Sondland his comments were inappropriate ""and that we were not going to get involved in investigations.""

But, Sondland said he didn't recall a cross word from Hill, Bolton or anyone else about his Ukraine work. In fact, he said, Bolton signed off on the whole Ukraine strategy.

""Indeed, over the spring and summer of 2019, I received nothing but cordial responses from Ambassador Bolton and Dr. Hill. Nothing was ever raised to me about any concerns regarding our Ukrainian policy,"" Sondland said. When Hill left her post in government, he recalled, she gave him a big hug and told him to keep in touch.

GOP REP CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS TO BE POSTPONED IMMEDIATELY, CITING NEW DEVELOPMENTS

Testimony from multiple witnesses has centered on the July 10 White House meetings. Several of those present said Sondland, on that day, explicitly connected a coveted White House visit to the country’s public announcement of corruption investigations. It was something he just “blurted out,” Hill said, recalling him saying: ""Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff for a meeting if these 'investigations in the energy sector start.""

Vindman, too, said he remembered Sondland saying that day that the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens.

But, Sondland told a different version of the day. He said he didn’t recall mentioning Ukraine investigations or Burisma. The only conflict he described from that day was a disagreement on whether to schedule a call between Trump and Zelensky promptly. He was in favor.

Sondland likely won't be the only witness in the impeachment inquiry facing credibility concerns this week. Late Monday, the Trump campaign pointed out that State Department official David Holmes' testimony concerning Trump's call with Sondland -- in which Trump allegedly called for ""investigations"" -- seemed to conflict with Taylor's remarks under oath.

Taylor, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee last Wednesday, said he had just learned about the July phone call this month. But, Holmes' timeline of events, according to a written statement from his closed-door interview, seemed to depart from Taylor's -- saying he notified Taylor of the call shortly after it happened.

Holmes is slated to testify Thursday. Late Monday, Democrats released testimony from Holmes' Nov. 15 closed-door deposition in which he stated that the phone call he overheard between Trump and Sondland during a lunch in Ukraine was so distinctive — even extraordinary — that nobody needed to refresh his memory.

""I've never seen anything like this,"" Holmes told House investigators, ""someone calling the president from a mobile phone at a restaurant, and then having a conversation of this level of candor, colorful language. There's just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly.""

Holmes also testified that he told ""a number of friends of mine"" about the call because it was ""like, a really extraordinary thing"" to be ""part of"" a lunch in which ""someone called the president."" He insisted he didn't go into detail about the call while he boasted about it, but estimated that he may have told as many as six friends.

""It was, like, a really extraordinary thing."" — State Department official David Holmes, on overhearing Trump's call with Gordon Sondland in a restaurant

For his part, Trump has insisted Democrats had been out to get him any way they could. The president has noted, for example, that The Washington Post discussed the push to impeach Trump just minutes after he took office in 2017 -- and, the Ukraine whistleblower's lawyer openly called for a ""coup"" and impeachment around the same time. Prominent Democrats, including Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, rang in 2019 with colorful vows to impeach Trump.

House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., sent a letter Monday to the panel's chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., panning what he called the ""Democrat impeachment crusade"" for lacking the ""due process protections afforded in all past presidential impeachments, including those protections afforded to President Clinton by Republicans.""

Collins continued, ""It is an unfair process for many other reasons, chief among them the fact that minority questions are not being answered in depositions and the president’s counsel has had no voice in the fact-gathering phase of this impeachment inquiry.""

WHY IS SONDLAND WORRYING BOTH DEMS AND GOP?

For his part, Trump revealed Monday he was considering an invitation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to provide his own account to the House, possibly by submitting written testimony. That would be an unprecedented moment in this constitutional showdown between the two branches of U.S. government.

Trump tweeted: “Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!”

But, a Democratic official working on the impeachment probe told Fox News on Monday that they weren't taking the offer seriously.

""If President Trump were serious about providing information to our investigation, he’d stop obstructing his administration from providing documents and people to provide testimony,"" the official said. ""There are people who could testify, including John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney. This is not serious. We're not going to play that game.""

Tuesday’s sessions at the House Intelligence Committee are to start with Vindman, an Army officer at the National Security Council, and Jennifer Williams, his counterpart at Vice President Mike Pence’s office.

The witnesses, both foreign policy experts, said they listened with concern as Trump spoke on July 25 with the newly elected Ukraine president. The government whistleblower’s complaint about that call led the House to launch the impeachment investigation.

Vindman and Williams said they were uneasy as Trump talked to Zelensky about investigations of the Bidens. Vindman also said he reported the call to NSC lawyers.

Williams said she found it ""unusual"" and inserted the White House's readout of it in Pence's briefing book.

""I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen,"" Vindman said, adding there was ""no doubt"" what Trump wanted.

WATCH: BANNON SAYS HE PUSHED FOR ALLEGED WHISTLEBLOWER TO BE OUSTED FROM NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, CITING LEAK CONCERNS

Pence's role remained unclear. ""I just don't know if he read it,"" Williams testified in a closed-door House interview.

Vindman also lodged concerns about Sondland, relaying details from the explosive July 10 meeting at the White House and saying the ambassador pushed visiting Ukraine officials for the investigations Trump wanted.

""He was talking about the 2016 elections and an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma,"" Vindman testified.

Morrison referred to Burisma as a ""bucket of issues"" -- the Bidens, Democrats, investigations -- from which he had tried to ""stay away.""

Along with Volker's testimony, their accounts further complicated Sondland’s testimony and characterized Trump as more central to the action.

Sondland met with a Zelensky aide on the sidelines of a Sept. 1 gathering in Warsaw, Poland, and Morrison, who was watching the encounter from across the room, testified that the ambassador told him moments later he pushed the Ukrainian for the Burisma investigation as a way for Ukraine to gain access to the military funds.

WH OFFICIAL SUES POLITICO, TARGETS SCHIFF'S ROLE IN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS

Volker provided investigators with a package of text messages with Sondland and Taylor, who said he grew alarmed at the possible linkage of the investigations to the aid.

Republicans are certain to mount a more aggressive attack on all the witnesses as the inquiry has reached closer into the White House.

The president has aimed to see a robust defense by his GOP allies on Capitol Hill, but so far they have offered a changing strategy as the fast-moving probe spilled into public view.

Republicans first complained the witnesses were offering only hearsay, without first-hand knowledge of Trump’s actions. But, as more witnesses came forward bringing testimony closer to Trump, they more recently have said the president was innocent because the military money eventually was released.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., during an appearance Monday in Louisville, Kentucky, acknowledged the House will likely vote to impeach the president.

But, the GOP leader said he ""can't imagine"" a scenario in which there would be enough support in the Senate -- a supermajority 67 votes -- to remove Trump from office.

McConnell said House Democrats ""are seized with 'Trump derangement syndrome,'"" a catch-phrase used by the president's supporters. He said the inquiry seemed ""particularly ridiculous since we're going into the presidential election and the American people will have an opportunity in the very near future to decide who they want the next president to be.""

Pelosi, though, said the president could speak for himself.

""If he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it,"" she said in a CBS News interview that aired Sunday. Trump ""could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants,"" she said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump ""should come to the committee and testify under oath, and he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath."" He said the White House's insistence on blocking witnesses from cooperating raised the question: ""What is he hiding?""

The White House has instructed officials not to appear, and most have received congressional subpoenas to compel their testimony.

Those appearing in public already have given closed-door interviews to investigators, and transcripts from those depositions largely have been released.

Sondland is to appear Wednesday. The wealthy hotelier, who donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, was the only person interviewed to date who had direct conversations with the president about the Ukraine situation.

Morrison said Sondland and Trump had spoken about five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 — the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released.

Trump has said he barely knew Sondland.

Besides Sondland, the committee is set to hear Wednesday from Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, and David Hale.

Hale, the State Department’s No. 3 official, testified in a Nov. 6 closed-door deposition that no one in the Trump administration or any ""government channel"" ever mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter as a reason for withholding aid from Ukraine, according to a transcript of his remarks released late Monday by House Democrats.

Hale said he saw the Bidens referenced only in media reports -- as well as in a ""speculative"" email from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who testified last week. Hale is scheduled to testify publicly Wednesday.

Although Jennifer Williams, Vindman's counterpart at Vice President Mike Pence’s office, said her experience had not changed, Vindman said his had.

""Since the report on July 25, as I stated, I did notice I was being excluded from several meetings that would have been appropriate for my position,"" he said.

SCHIFF SCRAMBLES TO STOP WHISTLEBLOWER FROM BEING NAMED, AFTER VINDMAN REVEALS INTEL CONTACT

Speier pressed Vindman on whether or not those actions could be construed as retaliation against him.

""So in some respects, then, there have been reprisals?"" she inquired.

Vindman responded: ""I'm not sure if I can make that judgment. I can say it was out of the course of normal affairs to not have me participate in some of these events.""

Democrats have drawn attention to what they characterize as unfair treatment of former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch by Trump and his associates, including alleged ""intimidation"" when Trump live-tweeted criticism during her appearance in a public hearing on Friday.

The claim that Vindman is being left out of meetings could be used by Democrats to build their case that the Trump administration is attempting to prevent potential witnesses from cooperating with the inquiry.

Tuesday’s sessions at the House Intelligence Committee started with Vindman and Williams, both foreign policy experts who previously said they listened with concern as Trump spoke on July 25 with the newly elected Ukraine president. An intelligence community whistleblower’s complaint about that call led the House to launch the impeachment investigation, which was eventually formalized in a resolution passed before the beginning of public hearings last week.

Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Burisma Holdings and a widely challenged conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 elections against Trump. Burisma is a Ukranian gas company that 2020 Democratic contender Joe Biden's son, Hunter, previously worked for as a board member. Biden had little known qualifications to hold such a position. The senior Biden, while vice president, later demanded the removal of a prosecutor who was looking into Burisma, although that came after the Burisma investigation was closed.

Democrats have accused Trump of withholding an Oval Office meeting and almost $400 million in military aid from Zelensky as leverage to persuade him to pursue those investigations, which would have been politically beneficial to Trump.

Former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and Tim Morrison, who was previously the top advisor on the National Security Council handling Russian and European affairs, will testify in another public impeachment hearing Tuesday in the second session of a week that will see nine witnesses testify over five hearings.

He says he's ready.

“We are making sure we are ready for anything that will come,” the South Bend, Ind., mayor said when asked on Monday how he was preparing for the fifth-round debate in Atlanta.

Once the longest of long-shot hopefuls, he's now firmly in the top tier of candidates, thanks to a recent surge in polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that kick off the nominating calendar.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, expects Buttigieg “to be one of the big storylines” coming out of the debate.

“In every single debate so far, the person who came in as the front-runner or with momentum has faced serious incoming,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

“In each one of them, the person in the crosshairs stumbled,” he emphasized. “And so the question for Buttigieg is, now that he’s that guy, how does he handle the incoming?”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

The 37-year-old candidate is the youngest in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls – and Tran spotlighted the “generational contrast” between Buttigieg and the other top-tier contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are all in their 70’s.

“Look to the upcoming debate to see the top tier of candidates try to turn his youth and fresh take into a vulnerability,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The debate also comes as Buttigieg faces increased media attention for his lack of support in polling among black voters, who make up around 20 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate.

The debate’s being held in Georgia's largest city and capital – which is home to a large and vibrant African-American community. Elleithee said Buttigieg “has got to begin show soon that he can get some traction with black voters and this is a good opportunity for him to do that.”

“He would do himself a lot of good to come out tonight and find some way to connect with black voters in a real way,” he suggested.

Tran looked to the candidate’s numerous policy proposals, saying that Buttigieg’s “newly minted status at the top of the polls in Iowa also offers an opportunity for the mayor to discuss his expansive ideas about how to govern the nation.”

Buttigieg likely won’t be the only candidate with a mark on his or her back.

“I suspect that Warren’s going to be the other main target of attacks tonight,” Elleithee predicted. “Her Medicare-for-all plan has proven to be a major target. So she’s going to continue to be pushed on it. In the last debate, she was pushed on it. She stumbled. She then came out with details and now those details are going to be fair game.”

Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were the two candidates who took on Warren over her government-run single-payer health care proposal at last month’s debate.

And Elleithee said “if there’s going to be any real fireworks tonight, I think the thing to look for will be Buttigieg versus Warren on this issue. They have both emerged as sort of the standard-bearers of the two sides of the Medicare-for-all debate, that has sort of become a proxy issue for this bigger discussion about the direction of the Democratic Party. “

But Tran said Warren should be able to take the heat.

“I expect Senator Warren will continue to take swings from others on stage around the costs of her health care proposal — but if the previous debate matchups are any indicator of how she will respond, I don’t see her being ruffled by the attention,” she predicated.

As he has at every debate to date, Biden will also be in the spotlight. Although he’ll likely not face the scrutiny he weathered in the first three debates – when he was the unrivaled front-runner – Elleithee stressed that “Biden’s going to need to have a good night. He’s still in good shape but he’s slipped a bit in the early states. He’s got to stop the slide.”

And Tran noted that “as before, voters will have their eyes on Vice President Joe Biden to see how he manages questions about his experience — the good and the bad — and his reaction to the impeachment hearings currently underway.”

Tran also highlighted that she’s going to “be on the lookout” on whether Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang have breakout moments.

“Both have delivered strong performances in the past rounds of debates, albeit without surging in the polls as a result. But they both bring unique perspectives to the stage and it’s not too late to shift the dynamics heading into Iowa,” she explained.

Elleithee’s got his eye on Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a one-time top tier contender who’s seen her White House bid plummet this autumn.

“She’s got to see if she can claw her way back in,” he said.

And he pointed to Klobuchar, “who keeps having steady debate performances that haven’t translated into significant support in the polls. She’s inched up a little bit.

My Ferrari has been in my garage this whole time. In fact, I just drove it here myself, and it’s parked right behind me.”

Trump-hating Democrats would ignore this development. Trump-loathing journalists would cover it up. And the impeachment fires would blaze away, undeterred, while the left tarred Trump as “America’s car thief in chief.”

This scenario mirrors Ukrainegate: The Ukrainians – whom Trump supposedly pressured, quid-pro-quoed, bribed, or extorted – repeatedly insist that nothing nefarious ever happened.

TRUMP SLAMS PELOSI AS 'GROSSLY INCOMPETENT' FOR TRADE DEAL HANDLING, CALLS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY A 'KANGAROO COURT'

Asked about these numerous denials, former federal prosecutor Doug Burns said Thursday morning on “Fox & Friends”: “The victim wasn’t victimized.”

Consider these pleas from Ukrainians that they never felt abused by Trump and any supposed strings between $391 million in military aid that was temporarily withheld and demands that they investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their ties to the Burisma natural gas company (on whose board Hunter reportedly was paid $50,000 per month to serve) and Kiev’s earlier probes of Burisma.

Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed all of this in a July 25 phone call, around which Ukrainegate revolves.

Consider the following statements:

“I know what the conversation was about, and I think there was no pressure,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told the Hromadske news outlet Sept. 21. “This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.”

“Nobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent state,” Zelensky told Russia’s Rossiya 24 news channel Sept. 25 at the United Nations General Assembly. “The only one person by the way who can put pressure on me ... is my son, who is 6 years old.”

“Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky told journalists at a joint appearance that afternoon with Trump at the U.N.

“I’m telling you – no, there was no such connection,” between military aid and investigations, a senior Ukrainian official told Time magazine Sept. 25.

“I was never pressured and there were no conditions being imposed” on military assistance or a meeting between Zelensky and Trump, Ukraine’s president told Kyodo News Oct. 5.

“There was no pressure or blackmail from the U.S.,” Zelensky said in Kiev during an Oct. 10 “press marathon” with some 300 journalists who took turns interviewing him in small groups. “This call influenced only one thing. We needed to secure a meeting, that it was necessary to meet with the president,” he said. “I wanted to show him our team, our young team. I wanted to get him into Ukraine.”

“I had no idea the military aid was held up” at the time of the call with Trump, Zelensky said Oct. 10. Much like making a bomb threat while staying silent about the explosive device, it would have been tough for Trump to bribe or extort Zelensky without informing him that this security relief had been paused to ascertain whether Zelensky would keep his anti-corruption campaign promises. Kiev learned about this delay in late August. Zelensky and Vice President Mike Pence discussed this in Warsaw on Sept. 1. The assistance was released 10 days later.

“And after this meeting, the U.S. unlocked the aid and added $140 million,” Zelensky said. “That’s why there was no blackmail.”

“I’m against corruption,” Zelensky told ABC News’ Tom Llamas Oct. 10. “This is not corruption, it was just a call.” Zelensky also said: “This has nothing to do with weapons and the Burisma situation.” He added: “There was no blackmail. It was not the subject of our conversation.”

“There was no blackmail,” Zelensky said Oct. 10. “We are not servants. We are an independent country.”

“Our calls were not linked to Burisma or military aid,” Zelensky also said on Oct. 10.

“Ambassador Sondland did not tell us, and certainly did not tell me, about a connection between the assistance and the investigations,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said Nov. 14 about Gordon Sondland, America’s emissary to the European Union. “I have never seen a direct relationship between investigations and security assistance,” Prystaiko said, according to Interfax Ukraine. “Yes, the investigations were mentioned, you know, in the conversation of the presidents. But there was no clear connection between these events.”

She is both a genuine heroine and an example of how our system is failing us.

Ambassador Yovanovitch sat tall before the committee last week, looking directly at those who were questioning her as she answered them without hesitation. No matter how she was attacked, how her service for our country was minimized by some (including by President Trump in a tweet), she remained unruffled.

In a soft and steady voice, Yovanovitch focused on the facts. No one on the committee, try as they might, could get her to take a cheap shot or make an unkind remark.

LEGAL ANALYSTS REACT TO MARIE YOVANOVITCH'S TESTIMONY, AGREE DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A LEG TO STAND ON

I could see when she was shocked or upset only when she raised one carefully groomed eyebrow. That was it! As someone who has been known to hit back pretty hard, I was in awe of her cool in the face of so much heat being thrown in her direction.

As Yovanovitch spoke and told her story, the whole world saw a good person and a thorough professional – someone humble, smart, dedicated and firm in her values.

Her story is an immigrant’s American Dream. Her parents fled communist Russia to Canada, where she was born. When she was just a toddler, they moved to the United States.

Right out of Princeton, Yovanovitch was hired by the U.S. State Department and has served honorably under six administrations – four Republican and two Democratic. She moved steadily up the hierarchy at the department and won awards in many of the places she served.

People often think of serving in an embassy is a non-stop party, constantly hosting leaders, business executives and civic groups to advance our national interest and demonstrate the joy of the American way of life. Yovanovitch was not always in a post where it was wise to party.

How Yovanovitch was treated showed how easily corrupt people can undermine our nonpartisan Foreign Service by convincing career politicians to spread disinformation about an ambassador.

In the 33 years she served, Yovanovitch moved 13 times – including five times to hardship posts like Somalia, the world’s “most failed state” by some estimations, a place riddled with corruption and torn by civil war.

She served in Russia during an attempted coup where she was literally caught in the crossfire. She needed to get to the embassy while there was gunfire in the streets. She had to try three times to get to her car, dodging bullets without the benefit of body armor or even a helmet.

That was the steel I saw in her spine as I watched her testify. Yovanovitch’s posture is that of a woman who has faced down bullets to live her values.

As she said about her parents in her opening testimony: “Their personal history – my personal history – gave me both great gratitude to the United States and great empathy for others – like the Ukrainian people – who want to be free.”

It was her commitment to keep her oath to support and defend the Constitution that got Yovanovitch removed as our ambassador to Ukraine – ordered back to the U.S. suddenly despite her outstanding performance as ambassador.

Yovanovitch was America’s “point person” for fighting corruption in Ukraine, mostly pressuring prosecutors who refused to prosecute. In the course of doing this, she angered people deeply involved in corrupt activities, especially in the energy industry.

When she saw President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, former Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland trying to pull off their caper for President Trump, Yovanovitch knew where to draw the line.

It is one thing to use the resources of the United States to advance our stated policy to fight corruption in Ukraine. It’s another thing altogether to use those same resources, as I believe Trump did, to bribe a foreign president to smear a political rival – former Vice President Joe Biden.

As Yovanovitch testified, I imagined her first meeting with Giuliani appearing in front of her desk, thinking he’d just brush this dame aside and go about his business. What he saw looking back at him was what we all saw when she testified.

Giuliani didn’t even try to outmaneuver her. He knew he had to get her removed from her post. Yovanovitch had just agreed to extend her tour until 2020 when Giuliani started his smear campaign, and it succeeded quickly. Yovanovitch got yanked out of Ukraine – told to take the next plane out of the country.

How Yovanovitch was treated showed how easily corrupt people can undermine our nonpartisan Foreign Service by convincing career politicians to spread disinformation about an ambassador.

Why didn’t the State Department stick up for her, clearly one of our best? The shameful circumstances of her departure justify the question Yovanovitch asked during her testimony: “How could our system fail like this?”

Ambassador Yovanovitch, I hope in the end that the system does not fail. If it has failed you, it has failed all of us, and we must work to rebuild it as soon as we can.

People sometimes talk about the American Experiment and I can see that. Two hundred plus years and we’re still trying to figure things out. And others describe it as the American Dream.

The American Dream is founded on shared values like that Marie Yovanovitch embodies: honesty, fairness and liberty. If I’m having my American Dream, people like Marie Yovanovitch are lighting it up, contributing to building a system that rarely fails.

On the roster: Sondland bursts the ‘perfect’ bubble - Time Out: Nineteen Thanksgivings ‘over there’ - Buttigieg takes the lead in New Hampshire - Opossum like its hot



SONDLAND BURSTS THE ‘PERFECT’ BUBBLE

President Trump’s ambassador to the European Union didn’t tell us anything today that wasn’t obvious from the moment America first read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.



Gordon Sondland certainly added some context with his descriptions of the Keystone Cops routine by Rudy Giuliani. Sondland also made clear what some had once adamantly denied: That help for Ukraine was contingent on the president’s political demands.



But anybody who didn’t think those things were true after reading Trump’s transcript was either being facile or is a few chicken wings short of a dozen.



Democrats can be happy to have had such a senior official from the Trump administration – a political appointee of the president himself – make their case so clearly.



But there is reason for relief among Republicans, too.



The House GOP has been a messaging disaster throughout this process. It’s not entirely their fault given the contradictory, scattershot efforts from the White House, but it has not been pretty at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.



Democrats with uncharacteristic discipline have homed in on the concept of the president abusing his broad foreign policy powers to try to harm his leading political rival.



Seemingly on a daily rotating basis, the president’s defenders in Congress have tried out myriad defenses. He didn’t do it! If he did do it, everyone else does it! The process is unfair! Trump was just worried about corruption!



The worst version of this stuff has been the tortured explanations about the “bigger” story in Ukraine. As Democrats tell their simpler story about presidential misconduct, some Republicans have been trying to tell a more convoluted one about the real nature of Ukrainian politics.



Sondland’s testimony today should put that all to rest, and that is good news for the GOP.



As we have long argued here, Republicans should be following the playbook laid out in 1998 by Bill Clinton and his team.



Much as with Clinton’s seamy conduct with a White House intern, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of what Trump did to the Ukrainian president. Poll after poll shows that two-thirds or more of voters think the president acted wrongly.



But on the question of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, voters are much more evenly divided. That difference points the way to the useful strategy going forward and a way for the White House to meaningfully diminish support for impeachment.



There’s no sense in trying to convince persuadable voters that what Trump did was “perfect.” That’s a fool’s errand. But arguing that the offense doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment, especially less than a year away from an election, is a political winner.



Acknowledging Trump’s mistake, reminding voters that the system worked – the necessary aid to fight Russia’s military advances in Ukraine did flow to Kyiv – and pointing to next November seems like a much more fruitful place for the GOP to be.



If that approach is consistently applied it could make Democrats look like they are obsessed with obvious, old issues rather than dealing with the matters important to voters.



But that will require Republicans, including the president, to abandon their doctrine of denial and excuse. Sondland made doing so much easier today.



THE RULEBOOK: BIG BOSS MAN

“The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength; and the power of directing and employing the common strength, forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 74



TIME OUT: NINETEEN THANKSGIVINGS ‘OVER THERE’

NYT: “This year marks the 19th Thanksgiving since the beginning of the wars, occupations, operations and deployments that together form what the Pentagon calls the global war on terrorism. Across all this time and terrain, a few million American service members, and those who labored beside them, have accumulated vast and varied observances of a quintessential American holiday spent at war. Earlier this year The Times asked service members, veterans and civilians who have celebrated Thanksgiving in a conflict zone to share their photographs and memories. … Like combat service itself, Thanksgivings for troops have been wildly uneven experiences. Depending on each place and time, dinners and celebrations veered between scarcity and excess, spectacle and sorrow, isolation and crowds. But common themes inform veteran memories, including the longing for home caused by separation from families and lifelong rituals, the bonds many veterans formed with fellow troops, and recollections of rich palettes of emotions associated with the particular circumstances troops lived in while deployed.”

BUTTIGIEG TAKES THE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

WMUR9: “The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll of 255 likely Democratic primary voters shows that [Pete] Buttigieg, supported by 25 percent, now holds a 10 percentage point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are tied for second at 15 percent. Buttigieg is substantially ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is in fourth place at 9 percent. Rounding out the top 10 were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 6 percent; billionaire activist Tom Steyer of California at 5 percent; U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 3 percent each; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York at 2 percent and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 1 percent. Thirteen percent of those polled said they were undecided.”



Can he bring the momentum to the debate stage? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. … But that surge in the early states comes with the glare of additional scrutiny, including on his struggles appealing to African American voters in other states, and the growing likelihood of attacks from Democratic opponents eager to blunt Buttigieg’s rise and regain momentum of their own. … Though the campaign has heated up recently, many candidates are still reluctant to go on the attack and risk alienating a rival’s supporters. But Buttigieg’s strong polling out of Iowa has already come with fresh criticism over several campaign missteps related to one of the mayor’s biggest weaknesses: his lack of support among African American voters, which has contributed to his lower numbers in polls of Democrats in South Carolina and nationally.”



Michael Kruse: Are your neighbors ready for Mayor Pete? - Politico: “Up till now, Buttigieg’s youth and sexual orientation largely have been calling cards in the Democratic primary, distinguishing him in a field whose front-runners are in their 70s and whose back-of-the-packers are too numerous for most people to keep track of. … When it comes to the prospect of a gay president, the numbers right now are sobering for Buttigieg: Polling suggests that the country was more ready for a black president back in 2008 than it is for a gay president now. And last month, the current iteration of the question of readiness became front-page news when a leaked memo revealed focus groups commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested his sexuality could be ‘a barrier’ for black voters in at least South Carolina, the crucial fourth nominating contest—and a bellwether for the party’s more socially conservative voters.”



Biden steps up efforts in Iowa - WaPo: “[Biden] has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals. And now, even as he retains a national lead in polling, he is falling behind in a state that doomed his campaign the last time he sought the presidency. Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”



Foundering Harris calls talk of campaign crack-up ‘gossip’ - Nevada Independent: “California Sen. Kamala Harris is dismissing recent reports of unrest within her campaign and chatter among attendees of a Democratic convention in her home state about whether she should drop out of the presidential race as no more than ‘gossip.’ … With about two and a half months until the first presidential preferences are cast, Harris said that it is “still early” and that “to follow the punditry around what is going on with the campaign is to overlook what’s happening on the street…” But she remained vague when asked whether that enthusiasm had at all changed her campaign’s plans to shift staff from Nevada to Iowa. ‘I will keep you posted but I’m going to tell you something: Nevada is very, very important to me,’ Harris said.”



Adieu, Wayne Messam - Axios: “Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam (D-Fla.) announced on Wednesday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. The big picture: Messam got into the race after Southbend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's announcement, however, the small-town Florida mayor failed to gain the momentum that Buttigieg's campaign achieved. Messam did not make it on to any debate stage and struggled to see significant gains in polling. Messam is Miramar's first black mayor, the owner of a construction company, a former college football player and the son of a Jamaican sugarcane worker.”

“What do you make of the Chairman’s larger than anyone else’s chair? It looks like Queen Elizabeth’s throne to me. Is that standard for the Congress? To me, it makes him look diminutive.” – Tom Winter Lt. Col. USMC (Ret), Steele, Mo.

“So, it would seem that the Democratic Party fear a journalist [Tim Alberta] that is not necessarily in the tank for the Democratic agenda. What a load of disservice to the voters! Our country is greatly endangered by partisan politics and journalism that does not stay clear of taking sides. Perhaps, I am not in the swing of things, but I would like to believe that the American voter could figure out what to do or think without a partisan scorecard. That is probably naive.” – Lisa Lentz, Hollister, Calif.



[Ed. note: Both sides suffer from this affliction. In 2016, Republicans were talking openly about only allowing avowed partisans or right-leaning opinion mongers to moderate debates. It was nearly as pitiful as the effort to assassinate the character of Alberta, one the most respected, finest political reporters working in Washington today because he started his career at a right-leaning publication. I dare anyone to find any partisan hackery in Alberta’s work, wherever he was doing it. But both Republicans and Democrats make a self-defeating mistake when they look for gentle coddling instead of incisive questioning. Are Democrats better off for letting opinion journalists play patty-cake with their candidates these many months? No chance. Insulating candidates from tough questioning has not only help keep the field at its bloated size but also allowed them to ignore the most important issues when it comes to winning in 2020. It’s farcical that Elizabeth Warren made it until October before anyone put the bite on her about her formless, pie-in-the-sky health insurance program. If you can’t handle Tim Alberta for five questions, you darned sure can’t handle the presidency.]

OPOSSUM LIKE ITS HOT

AP: “A movement is growing in North Carolina to prevent the act of so-called ‘opossum dropping.’ The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year’s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group says it’s continuing its legislative efforts.”

Potentially problematic figure for Democrats set to testify as key Trump impeachment witnesses undercut claims of 'quid pro quo,' 'bribery' and 'cover-up'

Republicans sounded a celebratory note as House Democrats' impeachment inquiry wrapped up another day of public hearings Tuesday evening, saying the day's witnesses had served only to highlight fundamental problems in the case against President Trump.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking Morrison and Volker about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When asked whether there were indications of quid pro quo, bribery or extortion, they each repeatedly answered, ""No.""

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats in the second week of public hearings in their impeachment inquiry. With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years. Click here for a complete summary of Tuesday's testimony.

A 'Gordon Problem' for Democrats: Democrats' troubles with their case against Trump may continue Wednesday with Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union and perhaps impeachment inquiry's most anticipated witness. Sondland repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Sondland, critics argue, has a credibility problem.

In a closed-door hearing, Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement. Democrats quickly hailed the revelation as proof that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden's family business dealings in the country in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid. However, in prior testimony, Sondland said he had texted Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, that in September saying there was no quid pro quo. Click here for a complete preview of Wednesday's testimony.

Democrats to hold fifth presidential primary debate

The Democratic Party will hold its fifth presidential primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night and it will likely be overshadowed by the Trump impeach inquiry hearing. The following 10 candidates qualified to be on stage for Wednesday's debate: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang.

Wednesday's debate comes amid uncertainty over whether Democrats truly have a candidate who could defeat President Trump next November as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has seriously flirted with the idea of entering the race and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared his candidacy last week. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg may find himself under attack Wednesday night as he has surged in recent polls in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February.

Acquitted Navy SEAL faces review, potential loss of Trident pin, senior US defense official says

The top admiral in the Navy plans to announce a review in which peers will determine whether to remove SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident pin following his highly publicized war crimes case, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Tuesday. The Trident is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, the source told Fox News.

Commander Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the Navy, told Fox News that the chief of naval operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, supported Rear Adm. Collin Green's decision to uphold a mitigated sentence against Gallagher, who was acquitted in July of killing an Islamic State fighter in Iraq. A San Diego jury sentenced Gallagher to a reduced rank and four months of confinement, which he has already served, for posing with the body of the dead ISIS fighter, which was considered the least egregious of the seven charges he was facing. President Trump signed an order last Friday reversing the sentence and ordering the promotion of Gallagher back to the rank he held before his trial.

Better yet, let’s call it a riddle. When is a “quid pro quo” not a “quid pro quo?” The answer is … when it’s “presumed.”

U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that there was a “quid pro quo” between the U.S. and Ukraine, even though President Trump made it crystal clear to Sondland that there was no “quid pro quo.”

So, how did the ambassador arrive at his opinion that a “quid pro quo” must somehow exist? It turns out that he assumed or “presumed” it. At one point, he called it a mere “guess.”

SONDLAND IMPLICATES TOP OFFICIALS ON UKRAINE, BUT SAYS HE ‘NEVER HEARD’ QUID PRO QUO FROM TRUMP

The trouble with presumptions and guess-work is that they are often unreliable and sometimes quite wrong. Assumptions and suppositions, by their nature, can be risky and foolish. We should trust only in what we know that is derived from facts. This was the fatal flaw in Sondland’s narrative.

Here is what we actually know: Nowhere in the July 25 telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is there evidence of a demand, threat, condition or pressure for a “quid pro quo.” None. That is a demonstrable fact, as proven by a transcript of the conversation that the White House released to the public. Read it for yourself.

TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT

There is no mention of military aid in exchange for an investigation into either election meddling by Ukraine in 2016 or a potential corrupt act by former Vice President Joe Biden. Indeed, the U.S. financial assistance was delivered to Kiev and there was no investigation launched.

We also know that President Trump personally informed Sondland: “I want nothing, I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.”

The ambassador confirmed this exculpatory statement Wednesday. It was nearly identical to what he said in his earlier deposition when he testified that the president told him: “I want nothing. I don’t want to give them anything and I don’t want anything from them.” Sondland then elaborated by stating: “He (President Trump) kept repeating no quid pro quo over and over again.”

Yet, throughout his testimony Sondland seemed to oscillate wildly from contradiction to confusion to vacillation. He conspicuously omitted from his lengthy opening statement what proved to be the most stunning revelation of all. He told the committee: “I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement” of investigations.

Here is the important exchange:

Question: Did the president ever tell you personally about any preconditions for anything?

Sondland: No.

Question: OK. So, the president never told you about any preconditions for the aid to be released?

Sondland: No.

The counsel for Republicans seemed dumbfounded that the ambassador would bury the lead. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, was more direct. He mockingly suggested that Sondland’s omission was a deliberate attempt to hide direct evidence that exonerates the president, while emphasizing Sondland’s presumptive illusion of wrongdoing.

Despite the president’s repeated denial of a “quid pro quo,” how did Sondland reach a contrary conclusion? Sondland surmised it.

While other witnesses have relied on a gossip chain of hearsay and conjecture, the ambassador appears to have invested himself in little more than a hunch. This, of course, was warmly embraced by the mainstream media mob. Consider the devastating cross-examination by Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio:

Question: If you pull up CNN today, right now, their banner says “Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid.” Is that your testimony today, Ambassador Sondland? Because I don’t think you’re saying that.

Sondland: I’ve said repeatedly, congressman, I was presuming.

Question: So no one heard. Not just the president. Giuliani didn’t tell you. Mulvaney didn’t tell you. Nobody. Pompeo didn’t tell you. Nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct?

Sondland: I think I already testified.

Question: No, answer the question. No one on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying this aid to the investigation? Because if your answer is yes, then the chairman is wrong. And the headline on CNN is wrong. No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations. Yes or no?

Sondland: Yes.

Question: So you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations.

Sondland: Other than my own presumption.

Throughout four days of tortured hearings, Americans have been force-fed the gruel of speculation, interpretation, opinion, multiple hearsay, and now “presumptions.”

This is impeachment by rumor and innuendo. And that is no presumption.

One of the key witnesses in the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry against Trump, Sondland claimed he kept Secretary of State Mike Pompeo aware of what was going on and said he specifically told Vice President Pence he ""had concerns"" the military aid to Ukraine ""had become tied"" to investigations -- though a Pence aide denied it. And he repeatedly lambasted Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s leading role in the administration’s Ukraine dealings.

""Everyone was in the loop,"" Sondland testified. ""It was no secret.""

READ: GORDON SONDLAND'S IMPEACHMENT HEARING OPENING STATEMENT

Still, in comments seized upon by Republicans, Sondland testified: “I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement"" of investigations. He said he never personally heard Trump discuss preconditions. And at one point, he confirmed Trump told him, ""I want nothing.""

Taken in their entirety, Sondland's statements Wednesday are likely to fuel the narratives of both parties. He was seen as a wild card going into the hearing, given he has offered testimony that conflicted with others' and recently amended his statements to acknowledge he did talk to Ukraine about investigations after initially indicating otherwise.

The impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower’s complaint about Trump's July 25 call when he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for political investigations – including involving former Vice President Joe Biden's family -- at the same time U.S. military aid for the ally was stalled.

Sondland made clear Wednesday he merely presumed the aid was linked to investigations, at one point referring to this as a ""guess.""

But he suggested he had his reasons, agreeing that the conclusion was like ""two plus two equals four."" He stressed he never got a clear answer on why the aid was held up, saying in the absence of an explanation he came to believe that the aid and the investigations were linked.

“I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson,” Sondland said at one point, referring to the Republican senator involved in Ukraine policy. “And I also shared my concerns with the Ukrainians.”

Further, his testimony name-dropped a slew of other top Trump officials, which is likely to pique Democrats' interest.

Sondland, throughout the inquiry, has been portrayed as a key player in an irregular channel of diplomacy led by Giuliani. On Wednesday, Sondland repeatedly expressed his displeasure with Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine policy but said they were working with him at Trump's direction. He also claimed the “suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false.”

“We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani,” Sondland said, explaining he believed State Department officials should take the responsibility for Ukraine matters. “Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.”

While couching his language regarding the aid hold-up, Sondland was more explicit when it came to the link between investigations and a White House meeting and call between Trump and Zelensky. He bluntly described Giuliani's requests linking the two as a quid pro quo.

He told the committee: “I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo? ... As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.”

Sondland also said he and other officials “disagreed with the need to involve” Giuliani but they “did not believe that his role was improper at the time.” He said that ""as a presidential appointee, I followed the directions of the president.”

“If I had known of all of Mr. Giuliani’s dealings or of his associations with individuals now under criminal indictment, I would not have acquiesced to his participation,” Sondland said. “Still, given what we knew at the time, what we were asked to do did not appear to be wrong.”

Giuliani on Wednesday pushed back against Sondland’s testimony, tweeting he “came into this” at the request of then-Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker. “Sondland is speculating based on VERY little contact,"" Giuliani tweeted. ""I never met him and had very few calls with him, mostly with Volker.""

Meanwhile, Sondland described a Sept. 1 meeting between Zelensky and Pence in Warsaw. “I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations,” Sondland said.

But on Wednesday, Pence’s office flatly denied the accusation, saying, “This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened.”

He also repeatedly connected the secretary of state to the Ukraine efforts.

Sondland testified that Pompeo, as late as Sept. 24, was telling Volker to speak with Giuliani. He said Volker sent him a WhatsApp message that said, “Spoke w Rudy per guidance from S.” Sondland said “S” was in reference to the secretary of state.

He also described another conversation on Sept. 1 in Warsaw with Zelenksy’s senior aide, Andriy Yermak, saying he expressed concerns that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement about investigations. “Based on my communications with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. Yermak,” he said.

State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus later denied that the secretary of state talked with Sondland about the aid link: ""Gordon [Sondland] never told Secretary Pompeo that he believed the president was linking aid to investigations of political opponents. Any suggestion to the contrary is flat out false.”

On Wednesday, Sondland said he was not on the July call and didn’t read a transcript until it was publicly released in September. He called it “very odd” that he never received a detailed read-out of the call with the Biden references. Sondland also repeatedly made clear he did not support preconditions on the aid.

“We had no desire to set any conditions on the Ukrainians,” Sondland said. “Indeed, my personal view -- which I shared repeatedly with others -- was that the White House meeting and security assistance should have proceeded without pre-conditions of any kind.”

Sondland on Wednesday said his goal, at the time, was to do what was necessary to get the aid released. Asked if it's true he told Trump at one point that Zelensky ""loves your ass,"" the diplomat replied ""sounds like something I would say"" to laughter in the hearing room.

Republicans dismissed the proceedings as they have done during previous sessions. California Rep. Devin Nunes, the GOP’s top member on the committee, told the witness: ""Ambassador Sondland, you are here today to be smeared.”

Nunes also reiterated calls for the committee to subpoena Hunter Biden, the whistleblower who wrote the complaint against Trump and Democratic National Committee documents – something Democrats have not granted.

VINDMAN ACCUSES TRUMP OF MAKING IMPROPER UKRAINE ‘DEMAND,’ SAYS HE ALERTED INTEL OFFICIAL

Republicans on the committee also defended Trump by emphasizing how Ukraine got what they wanted without ever announcing an investigation. “They didn’t have to do anything,” Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan said, adding “they get the call, they get the meeting, they get the money.""

Jordan accused Sondland of getting all three of those ""wrong"": “It’s not two plus two, it’s 0 for 3.”

Sondland later expressed frustration when a Democratic congressman, Sean Maloney on New York, repeatedly tried to get him to say Trump would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens. He eventually said, ""I assume President Trump would benefit.""

The diplomat added: “I’ve been really forthright, and I really resent what you’re trying to do.”

Maloney mocked Sondland for having to previously amend his testimony. “We appreciate your candor, but let’s be clear what it took to get it out of you,” he said.

Meanwhile, the top committee Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, in his opening remarks accused Trump and Pompeo of making ""such a concerted and across-the-board effort to obstruct this investigation and this impeachment inquiry."" Schiff added, ""They do so at their own peril.""

Sondland's appearance at Wednesday morning's hearing, and his closeness to Trump, is of particular concern to the White House as the historic impeachment inquiry reaches closer to the president, pushing through an intense week with nine witnesses testifying over three days in back-to-back sessions. But Trump, talking to reporters outside the White House on Wednesday, referenced Sondland's comments that he wanted nothing from Ukraine and argued, “That means it’s all over.”

Among the details that other witnesses have filled in are those concerning a call he placed to Trump from a busy Kiev restaurant the day after the president prodded Ukraine's leader to investigate the Bidens. After another diplomat witness revealed this, Sondland confirmed Wednesday they had the call -- saying Sondland doesn't remember much of it but has no reason to doubt other accounts, which said the conversation dealt with the topic of investigations.

Sondland, who has had to amend his testimony related to his conversations with Ukraine, told lawmakers he has had hundreds of meetings and calls with individuals in his role but is not a note-taker. He said he has requested documents from the State Department and the White House for documents phone records to help refresh his memory. “In the absence of these materials, my memory has not been perfect,” he said.

Sondland's appearance follows the testimony Tuesday of four national security and diplomatic officials, including Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a career Army officer, who described Trump's call with Zelenskiy as ""improper."" Also testifying later Wednesday are Pentagon official Laura Cooper and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale.

MORRISON, VOLKER UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO,' 'BRIBERY' AND 'COVER-UP' IN PIVOTAL DAY OF TESTIMONY

Bereft of facts, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is determined to remove Trump from office based purely on the opinions of others who surmised or imagined that Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden or the U.S. would withhold $391 million in military aid to Kiev. Ukraine never launched such an investigation, and the financial support was delivered.

Anyone can read the transcript, as it is available online. It speaks for itself and is the best evidence that there is no evidence at all of a “quid pro quo.” This was corroborated by the statements of Zelensky, who confirmed that there was no demand, threat, condition or pressure applied by Trump. It was a “normal” conversation, he said.

Indeed, the Ukrainian government never knew that U.S. aid had been temporarily frozen until almost five weeks after the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call. This renders a “quid pro quo” a legal impossibility.

The recipient of the “quid” must, at the very least, be aware of the “quo.” Moreover, two of the testifying witnesses readily conceded that the frozen aid was “consistent with administration policy.” So much for the infamous “quid pro quo.”

No matter. Schiff called four witnesses Tuesday to render their gratuitous opinions that were conjured up from either a remarkable feat of telepathy or borne of prejudice.

Taking center stage was Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a staffer on the National Security Council who listened to the Trump-Zelensky conversation when it occurred. No one should doubt Vindman’s patriotism. He deserves our universal respect and gratitude. It is his judgment, opinion, and actions that are suspect. He is not immune to criticism simply because of his heroic service in uniform.

After scolding Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., a civilian, for not addressing him by his military rank, Vindman testified that he felt “concerned” about Trump’s conversation with Zelensky. This was nothing more than his opinion, impression or feeling. We all have them. They are a poor substitute for facts. “I was making a judgment call as a layman,” Vindman confessed.

The unvarnished truth is that Vindman did not like what Trump said on the phone call because the president did not strictly follow the notes Vindman had prepared for the discussion. In describing the call, Vindman stated: “This was not in the preparation material that I had offered.”

How dare Trump deviate from Vindman’s carefully crafted diplomatic script! So Vindman complained.

Instead of registering his complaint with his direct supervisor, Tim Morrison, Vindman conveyed his feelings to others. Among them was an individual in the intelligence community that Vindman won’t identify, who may be the faux “whistleblower” or source for the “whistleblower,” who then filed a complaint that doesn’t qualify under the whistleblower statute as a valid complaint. This was the conclusion of the Department of Justice in an 11-page opinion.

By his acts, it appears that Vindman was instrumental in initiating the current impeachment insanity. An unelected subordinate employee disagreed with the policy judgment of the president of the United States and sought to create havoc by disseminating (or, if you prefer, leaking) his discordant opinion.

To make matters worse, Vindman contorted the president’s use of the words “do me a favor” by asserting that Trump had made an “inappropriate demand” of Zelensky.

Inasmuch as there is no demand identified in the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky phone call, Vindman elected to impute a demand by arguing that for those who serve in the military, a request or favor for something is always considered a demand.

In other words, Vindman applied a military standard to a president who has never served in the military and has stated unequivocally that he made no demands of Zelensky. The Ukrainian president, who also did not serve in the military, is on record stating that no demand was made of him, as noted earlier. But Vindman, armed with uncommon clairvoyance, somehow knows better.

Perhaps Vindman thought that he was above the president or a super-special expert to which all individuals, including Trump, should defer. The witness was reminded of how he had touted (or exaggerated) his unparalleled credentials and authority during his earlier closed-door deposition:

In his deposition Vindman stated: “I’m the director for Ukraine. I’m responsible for Ukraine. I’m the most knowledgeable. I’m the authority for Ukraine, for the National Security Council and the White House.”

The self-puffery was unbecoming, but it spoke volumes about what may have motivated Vindman when President Trump had the audacity to conduct foreign policy in a way that his NSC staffer did not pre-approve.

Schiff called four witnesses Tuesday to render their gratuitous opinions that were conjured up from either a remarkable feat of telepathy or borne of prejudice.

In reality, just how important was Vindman in the White House hierarchy? He conceded that he has never so much as met the president.

Vindman’s bias and coziness with Ukraine was underscored when he admitted that the foreign government had offered on three separate occasions to make him its defense minister. He rejected the overtures.

But Vindman’s boss, National Security Council official Tim Morrison, had previously called into question Vindman’s judgment, although he refused to elaborate.

Not everyone who listened to the Trump-Zelensky call agreed with Vindman’s opinion that Trump’s call was “improper.” Foreign Service Officer Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, called the conversation “unusual,” but testified that she did not see the need to report the matter.

Morrison was asked if anything concerned him about the call and replied “no.” Former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker testified that he was “never involved in anything I considered to be bribery or quid pro quo.”

Throughout the hearing, Schiff turned himself into a pretzel as he tried to rewrite the law. He shut down any questions to Vindman that might unmask the fake “whistleblower” by asserting erroneously that the unidentified undercover informant “has a statutory right to anonymity.”

Schiff neglected, of course, to cite the specific statute because it does not exist. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) makes no mention of anonymity. There is a narrow provision that grants the inspector general the discretion to disclose the name or not, but it applies to no one else, including Congress. There is no right, guarantee or privilege to anonymity anywhere in any statute.

During the hearing, Schiff adopted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent pivot from the term “quid pro quo” to “bribery,” after Democrats reportedly found through a focus group that it was a more compelling label for Americans to digest.

But the chairman unwittingly destroyed the bribery argument when he confessed that “bribery does involve a quid pro quo.” But wait. If the Ukrainians had no knowledge of the “quid pro quo,” there can be no bribery. This obvious point seemed lost on Schiff, a former prosecutor.

Members of the unelected bureaucracy in our nation’s diplomatic corps are entitled to their moral, ethical and policy differences. But they are not allowed to substitute their own judgments for those of the president and seek to undermine his authority on foreign policy.

A president should only be removed based on an impeachable offense supported by facts, not opinions. Why? Because, as the Athenian philosopher Plato recognized: “Opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance.”

Adam Schiff’s, D-Calif., impeachment carnival enters a new week with a gaggle of hearsay witnesses offering endless speculation and opinion about an imaginary “quid pro quo” of non-corruption corruption.

Like the title of Herman Wouk’s 1965 comedic farce, “Don’t Stop the Carnival,” President Trump may hope that the impeachment idiocy continues in perpetuity. Or at least until we are well into the presidential election season next year. It will all but guarantee his continued residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Schiff, who serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and Grand Poobah of the impeachment circus, is strikingly reminiscent of Wouk’s fictional main character, Norman Paperman. His hapless antics are the stuff of slapstick and buffoonery. If it can go wrong, it will. No one seems to take poor Norman seriously. Except Norman.

BRADLEY BLAKEMAN: DEMS' IMPEACHMENT OPTION — THIS IS THEIR ONLY EXIT STRATEGY

And so it is with Schiff. He is obsessed, strident, self-righteous, and so blindingly dissolute that he cannot seem to recognize the slow-motion collapse of his dream to remove Trump from office. If Americans are paying attention to his hearings, it is for the same reason we tend to watch video of buildings imploding. Or train wrecks. There is something inexplicably compelling about disasters in the making.

There is exactly zero chance that the president will be evicted by the Senate from the Oval Office. Yet, there is near certainty that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her carnival barker, Schiff, will marshal together their partisan forces to impeach Trump. After all, impeachment was preconceived and preordained the moment Trump was elected. All that was required was some pretext. Any excuse, however spurious, would do.

For the longest time, Democrats and the complicit Trump-hating media were convinced that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would deliver them from their imagined evil. They waited eagerly for 22 months, all the while convicting the president in the court of public opinion with phony accusations and unverified stories on an almost daily basis.

Never mind that there was never any credible evidence of a criminal “collusion” conspiracy hatched by Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the bowels of the Kremlin. The Russia “witch hunt” persisted untethered to reality until the very moment Mueller’s report confirmed that it was all a hoax. Democrats and the media were apoplectic with grief and disbelief. They still are.

Since then, the seek-and-destroy Trump cabal has worked sedulously to invent some other ruse or artifice to rid themselves of their political nemesis. The Ukraine “witch hunt” is the inevitable sequel, only twice as preposterous. The allegedly incriminating evidence is no evidence at all.

The Diplomatic Coffee Klatch

Last week, the chattering class of diplomats took center stage in the carnival. Like a vacuous “coffee klatch” at Starbuck’s, they dispensed all manner of rumor and innuendo based on triple and quadruple hearsay – a guy told a guy who confided in me that the original guy “presumed” there was a ""quid pro quo."" That was Wednesday.

By Friday, the mind-numbing absurdity evolved into even more rank speculation as another diplomat, who admitted that she had no first-hand knowledge of the central issue, told her “boo-hoo” story of being fired as ambassador to Ukraine. If she had a serious complaint, she should have taken it to human resources, not a congressional impeachment inquisition. She readily confessed she knew nothing about bribery or “any criminal activity.”

Ranking Republican Devin Nunes, R-Calif., stated the obvious when he observed, “I’m not exactly sure what the ambassador is doing here today.” Good point.

It turns out that Marie Yovanovitch was sent back to Washington a full two months before Trump’s telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the supposed “quid pro quo.” But that did not stop legal counsel for the Democrats from superimposing on the giant video screen the transcript of the call and asking Yovanovitch to offer her interpretation of its contents and what the president intended.

Yovanovitch is typical of the self-important people who inhabit our nation’s foreign service. For example, she testified, “The U.S. relationship with Ukraine is the single most important relationship.”

Seriously? These diplomats have convinced themselves that the universe revolves around them. They delude themselves into believing that they are the ones who dictate foreign policy, not the president.

If Trump dares to do something they don’t like, they seek to undermine him. They are the malignant force that inhabits our government.

This week there are eight more purported “witnesses” who will be riding the Schiff carnival carousel. They, too, will be spinning opinion and conjecture built on multiple hearsay. As witnesses, they are largely superfluous.

The Trump-Zelensky conversation needs no interpretation. With a transcript available for all to read, it speaks for itself. Nowhere is there a demand, threat, condition, or pressure of a “quid pro quo” linking U.S. military aid to an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. This was corroborated by statements issued from Zelensky.

One diplomat, Bill Taylor, did manage to offer something relevant and material when he told the committee that he had three meetings with the Ukrainian president following the phone call and the subject of a “quid pro quo” never came up. This constitutes strong evidence that it never existed to begin with.

Trump’s Tease

Last week, Pelosi challenged Trump to testify at the carnival. Perhaps she thought it might make for a good sound bite.

On Monday, Trump tweeted a reply to “Nervous Nancy” that he might take her up on the offer to testify “about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt.”

The media kicked into immediate overdrive and commenced salivating over the prospect. They fell for the trap. Or joke.

Trump has no intention of lending dignity to an undignified process. He was merely teasing or tweaking Pelosi, as he is wont to do.

But you can probably expect another tweet to follow in which the president will offer to testify if Schiff transforms his inquisition into a forum that respects both fundamental fairness and due process by allowing Republicans to call their own witnesses and permit full cross-examination of Democrat witnesses without being gaveled down.

Trump knows such an offer will be rejected promptly by Schiff. It would ruin the carnival. Republicans would call the faux “whistleblower” to testify, as well as Schiff himself. Their suspected “collusion” in composing the whistleblower complaint (which doesn’t actually qualify as a legitimate complaint under the law) might well implicate Schiff as the driving force who engineered the whole Ukraine hoax as a pretext to impeach Trump. The chairman would never risk being exposed with the truth.

You see, Schiff is a desperate man. It is a measure of his desperation that he read to Yovanovitch a tweet by Trump publicly criticizing her and then all but asked her if she felt intimidated. The answer was predictable.

Schiff then implied the tweet might be grounds for an article of impeachment for “witness intimidation.” Forget the fact that Schiff created the whole incident by informing the witness of the tweet, it still does not meet the “witness intimidation” requirements of a physical threat to a witness, bribing a witness, or coercing a witness to lie. But neither facts nor the law has ever prevented Schiff from inventing a good story.

As Brad Blakeman observed in a recent Fox News Opinion column, “Democrats are already looking for a way out of the impeachment” charade. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, D-N.Y., one of only two Democrats to vote against the current inquiry, lamented that “It is supposed to be bipartisan … it is supposed to be fair.” He and other members of his party know that Schiff’s machinations have demeaned the process.

However, it may be too late to reverse course and pump the breaks on the impeachment merry-go-round. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has told reporters that the Senate will never convict Trump on such flimsy non-evidence, but that a full-blown trial seems inexorable if the House votes to impeach.

Americans have a keen sense of fairness. Increasingly, they are coming to realize that Schiff’s clown show is the antithesis of an unbiased, equitable, and impartial proceeding. The longer it endures the more likely Democrats will suffer a severe political backlash that will, in the end, benefit the incumbent president.

For this reason, Trump may hope that the carnival never stops.

On the roster: What would Buttigieg’s path look like? - As impeachment grinds on, voters dig in - Congress kicks can on spending until Dec. 20 - Audible: Audible, indeed - Three wise guys wanted for questioning



WHAT WOULD BUTTIGIEG’S PATH LOOK LIKE?

FiveThirtyEight: “[If Pete Buttigieg] winds up pulling disproportionately from [Elizabeth Warren], it could make for a more complicated race. A world where Buttigieg wins both Iowa and New Hampshire is one where Warren will have finished second (or worse) in two early states that, on paper, look tailor-made for her. The underwhelming performances could drain her support among two key elements of her base — wonky-but-not-ideological college-educated whites, who could switch to Buttigieg, and devoted progressives, who could switch to [Bernie Sanders]. In fact, the Selzer poll already showed signs that Iowa liberals were leaving Warren for Sanders; if that happens nationwide, the Democratic primary could exit Super Tuesday as a three-way race between [Joe Biden] as the candidate of nonwhite voters, Buttigieg as the candidate of party elites and Sanders as the candidate of the left.”



Dems turn to big donors to blunt Trump’s early cash advantage - WaPo: “Democratic groups financed by wealthy donors have ratcheted up their spending in recent weeks as party operatives have become concerned that President Trump is gaining an insurmountable lead in the money race. By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.”



New debate threshold squeezes also-rans - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates. To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or Washington, D.C. … The new thresholds will put pressure on Democratic candidates outside a top five – Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris – who have routinely polled above 4 percent in approved surveys so far.”



Dems try to manipulate moderators - NBC News: “The Democratic National Committee and the news organization Politico are locked in an argument over the ideological credentials of a proposed moderator for next month's Democratic debate… Politico and PBS are scheduled to co-host the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. At the behest of its publisher, Robert Allbritton, Politico is pushing for Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine… The top PBS journalists under consideration are Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor and Amna Nawaz. Politico’s decision to push for Alberta has rankled officials at the DNC… The reason: Alberta previously wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine, and has spent the bulk of his recent career chronicling the Republican Party. Democratic Party officials say such a journalist is ill-suited to co-moderate a debate meant to better inform Democratic voters about their potential nominees.”



Sanders hits 4 million donations mark - Fox News: “…[When] it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. ‘Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. ‘This is what momentum looks like.’”



Columbia, S.C. mayor backs Bloomberg - AP: “Before he’s officially a presidential candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is picking up a key endorsement in South Carolina. Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he’s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. ‘He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,’ Benjamin said in an interview. ‘I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.’ First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina’s highest-profile black politicians and was among the candidates to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016.”



Dems pleased with field, still open to changing horses - NPR: “On the 2020 presidential contest, 69% of Democrats say they're happy with the field. Less than a quarter say they're not. Three-quarters of Democrats also say they still haven't made up their minds on who to vote for, down only 7 points since July, the last time the question was asked in the survey. The survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most ‘enthusiastic’ to vote for that person. Being a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters. But there were big differences by party. Democrats would be most ‘enthusiastic’ about voting for a woman, someone who is gay or lesbian, or someone under 40. The top three qualities for Republicans, on the other hand: a business executive, a white man or a woman.”



THE RULEBOOK: HOUSE PARTY

“The number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated. Scarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be rendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 55



TIME OUT: SEVEN SCORE AND 16 YEARS AGO

On this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what is probably the finest piece of American political oratory. Speaking for less than three minutes on a sunny fall afternoon in southern Pennsylvania, Lincoln set out the duty of every generation of Americans: “To preserve and prefect the promise of our founding. Those buried at Gettysburg had died in service of that aim. Will we honor their sacrifice by living for it? “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

AS IMPEACHMENT GRINDS ON, VOTERS DIG IN

NPR: “The country is witnessing one of only a handful of times in its history that Congress has gone through with public hearings on whether to impeach a president. And yet, the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Half of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry — about the same as the poll found last month. Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But 65% of Americans say they can't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment. And 30% say yes, it's possible. … ‘We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive,’ Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said of the impeachment inquiry. ‘What we're seeing is people just locking in.’”



Army colonel testifies about Trump demand - Fox News: “One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans. Vindman acknowledged speaking with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official… Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ‘demand’ and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it ‘would be interpreted as a partisan play.’ He also emphasized that he reported his concerns ‘out of a sense of duty.’ Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been ‘excluded’ from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position.”



Impeachment scrambles Senate strategies - Politico: “The Senate is increasingly likely to hold Trump’s trial in January, according to senators and aides, a reflection of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s uncertain timeline in the House and the dismal prospects for finishing an impeachment trial in December. And pushing the trial into 2020 will bring uncertain fallout for both parties, heightening the intrigue of what will already be historic proceedings on the second floor of the Capitol. … Meanwhile, Republican senators will be in the opening of their own primary season for their reelection campaigns, in which special attention will be placed on their fealty to Trump and any whiff of independence during the trial. … Much is uncertain and out of the Senate’s direct control. No one drew up an impeachment inquiry with plans for a Senate trial in January 2020, and there’s no blueprint from past trials to draw from considering none happened in the heat of a campaign.”



CONGRESS KICKS CAN ON SPENDING UNTIL DEC. 20

Politico: “House and Senate leaders secured a deal on Monday afternoon that would extend government funding for four more weeks and sidestep a debilitating government-wide shutdown. The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature. The current stopgap expires Thursday night. The bill would fund a 3.1 percent military pay raise, it would provide extra cash to help the Commerce Department gear up for the 2020 census and it would allow state highway programs to avoid a $7.6 billion cut this summer. It also includes a number of health extenders and renews three expiring surveillance provisions through March. House Democrats, however, did not secure funding for historically black colleges and universities, an item among their requested policy riders.”



Pelosi hopes Trumka can calm freshmen’s jitters - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies are working to ease long-simmering anxiety among battleground freshmen, which has intensified amid fears that impeachment could creep into 2020 and make many of them one-term members. Pelosi will bring in AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday to speak with freshman Democrats, many of whom have been privately demanding quicker action on President Donald Trump’s trade deal, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting. The private huddle with the labor leader — at a make-or-break moment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — is an attempt to calm concerns of swing-district Democrats who fear their agenda isn’t breaking through with the public and are increasingly frustrated by policy stalemates in Washington.”

AUDIBLE: AUDIBLE, INDEED

“TOTAL EXONERATION!” – Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif, tweeted after an interview Monday on MSNBC’s “Hardball,” in response to what sounded like him expelling a thunderous toot while on air. The official ‘Hardball’ Twitter account clarified the noise was from someone dragging a coffee mug across a table in the studio.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Your snippet from The Atlantic article on The Crown concerning the Queen’s clothing refers to its being, along with her gender, ‘intrinsic to the way she governs.’ No British monarch has governed in well over a hundred years. As the series demonstrates in occasionally painful detail, there are two parts of the British constitution — the efficient and the dignified, represented respectively by the government and the monarch. The monarch functions primarily as the Head of State, a ceremonial position representing the nation’s stability, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, subject to the whims of the democratic electorate. In the U.S. both functions are performed by the President, while in parliamentary democracies like India, Austria, Germany, and Israel the President is the ceremonial Head of State.” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: First, Mr. Foys, let’s be clear that this is all Brianna’s fault… I kid, I kid! First, you are quite right about the distribution of duties in a constitutional monarchy. But second, I think we might be a little forgiving when it comes to the political word choices of fashion writers. I’m sure I’d make a terrible hash of clothing terminology if I was delving into the subject to make a political point. I’m more than happy to give the piece’s author, Sophie Gilbert, plenty of leeway in her genuinely interesting, thoughtful piece.]

THREE WISE GUYS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

KWCH/AP: “Goddard [Kan.] police say the owners of a camel, cow and donkey found wandering the streets of the Wichita suburb have been located. They say the animals, which looked reminiscent of a ‘nativity scene getaway,’ as some called it, belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. A neighborhood in Goddard had three unusual visitors strolling through its streets on Sunday afternoon. … ‘Well we were just coming back from picking up a friend and came into the trailer park and the first thing we see is hey there's a cow, wait a minute, that’s a donkey, and that’s a camel and we had all three,’ said Trudy Wilcox. It was quite the sight, a cow, a donkey, and a camel walking through the neighborhood. … With Christmas lights already up on some homes, the three friends brought even more holiday spirit to the neighborhood.”

The president, without missing a beat, lied. “I didn’t delay anything,” Trump said at the time.

The next day, the Republican’s story changed and he tried to explain why his administration delayed the aid he’d just denied delaying. “We want to make sure that country is honest,” Trump told reporters. “It’s very important to talk about corruption. If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

From time to time, the White House and its allies will still pretend to take this line seriously, as if Trump, despite allegations of widespread corruption surrounding him and his team, has a deep and abiding concern related to possible Ukrainian malfeasance.

As the scandal has unfolded, the idea that the American president is sincere about this has always been laughable, and in recent days, the point has become even more absurd. Privately, administration officials keep making clear that Trump couldn’t have cared less about corruption in Ukraine, a point that’s been bolstered publicly during congressional impeachment proceedings. (When the National Security Council recommended that Trump bring up the issue during a phone meeting with Zelensky in April, and included specific talking points in briefing materials to emphasize the importance of the topic, Trump ignored the NSC, making his apparent indifference clear.)

This morning, however, these concerns came into sharper focus. Consider this exchange between House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as part of a clarification regarding the White House’s quid-pro-quo scheme.

SCHIFF: He had to get those two investigations if that official act was going to take place, correct? SONDLAND: [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky] had to announce the investigations. He didn’t actually have to do them, as I understood it.

A great many revelations have come to the fore today, many of which reinforce some of the worst fears surrounding Trump and his extortion scheme. This point about simply “announcing” investigations, without regard for follow through, is among the most striking.

In fact, there was a related exchange later on during the proceedings.

Later, Daniel Goldman, counsel for the House Democrats, pressed Sondland on the point. “You understood that in order to get that White House meeting that you wanted President Zelensky to have and that President Zelensky desperately wanted to have,” Goldman said, “that Ukraine would have to initiate these two investigations. Is that right?” “Well, they would have to announce that they were going to do it,” Sondland replied. “Right, because they – because Giuliani and President Trump didn’t actually care if they did them, right?” Goldman asked. “I never heard, Mr. Goldman, anyone say that the investigations had to start or had to be completed,” Sondland said. “The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani or otherwise was that they had to be announced in some form. And that form kept changing.” “Announced publicly?” Goldman asked. “Announced publicly,” Sondland replied.

In fairness, the way the ambassador characterized this wasn’t quite categorical. But if it’s true that Ukraine was asked to announce an investigation, without regard for actually conducting an investigation, it’s a significant revelation with broad implications.

If accurate, it means Trump and his team were solely concerned with public relations, not corruption. They wanted something that would serve a domestic political purpose in the form for a cudgel that could be used against a Democratic rival. (Some part of them may have even realized that if Ukraine bothered to do an investigation, it wouldn’t have turned up anything useful or interesting.)

In other words, what Sondland described was a scenario in which Team Trump cared about acquiring a talking point that could be used to embarrass Joe Biden – and nothing else."

“I’m wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,” Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked.

“No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,” Biden fired back before attacking the reporter.

“Only you would ask that,” Biden said. “You’re a good man. You’re a good man. Classy.”

CNN’S CHRIS CUOMO MOCKED AFTER ATTEMPT TO DISPROVE TRUMP’S PHONE THEORY WITH CALL TO MOM FAILS

DNA tests reportedly confirm ""with scientific certainty"" that Hunter Biden is the father, according to court documents filed in Arkansas on Wednesday.

In a motion to partially seal information about the baby from the public as part of an ongoing child support suit, an attorney for Lunden Alexis Roberts, the child's mom, asked that the name, sex and any other identifying information of the infant, referred to as Baby Doe in court documents, be withheld from public court records to protect the child from any attention associated with Joe Biden's prominency.

The attorney, Clinton Lancaster, informed the court in Independence County that because onetime Vice President Joe Biden ""is considered by some to be the person most likely to win his party’s nomination and challenge President Trump on the ballot in 2020,” the child and those close to him or her should be entitled to the same protections afforded to Biden's other kin.

""Baby Doe's paternity could put the child and those close to the child at risk of harm for the same reasons the Biden family is protected by the United States Secret Service,"" the document said.

MEDIA'S ‘CLUMSY HANDLING’ OF BOTCHED REPORT ATTRIBUTING OBAMA-ERA STATS TO TRUMP BLASTED BY CRITICS

""The goal is to make identifying information about the child more difficult to obtain,"" Lancaster told Fox News.

Roberts' paternity suit was first filed on May 28 when she alleged that she and Hunter Biden “were in a relationship” and that “Baby Doe” was born in August 2018 “as a result of that relationship,” according to reports by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENDS FUNDRAISING EMAIL CELEBRATING DEBATE PERFORMANCE HOURS BEFORE EVENT BEGINS

In July, Biden denied having sexual relations with Roberts, according to an article by The New Yorker. He agreed to submit to a paternity test in October. Wednesday's court filings said Biden ""is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process.""

This isn’t the first time Biden found an issue with Doocy’s questions on the campaign trail.

Back in August, Doocy issued a live fact check when Biden claimed to reporters that he drew larger crowds than other Democratic candidates.

""What I'm trying to do is go around from town to town and I'm drawing as big of crowds, or bigger than anybody,"" Biden said. ""Have you seen anybody draw bigger crowds than me in this state?""

""Yes,"" Doocy responded before noting that he saw a bigger crowd for Sen. Elizabeth Warren when she visited Des Moines in January.

""The vice president didn't seem to like that because a few minutes later he singled me out,"" Doocy explained, saying Biden referred to himself as a “big boy” during an exchange.

In September, Biden stuck his finger in Doocy’s face and told him to “ask the right questions” when the reporter attempted to get a comment on Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings.

The eight-day tour is set to cover 18 counties and is designed to help Biden's image, as his Democratic frontrunner status hangs in the balance.

The tour's name is likely derived from his 2012 vice presidential debate against former GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, when he told the Wisconsin Republican that his critique of the Obama administration's foreign policy was, ""a bunch of malarkey.""

“When Joe Biden first announced he was running, he told Iowans they’d be seeing a lot of him — and he meant it,” Biden campaign manager George Schultz said. “Being honest, upfront and authentic is core to who Joe Biden is and why Iowans love him.”

The tour is set to begin on Nov. 30 and will include stops in Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Mason City, Elkader, Decorah, and Oelwein.

Schultz added that ""when it comes to protecting health care, rebuilding the middle class, and defeating Donald Trump, Joe will continue laying out a clear vision about how he will deliver results for working families.""

Biden was mocked on Thursday by former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod during a CNN debate panel. Axelrod said Biden was ""Mr. Magooing his way"" through the primary.

""Biden, I wouldn’t say that he was a house of fire in any of the debates that we’ve been to. And yet he comes — kind of bumps along, kind of Mr. Magoo-ing his way through this,"" Axelrod said.

""And you keep worrying he’s going to hit a wall but he’s moving forward.”

However, Baier noted that Biden -- a longtime U.S. senator from Delaware before serving as VP under former President Barack Obama -- was never asked about his son Hunter Biden's international business dealings, including in Ukraine, which were a topic of discussion in Wednesday's impeachment hearings.

During the debate, Biden told the audience they should ask themselves which candidate is ""most likely to be able to win the presidency in the first place, and secondly who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate.""

He also remarked the day's impeachment hearings ""taught"" him an important idea.

""That Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee,"" Biden said.

Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Kiev, is the second witness to revise his testimony, after Gordon Sondland, in what appeared to be a gift to the Democrats.

He dropped his previous insistence that there was no talk of investigations at a crucial July 10 White House meeting that was cut short by John Bolton. Volker told the House hearing that Sondland made a “generic comment” about investigations and “all of us thought it was inappropriate.” This put him on the side of several other witnesses who expressed concern about President Trump freezing military aid to Ukraine.

TRUMP TEASES IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY AMID SCANDAL FATIGUE

However, Volker said he must have left or been involved in a side conversation because he didn’t hear Bolton express his strong objections to what had just happened. And although he was a point of contact for Rudy Giuliani, he claimed to be “out of the loop” on the linkage between the aid and Ukraine promising to investigate the Bidens or its role in the 2016 election—a linkage he now calls “unacceptable.”

What’s more, Volker said he has known Biden for many years, that he deems the former VP an “honorable man,” and that allegations that he acted improperly with Ukraine “are just not credible to me.”

Volker remained doggedly low key, obviously trying to thread the needle between openly breaking with Trump and distancing himself from the withholding of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. He said he should have realized that the push for Ukrainian investigations was actually specifically aimed at probing the gas giant Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden.

But he opened himself up to charges of inconsistency, especially since he just happened to recall the mention of Ukrainian investigations after other witnesses recounted that—in more detail—at the meeting attended by Volker.

For the Democrats, the late afternoon admissions salvaged what had been a sleepy third day of hearings.

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, sitting ramrod straight with a chest full of medals, said flatly that “it was improper for the president to demand an investigation of a political opponent,” especially from a foreign power.

And yet his testimony was oddly anti-climactic.

True to his military bearing, Vindman was stiff, hesitant and by the book, answering questions at the House impeachment hearing in an unwavering monotone.

He says he conveyed concern about President Trump’s call with Volodomyr Zelensky “through official channels,” through the “chain of command,” acting only “to carry out my duty.” He bristled when ranking Republican Devin Nunes called him “Mr. Vindman” and asked to be addressed by his title.

Vindman’s military service as a career officer, including a Purple Heart, after his family fled the Soviet Union was admirable. But his testimony was far less compelling than the appearances of William Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch.

More important, virtually everything that Vindman had to say had already been leaked or released. He said John Bolton had abruptly ended a July 10 meeting after Gordon Sondland spoke of Ukraine’s need to investigate the Bidens and any role in 2016 hacking. He said he told a White House lawyer that Trump raising investigations with Ukraine’s leader was “inappropriate” and “had nothing to do with national security.” These points are important, but old news.

Vindman, to his credit, was so cautious that he when he was asked why the official readout on the Trump-Zelensky call cited anti-corruption efforts when that was not mentioned, he said it was common to include such messaging.

The lieutenant colonel had two noteworthy moments. One was when he said he could not deliver such testimony in his birthplace, the old Soviet Union. The other was when he said the attacks on last week’s witnesses were “vile” and “reprehensible.”

Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Pence who listened to the July 25 call, said she found it “a domestic political matter.” But she didn’t have much behind-the-scenes information—she put it in Pence’s briefing book but doesn’t know if he read it—and no one landed a glove on her.

Williams said she was “surprised” when the president tweeted that she was a Never Trumper. She denied that, saying “I was not expecting to be called out by name.” Vindman said he is not a Never Trumper, he was a “Never Partisan.”

The Intel Committee session hit a snag when Adam Schiff accused the GOP counsel, and later Jim Jordan, of trying to out the whistle-blower by asking Vindman about his testimony that he’d told an intelligence community official about the Trump call. In the first instance, Schiff’s intervention led Vindman to decline to answer.

The president, at a Cabinet meeting, said he didn’t know who Vindman was and questioned why he testified in full-dress military attire.

Despite the unmistakably subdued tone of the morning hearing, some pundits were excited by the session.

MSNBC, which has abandoned a straight-news approach to the hearings, had its coverage anchored by host Nicolle Wallace, a former Republican who detests Trump (after Chris Matthews was the anchor on Friday). Wallace called the testimony “stunning.” Another liberal host, Ari Melber, said it was “devastating.” Former Democratic senator Claire McCaskill said part of it was “powerful.”

On CNN, whose coverage was anchored by journalists, John King said Republicans are “cherry picking” and their questioning of witnesses’ character is “a sideshow.” Jeffrey Toobin said Trump’s culpability “has been proven over and over again.”

On Fox, whose coverage was anchored by journalists, former special prosecutor Ken Starr said Vindman has “a great American story” but had acknowledged that there was nothing illegal about Trump freezing military aid to Ukraine.

Earlier, Nunes took direct aim at the media and the whistle-blower, even questioning whether the CIA officer has been in touch with journalists.

Nunes, who boasted that ""TV ratings are way down,"" repeatedly insisted that the testimony of three career diplomats last week was far less important and dramatic than portrayed in media accounts. He then pivoted to Russia, reciting headlines from that investigation that he said were false.

I’m not one who believes the hearings have to be a raucous TV show. If there is damaging new information, it doesn’t matter if it’s delivered in a reading-from-the-phone-book tone. But it was Kurt Volker, not Alexander Vindman, who made news Tuesday by changing his story."

In a motion to partially seal information about the child from the public as part of an ongoing child support suit, an attorney for Lunden Alexis Roberts, an Arkansas woman and the child's mom, asked that the name, sex and any other identifying information of the infant, referred to as Baby Doe in court documents, be withheld from public court records to protect the child from any attention associated with Joe Biden's prominency.

BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENDS FUNDRAISING EMAIL CELEBRATING DEBATE PERFORMANCE HOURS BEFORE EVENT BEGINS

The attorney, Clinton Lancaster, informed the court in Independence County that because onetime Vice President Joe Biden ""is considered by some to be the person most likely to win his party’s nomination and challenge President Trump on the ballot in 2020,” the child and those close to it should be entitled to the same protections afforded to Biden's other kin.

""Baby Doe's paternity could put the child and those close to the child at risk of harm for the same reasons the Biden family is protected by the United States Secret Service,"" the document said.

""The goal is to make identifying information about the child more difficult to obtain,"" Lancaster told Fox News.

Roberts' paternity suit was first filed on May 28 when she alleged that she and Hunter Biden “were in a relationship” and that “Baby Doe” was born in August 2018 “as a result of that relationship,” according to reports by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

In July, Biden denied having sexual relations with Roberts, according to an article by The New Yorker. He agreed to submit to a paternity test in October.

Separate attacks by President Trump against Joe and Hunter Biden have become fodder for the ongoing impeachment inquiry spearheaded by three Democrat-led House committees.

Pence Chief of Staff Marc Short said in a statement that the purported conversation between him and Sondland “never happened.”

“The vice president never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations,” Pence said in his statement. “Ambassador Gordon Sondland was never alone with Vice President Pence on the September 1 trip to Poland. This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened.”

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS: LIVE UPDATES FROM DAY FOUR

Sondland on Wednesday morning said in his opening statement that he had spoken to Pence about the delay in military aid to Ukraine, voicing concern this was tied to investigations. Sondland said he believed the aid would not be released until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government announced an investigation concerning the Bidens.

“I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations,” Sondland said. “During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. The Vice President said he would speak to President Trump about it.”

Sondland added: “Based on my communications with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. [Andriy] Yermak [an aide to Zelensky]. In a very brief pull-aside conversation, that happened within a few seconds, I told Mr. Yermak that I believed that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.”

Sondland also made clear he never heard directly from Trump on such a quid pro quo.

The impeachment inquiry into Trump began when a whistleblower reported that the president had pushed Zelensky to launch a public investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine—specifically, why former Vice President Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings.

Hunter Biden worked for the Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev.

Sondland told the House Intelligence Committee that he never heard Trump say that military aid to Ukraine was conditioned on a public announcement by the Ukrainian president that the country was investigating Democrats, but he added that it was clear that a meeting in the White House between Trump and Zelensky was conditioned on investigations.

He also said Trump never told him a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president would not happen without a public announcement. He heard that from Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

Sondland said it was a personal guess that the military aid was being held up until an announcement, one that others eventually also made.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., applauded his colleague on producing ""the real bombshell"" of Sondland's long-anticipated testimony and marked the moment as ""game over,"" for the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry. That inquiry is focusing on an alleged quid pro quo between President Trump and Ukraine linking military aid and White House access to Ukraine probes beneficial to Trump.

During a fiery exchange, Turner focused on the Republican Party's main defense of Trump, asking Sondland: ""Is that your testimony today, Mr. Sondland? That you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation to the aid? Because I don't think you're saying that.""

Sondland admitted that he was ""presuming"" the stalled military aid was linked to Trump allegedly asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens' financial interests in Ukraine.

SONDLAND IMPLICATES TOP OFFICIALS ON UKRAINE, BUT SAYS HE 'NEVER HEARD' QUID PRO QUO FROM TRUMP

""So no one told you,"" Turner pressed on. ""Not just the president. Giuliani didn't tell you, Mulvaney didn't tell you. Nobody. Pompeo didn't tell you. Nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct?""

The congressman cut Sondland off, restating his point: ""No one on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying this aid to the investigations, because if your answer is yes, then the chairman is wrong and the headline on CNN is wrong. No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations. Yes or no?""

""Yes,"" Sondland replied.

""So, you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations?"" Turner asked.

""Other than my own presumption,"" Sondland said.

Throughout Wednesday's testimony, Sondland insisted that although he never explicitly heard the president or anyone in the administration demand investigations in exchange for aid, he never got a clear answer on why the aid was held up. He said the absence of a clear explanation led him to believe that the aid and the investigations were being linked.

Turner dismissed Sondland's ""presumption"" as ""nothing"" and called his testimony ""made up.""

""You know what hearsay evidence is, ambassador?"" Turner said. ""Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. Do you know what made-up testimony is? Made-up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean you're just assuming all of these things and then you're giving them the evidence that they're running out and doing press conferences and CNN's headline is saying that you're saying the president of the United States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations -- and you don't know that. Correct?""

""I never said the president of the United States should be impeached,"" Sondland responded.

Still, Sondland's earlier testimony to the committee linked the potential Ukraine investigations and a White House meeting and call between Trump and Zelensky. He said Giuliani played an integral, if not unconventional, role in those arrangements -- and he said he explicitly expressed his fears about an inappropriate quid pro quo.

“I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo?"" Sondland said. ""As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.”"

""I think Trump did it, I think he's absolutely guilty of pressuring Ukraine into a quid pro quo, now we can say what were the terms of the quid pro quo, was the aid part of it or not part of it? We can have those kinds of arguments, but it is just flatly obvious to me and to literally every Republican on the Hill I've talked to that he's guilty, that he did it.""

Goldberg also addressed Hunter Biden getting a pass and President Trump's ""obsession"" with him:

So lets assume you're absolutely right, it had absolutely nothing to do with 2020 and it just has to do with Trump's seething resentment that he got a hard time and Joe Biden didn't. That's not in the national interest either, that is indulging your pet grievances and holding up military aid and all these other things because you're ticked off and you're offended.""

Lastly, Goldberg stood by his position that President Trump only cares about corruption when it comes to Ukraine, saying ""he doesn't care about corruption anywhere else in the world.""

Jordan, the ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, has been appointed as a temporary member of the House Intelligence Committee.

“The American people understand how you have affirmatively prevented Republicans from examining serious issues directly relevant to the issues,” the two GOP lawmakers told Schiff in their letter. “Therefore, to provide some basic level of fairness and objectivity to your ‘impeachment inquiry,’ we intend to subpoena the anonymous whistleblower and Hunter Biden for sworn testimony in closed-door depositions.”

Nunes and Jordan added that they plan to subpoena the whistleblower’s documents and communications regarding the complaint, the records surrounding Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings and the Democratic National Committee’s communications with Ukrainian officials and records relating to Alexandra Chalupa.

A Ukrainian-American consultant for the Democratic National Committee, Chalupa allegedly had meetings with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C. to discuss incriminating information about Trump campaign officials during the 2016 presidential election.

This is the second letter that Nunes has sent to Schiff that relayed his intentions to call the whistleblower and Hunter Biden.

Earlier this month, Nunes sent a similar letter to Schiff about wanting those witnesses, but it remains unclear how many of the Republicans’ proposed witnesses will be approved by Schiff. A recently approved resolution governing the impeachment inquiry gave the approval power to the chairman and the members of the majority.

""To provide transparency to your otherwise opaque and unfair process, and after consultation with [House Oversight Committee] Ranking Member Jim Jordan and [House Foreign Affairs Committee] Ranking Member Michael McCaul, the American people deserve to hear from the following witnesses in an open setting,"" Nunes said in his earlier letter.

Graham’s letter, which was released as the final day of public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump wrapped up, asked Pompeo to release a series of documents and transcripts of conversations in 2016 between Biden and Poroshenko in relation to an investigation into the Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.

Burisma – and more specifically, Hunter Biden’s role on the company’s board of directors – has become one of the main talking points from Trump and the Republicans amid the impeachment inquiry into the president.

READ: GORDON SONDLAND'S IMPEACHMENT HEARING OPENING STATEMENT

Speaking on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Wednesday night, Graham said the phone calls between Biden and Poroshenko coincided with the time frame in which a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired.

“I want to know, are there any transcripts or readouts of the phone calls between the vice president and the president of Ukraine in February [2016] after the raid on the gas company president's house,” Graham said. “After this raid, Hunter Biden kicks in. Hunter Biden's business partner meets with [then-Secretary of State] John Kerry, and Vice President Biden on three occasions makes a phone call to the president of Ukraine and goes over there in March and they fire the guy, and this is the same man that the ambassador wanted investigated in 2015.”

Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings at a time when Hunter Biden sat on its board and while the vice president was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, many Western nations had supported Shokin’s firing.

Jordan, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, has been appointed as a temporary member of the House Intelligence Committee.

“The American people understand how you have affirmatively prevented Republicans from examining serious issues directly relevant to the issues,” the two GOP lawmakers told Schiff in their letter. “Therefore, to provide some basic level of fairness and objectivity to your ‘impeachment inquiry,’ we intend to subpoena the anonymous whistleblower and Hunter Biden for sworn testimony in closed-door depositions.”

The whistleblower last August reported that Trump had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch a public investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine—specifically, why the former vice president pressured Poroshenko to fire Shokin. The complaint questioned whether Trump withheld military aid and the opportunity of a White House meeting from Zelensky until Ukraine publicly announced an investigation into the Bidens. Trump and the White House repeatedly have denied the president did anything wrong.

On Wednesday, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland said he never heard directly from Trump on a quid pro quo linking military aid for Ukraine to politically advantageous investigations.

But, Sondland said, “we all understood” that a meeting at the White House for Ukraine’s president and a phone call with Trump would happen only if Zelensky agreed to an investigation into the 2016 U.S. election and the Bidens. And, he testified that he came to presume aid was linked to investigations too.

He said he sent an email on July 19, just days before the July 25 call at the center of the impeachment inquiry, in which he laid out the issue in detail to members of the State and Energy Departments and White House staff.

Sondland added: “It was no secret.”

Perhaps the most startling news of the day was that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is continuing to block progress on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade, apparently in exchange for commitments on impeachment.

As we consider key takeaways, keep in mind that last week’s witnesses never spoke to President Trump. They also were not on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – the call that launched the baseless impeachment inquiry.

TOM DEL BECCARO: ADAM SCHIFF’S IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS MOST ONE-SIDED IN HISTORY – A POLITICAL ATTACK ON GOP

By contrast, two of the witnesses Tuesday were listening in on the call. They are National Security Council Ukraine expert Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and State Department Foreign Service Officer Jennifer Williams, who is an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence on Europe and Russia.

The other witnesses testifying Tuesday have firsthand knowledge of the evolving relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine. They are former U.S. Special Representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker and former National Security Council aide Tim Morrison.

Overall, here are the key takeaways from Tuesday’s testimony.

The day of the diplomat

The early testimony has been dominated by diplomats, along with Lt. Col. Vindman.

All of these people told us about their foreign policy views – diplomatic views the Democrats suddenly find inviolate. The Democrats do this despite the fact that they did not press President Barack Obama to give military aid to Ukraine that those same witnesses favored at the time.

Among those views, consider Vindman’s deposition testimony that he and other foreign policy experts in government have “the best, most informed judgment.” He said he was the “most knowledgeable” and said it was not appropriate for other government officials to act to “counter” the views of him and his fellow experts.

Perhaps Vindman’s feeling of self-importance can be placed in context, given that he was offered a senior position in Ukraine as defense minister, which he said he declined and never considered accepting.

Democrats have double standards

These hearings have demonstrated that our ambassadors and other U.S. government officials were involved in the internal politics of Ukraine. Indeed, when he was vice president, Joe Biden engineered the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor.

Just imagine if a Ukrainian official was able to have former Special Counsel Robert Mueller fired.

Vindman testified that he told Ukrainian officials that they should not get involved in American domestic politics. So why are Democrats suddenly OK with America intervening in Ukraine’s internal politics? Likely for the same reason they said nothing when President Obama worked to defeat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israeli elections.

Republicans put Joe Biden on trial in absentia

Before Tuesday, there had been a fairly one-sided story told about Ukraine. That story was that President Trump was wrong to seek information about the activities of Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.

Tuesday was different, however. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told a national audience tuning in on TV these important facts:

A) In September 2015 the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine asked for an investigation into the president of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company on whose board Hunter Biden served, reportedly at a salary of about $50,000 per month. Hunter Biden has no expertise on Ukraine or on the natural gas industry.

B) Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who testified last week in the impeachment hearings, characterized Hunter Biden’s position on the Burisma board while his father was vice president as a potential conflict of interest (as other witnesses have confirmed).

C) Burisma routed over $3 million to accounts tied to Hunter Biden.

D) Burisma’s American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after Joe Biden forced the firing of the Ukraine’s chief prosecutor, who was looking into Burisma.

E) Burisma’s lawyers pressured the U.S. State Department in February 2016, after a law enforcement raid on the home of Burisma’s president, and used Hunter Biden’s name as a reason to intervene.

F) Joe Biden called the president of Ukraine at least three times after the raid on the home of Burisma’s president.

Learning these facts, which are based on documents and interviews, the question is whether the American people will now see that, at the very least, the Bidens should not be above investigation – and that Joe Biden may have acted to serve the best interest of his son when demanding the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor.

Outing the whistleblower

Perhaps the tensest moments of the hearing were when Vindman refused to answer questions about who he spoke to about the Trump-Zelensky phone call.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. – who lied about his committee’s contacts with the so-called whistleblower, who kicked off the whole impeachment inquiry – stepped into that discussion to stop any possibility of outing the whistleblower.

Schiff’s motivation for doing that may well be to hide his own wrongdoing.

The Democrats’ bias against President Trump

This entire impeachment inquiry is based on the Democrats’ view that President Trump could only have acted in his own personal interest when asking about information related to the Bidens.

The Democrats refuse to acknowledge that Trump’s actions could have been prompted by a different motivation – that he was requesting information pursuant to a U.S.-Ukrainian treaty that permits heads of state to request information related to investigations – in this case, a U.S. investigation.

On the other hand, despite ample evidence that Joe Biden could have been acting in his own self-interest, the Democrats say the only possible conclusion for Biden’s motivation was innocent. The Democrats claim Bind was acting on the consensus view (which Biden helped build) that the prosecutor had to be fired because he was corrupt.

In other words, the Democrats assert President Trump can only act in his own self-interest and that Joe Biden could only be acting in our national interest.

Also, it may be that the Ukrainian prosecutor fired under pressure from Biden was corrupt. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the prosecutor’s investigation of Burisma was a corrupt act. Indeed, witnesses testifying before Schiff’s committee have made it abundantly clear that Burisma was corrupt.

Schiff is making inaccurate statements

In advance of each witness, Chairman Schiff gave what amounted to a statement summarizing the evidence as he sees it. The witnesses, however, have not testified consistent with Schiff’s summaries, as the cross-examination by the Republicans has often established.

Vindman’s speculation didn’t provide any damning facts

It was telling that at one point Vindman suggested that his opinion was “informed speculation.” In plain truth, the facts at issue remain rather few and are not as damning as Schiff and the Democrats claim.

It is true that Trump sought investigations related to the Bidens. It is true that the Ukrainians wanted military aid. However, as the policy developed, and more was learned about the new Ukrainian president, the aid was given without restriction and without a quid pro quo, according to Volker, who painted an image of a developing and complicated process.

Further, as Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, pointed out at the hearing, the two witnesses listening to the Trump-Zelensky phone call had different views on the importance of the call.

Based on all of the above, the Democrats didn’t advance the ball on the third day of the impeachment hearings. Indeed, Volker and Morrison undercut the Democrats.

On the other hand, Tuesday’s hearing harmed Joe Biden’s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination – and, given the length and lack of revealing information at the hearing, it may have caused Americans’ eyes to roll at the thought of impeachment.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), still the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, continues to approach Donald Trump’s impeachment inquiry in deeply strange ways. In fact, what’s become clear over the last week or so is that the Republican congressman’s efforts to defend the president fall into three categories.

The first is to play an awkward projection, rubber-glue game. Aware that the White House’s critics see Trump as peddling outlandish conspiracy theories to cult-like followers, Nunes accused Democrats of peddling outlandish conspiracy theories to cult-like followers. Aware of John Bolton’s description of the president’s Ukraine scheme as a “drug deal,” Nunes yesterday described the impeachment inquiry as a “drug deal.”

The second part of the strategy is to use the proceedings to advance discredited partisan arguments. Yesterday, for example, Nunes accused Joe Biden of “threatening to withhold U.S. loan guarantees unless the Ukrainians fired a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.” We already know that’s not even close to what actually happened.

But the third prong of Nunes’ defense is pretending Trump didn’t do things we already know he did. The Republican congressman made this pitch this morning as the impeachment proceedings got underway on Capitol Hill:

“In their mania to attack the president, no conspiracy theory is too outlandish for the Democrats. “Time and again, they floated the possibility of some far-fetched malfeasance by Trump, declared the dire need to investigate it, and then suddenly dropped the issue and moved on to their next asinine theory.”

Nunes proceeded to list a series of “accusations and insinuations,” which included Democrats alleging that Trump “received nefarious materials from the Russians through a Trump campaign aide”; Trump had “a diabolical plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow”; and Trump “changed the Republican National Committee platform to hurt Ukraine and benefit Russia.”

The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee described each of these as “false charges” and “ludicrous accusations,” which would be more compelling if they were, in fact, false and ludicrous.

We know, for example, that Roger Stone, a former Trump campaign aide, was convicted of multiple felonies – just four days ago – and as part of the trial, other former Trump campaign aides said Stone was seen as the point person on learning about materials stolen by Russia.

We also know that Trump really did have a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, which was an endeavor Trump pursued during his presidential campaign, and which was something the president lied about.

We also know that the Trump campaign really did change the RNC platform to hurt Ukraine and benefit Russia.

I suppose the follow-up question for Devin Nunes is simple: how does he not know that the “false charges” he listed this morning aren’t, in reality, false?"

During an appearance on ""Hannity"" Wednesday, host Sean Hannity noted Horowitz will be coming before Graham's committee on Dec. 11 to testify on the matter and went on to ask Graham not to allow a Friday night document ""dump"" that could muffle the coverage of the news.

In response, Graham smiled and nodded.

""It'll be December 9th — you'll get the report,"" the South Carolina lawmaker said.

MICHAEL HOROWITZ: FINALIZING OF FISA PROBE REPORT 'NEARING COMPLETION'

""That's locked.""

Horowitz told congressional lawmakers in an October letter that his investigation and ensuing report were nearing their conclusion.

The ""lengthy"" draft report ""concerns sensitive national security and law enforcement matters,"" Horowitz wrote in the letter, adding that he anticipated ""the final report will be released publicly with few redactions.""

Horowitz noted that he did not anticipate a need to prepare or issue ""separate classified and public versions of the report.""

""After we receive the final classification markings from the Department and the FBI, we will then proceed with our usual process for preparing a final report, including ensuring that appropriate reviews occur for accuracy and comment purposes,"" Horowitz wrote in the letter. ""Once begun, we do not anticipate the time for that review to be lengthy.""

BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENDS FUNDRAISING EMAIL CELEBRATING DEBATE PERFORMANCE HOURS BEFORE EVENT BEGINS

Graham further broke news on ""Hannity"" when he confirmed he is sending a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the transcripts of three phone calls the senator said then-Vice President Joe Biden had with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

Graham said the phone calls coincided with the time frame in which a Ukrainian prosecutor, once praised for going after the head of natural gas company Burisma Holdings – a person Graham said was known as the ""dirtiest guy in Ukraine"" by one top American official – was fired.

Burisma was the company on which Hunter Biden, the son of the 2020 Democratic candidate, sat on the board.

""I want to know are there any transcripts or readouts of the phone calls between the vice president and the president of Ukraine in February [2016] after the raid on the gas company president's house,"" said Graham. ""After this raid, Hunter Biden kicks in. Hunter Biden's business partner meets with [then-Secretary of State] John Kerry, and Vice President Biden on three occasions makes a phone call to the president of Ukraine and goes over there in March and they fire the guy, and this is the same man that the ambassador wanted investigated in 2015.""

Graham added he found it ""odd"" that instead of lauding the Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, for investigating the Burisma chairman, he was instead relieved of his duties.

He said that in 2015, President Obama's ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, said in a speech he wanted Shokin to be more forceful in his investigation of domestic corruption.

""The one person he named as being a sleazebag was the president of Burisma,"" Graham remarked.

At the same time, Cooper said she was under the impression the aid was restricted simply due to the Trump administration's concerns over ""corruption"" in Ukraine. Cooper testified she was never provided any other explanation for the hold, though others have asserted it was tied to the effort to extract an investigation of the Bidens.

Similarly, top State Department official David Hale, sitting alongside Cooper, testified that he was unaware of any ""nefarious"" motive by the Trump administration in withholding the aid. He said financial assistance to several other countries was withheld as well.

In a blow to GOP arguments that Ukraine was unaware of the aid holdup this summer, though, Cooper said that her staff had made her aware of ""two unclassified emails"" from the State Department, both from July 25. One email indicated that the Ukrainian Embassy and House Foreign Affairs Committee ""are asking about security assistance."" The second, also on July 25, said that ""the Hill knows about the FMF [Foreign Military Financing] situation to an extent, and so does the Ukrainian Embassy.""

It's unclear whether that meant Kiev was specifically aware of the hold at that time; the White House reportedly countered that this was merely an assumption.

But the emails would appear to suggest some awareness of a problem, and Cooper said her staff believed that Ukraine was at least “aware of the hold on security assistance” in August, though she couldn’t point to specific conversations in which it came up.

SONDLAND SAYS TRUMP EXPLICITLY RULED OUT QUID PRO QUO

Ukrainian Embassy staff, Cooper said, asked ""what is going on"" with their military aid. Although she stressed she had never talked to Trump about the matter, Cooper said she made an ""inference"" that the aid would be released if Ukraine issued a public statement on corruption.

Cooper's remarks updated her earlier testimony in a closed-door deposition and provided new information that Ukraine may have been aware of the aid suspension earlier than previously thought. During his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump suggested Zelensky investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine, including the former vice president's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid while the prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board.

""In July, I became aware of a hold being placed on the obligation of State Department's Foreign Military Financing and DoD's USAI funds,"" Cooper said. ""In a series of interagency meetings, I heard that the president had directed the Office of Management and Budget to hold the funds because of his concerns about corruption in Ukraine. Let me say at the outset that I have never discussed this or any other matter with the president and never heard directly from him about this matter.""

Separately, Cooper said she was ""proud"" that the Trump administration had agreed to equip Ukraine with anti-tank Javelin missiles, which the Obama administration had not provided.

""This was a very important decision to support Ukraine with this capability,"" Cooper said.

Cooper and Hale were testifying under subpoena Wednesday evening in Democrats' impeachment inquiry, after President Trump claimed vindication from European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland's blockbuster remarks earlier in the day.

Hale testified that aid was withheld from other countries besides Ukraine, including Honduras, Lebanon, and Pakistan. He said it was not unusual for the White House not to provide a specific explanation for why aid was being withheld. However, Hale said that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the White House was the only agency that didn't support lifting the hold on aid for Ukraine.

Under questioning from Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, Hale clarified that he was unaware of any ""nefarious"" motive for withholding aid to Ukraine, and had no information to suggest that there was a quid pro quo for investigations. He said it was a ""general impression"" at the State Department that Trump was skeptical of providing foreign aid.

In blockbuster testimony hours earlier, Sondland tied top Trump administration officials to a “potential quid pro quo” involving U.S. military aid to Ukraine and investigations desired by the president, but he acknowledged under cross-examination from Republicans that he never heard that from Trump -- saying he was making presumptions and the president expressly rejected any such arrangement. Democrats, though, argued that Sondland nevertheless described a quid pro quo arrangement in his testimony, suggesting Trump must have been involved.

Cooper testified last month that the Trump administration had pushed Ukraine to issue a public statement disavowing any efforts to influence U.S. elections -- but she stopped short of saying that officials wanted to include a reference to Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country.

Additionally, Cooper has testified that Pentagon officials began receiving ""phone calls from industry"" -- apparently referring to private companies that supply weapons and military hardware to the government -- after President Trump initiated a hold on military aid to Ukraine earlier this year.

Cooper also testified about Defense Department concerns that Trump's temporary withholding of military aid to Ukraine may have been illegal. The legalities likely regarded the issue of ""impoundment"" – the requirement that the president either had to spend the money or ""impound"" it. The White House was coming up against an impoundment deadline when it released the funds for Ukraine.

DOD OFFICIAL SAYS PRIVATE INDUSTRY PRESSURED PENTAGON TO RESUME AID TO UKRAINE

Cooper said Defense Department officials were concerned that Trump's decision would weaken a ""strategic partner.""

Under questioning on Wednesday, she reiterated that Ukraine is a vital strategic partner to the United States.

Meanwhile, Hale -- the State Department’s No. 3 official -- testified in a Nov. 6 closed-door deposition that no one in the Trump administration or any ""government channel"" ever mentioned Joe or Hunter Biden as a reason for withholding aid from Ukraine, according to a transcript of his remarks.

Democrats have argued that the White House improperly pressured Ukraine to look into the Bidens and Burisma, the natural gas company where Hunter Biden held a lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president.

George Kent, a State Department official who has also testified in the impeachment investigation, said he flagged Hunter Biden's apparent conflict of interest to the Obama administration at the time.

However, Hale said, he saw the Bidens referenced only in media reports -- as well as in a ""speculative"" email from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who testified last week.

Yovanovitch ""mentioned that Mayor [Rudy] Giuliani might have been motivated to sully Vice President Biden's reputation by reminding the world of the issue regarding his son's activities in Ukraine,"" Hale testified, referring to President Trump's personal attorney.

Hale and Cooper's testimony came shortly after Sondland tied top officials to the “potential quid pro quo” involving U.S. military aid to Ukraine and investigations desired by Trump – yet said he never heard that link from the president himself.

One of the key witnesses in the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry against Trump, Sondland claimed he kept Secretary of State Mike Pompeo aware of what was going on and said he specifically told Vice President Pence he ""had concerns"" the military aid to Ukraine ""had become tied"" to investigations -- though a Pence aide denied it. And he repeatedly lambasted Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s leading role in the administration’s Ukraine dealings.

""Everyone was in the loop,"" Sondland testified. ""It was no secret.""

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS BIDEN, BURISMA NOT MENTIONED REGARDING AID HOLDUP

He testified to a clear ""quid pro quo"" linking a White House meeting with Ukraine's president to the investigation request, even as he couched his language regarding the aid.

In comments touted by Trump later in the day, Sondland clarified: “I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement"" of investigations. He said he never personally heard Trump discuss preconditions. And at one point, he confirmed Trump told him, ""I want nothing.""

Throughout, Republicans sought to emphasize their view that the impeachment proceedings were fundamentally unfair. House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., kicked off the questioning in the afternoon hearing by focusing on the potential witnesses who had been blocked from appearing by Democrats.

""I’d like to take a moment to discuss a few of the people whose testimony has been deemed unacceptable for the American people to hear,"" Nunes said. ""The whistleblower is the key figure who started this entire impeachment charade by submitting a complaint against President Trump that relied on second-hand and third-hand information and media reports.""

Nunes then pointed to Alexandra Chalupa, whom he called a ""former operative for the Democratic National Committee who worked with officials of the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington D.C. in order to smear the Trump campaign.""

He concluded: ""Hunter Biden is another witness who the Democrats are sparing from cross-examination. His securing of an extremely well-paying job on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian company, Burisma, highlights the precise corruption problem in Ukraine that concerned not only President Trump, but all the witnesses we’ve interviewed. ... The Democrats have dismissed questions about Biden’s role at Burisma as conspiracy theories, yet they’re trying to impeach President Trump for having expressed concerns about the company."""

Bribery. Contempt of Congress. Obstruction of justice.

Those are the four potential articles of impeachment that House Judiciary Committee Democrats could draw up against President Trump as soon as next month, Fox News is told, after all scheduled public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up on a testy note Thursday.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House on Thursday afternoon, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

It remained possible the House Intelligence Committee could schedule more hearings, although no additional hearings are expected during Thanksgiving week. Or, the committee could prepare a report on its findings for the House Judiciary Committee -- which would have the option of holding its own hearings or simply drafting articles of impeachment outright.

Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such hearings. But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

Graham, coming out of the White House discussion, added that ""we didn't talk about"" how to mount a case to ""defend the president.""

Instead, Graham said, the discussion centered around ""how would the trial start -- you know, they'll make a request for witnesses, but that would have to be granted by the Senate, I guess that's the way we did it before.""

Graham continued, ""My preference was to try to follow the Clinton model as much as possible.""

Clinton was acquitted on both perjury and obstruction counts in February 1999, with each vote falling fall short of the two-thirds majority required for removal.

In the Senate, impeachment procedures would allow witnesses to be called by the president's defense lawyers, GOP senators and a team of House Democrats who essentially would serve as prosecutors. The big catch: Republicans would need enough votes from the 53 GOP senators to muster a majority and prevent Democrats from blocking them.

Assuming Republican senators would stay united -- not a guarantee -- Trump's defenders could try refocusing the inquiry by seeking testimony from people like Hunter Biden, the son of 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

During his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to a whistleblower complaint touching off the impeachment inquiry, Trump suggested Zelensky investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine, including the former vice president's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid while the prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board.

Hunter Biden held that lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president. If Senate Republicans could put forward evidence showing the president's concerns about the Bidens' potential corruption were legitimate, they could undercut Democrats' central argument for impeachment.

On Thursday, Graham strongly signaled that Hunter Biden would be a key GOP focus. He sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents ""related to contacts between Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.""

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified behind closed doors last month that he and other officials had qualms about Hunter Biden's lucrative role on the board of Burisma at the time.

""What Republicans want to do is broaden the story,"" said David Hoppe, who was chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., during Clinton's impeachment trial.

And, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said Thursday he'd like Senate testimony from the still-anonymous whistleblower, whose House appearance Democrats have blocked. Cramer said he might also like to hear from both Bidens and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

The White House has signaled it will mount an aggressive defense. ""When this goes over to the Senate, you know, the people that actually started this thing, they are going to be put on the stand,"" Eric Trump, the president's son, told reporters Thursday. He said that would include ""heads of the Democratic Party.""

For his part, Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration.""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

At Tuesday’s marathon session in Intelligence Committee proceedings, that continue on Wednesday and Thursday, other witnesses were invited to testify that they knew of no basis to believe Ukrainian officials had interfered in the 2016 election. Indeed, Democrats continued to press their disingenuous storyline that Ukraine could not have meddled in our presidential campaign because Russia did, as if it were not possible that both countries meddled – as it is virtually certain that both did, on opposite sides.

There has been a common thread in the testimony on these two subjects, potential Biden corruption and 2016 Ukrainian collusion with Democrats: There is no basis to believe, and none has been offered, that the witnesses Democrats permitted to be called have any relevant information about these matters.

SEN. THOM TILLIS: DEMOCRATS DENY TRUMP DUE PROCESS IN IMPEACHMENT PUSH

This testimony would not be allowed in a court proceeding under rules of evidence and due process, where witnesses are permitted to address only matters about which they have direct knowledge. If they only know what they’ve read in the papers, their testimony isn’t any more reliable than ours would be.

This is why, for all the formal trappings and somber tones, Democrats are running a kangaroo court.

The hearings are taking place under one-sided rules that enable Chairman Adam Schiff, a fierce partisan, to determine which witnesses are permitted to testify.

Republicans have asked to call such witnesses as Hunter Biden, Nellie Ohr, and Alexandra Chalupa. Biden the younger was lavishly compensated by a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, while his father was running Obama administration Ukraine policy and demanding that Kiev fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.

Ohr was a researcher at Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign opposition research arm that produced the bogus Steele dossier.

She testified in a 2018 House investigation that Fusion’s informants included Ukrainian parliamentarian Serhiy Leshchenko – an overt Clinton supporter.

In late 2018, a Ukrainian court found the Leshchenko and an official of Ukraine’s anti-corruption police meddled in the 2016 American election by, among other things, leaking information damaging to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort – who was forced to resign. Leschchenko was reportedly also a source for Chalupa, a Ukrainian-born DNC consultant and Hillary Clinton supporter.

For all the formal trappings and somber tones, Democrats are running a kangaroo court. The hearings are taking place under one-sided rules that enable Chairman Adam Schiff, a fierce partisan, to determine which witnesses are permitted to testify.

Schiff has denied Republicans the opportunity to call these witnesses, just as he has denied the GOP the ability to ask questions about the so-called whistleblower who instigated the Ukraine impeachment push (a CIA official who is known to have consulted with Schiff’s staff while preparing his complaint).

According to Schiff, the Republicans must not be permitted to question their preferred witnesses because possible Biden corruption and Ukrainian interference in the election for the benefit of Hillary Clinton are not relevant topics. The only matter in focus is President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s government – i.e., the slow-walking of defense aid to pressure Kyiv to conduct investigations “that would benefit Trump politically.”

This, of course, is absurd. In their tunnel vision, what Democrats call the investigations that “would benefit Trump politically” are precisely Biden corruption and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election.

Schiff & Co. mulishly insist that Trump was motivated by nothing other than his political fortunes in the 2020 campaign. Obviously, if the fact-finding inquiry is legitimate, the president and Republicans must be entitled to try to demonstrate that Trump had proper motivations.

Contrary to Schiff’s deceptive claim at the start of the inquiry (in his “parody” version of the July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call), the president was not asking Ukraine to “make up dirt on my political opponent.” There was abundant good-faith reason to suspect self-dealing by the Bidens.

There is, similarly, a bounty of evidence of Ukrainian interference in the election. The president reasonably contends that his interests were not so much in the politics of 2020 as in accountability for election-meddling in 2016 – a matter Democrats purport to be interested in when the country at issue is Russia and the bottom line helps them politically.

More to the point, though, while Schiff claims that Biden corruption and Ukrainian election meddling have no relevance to the inquiry, he is not conducting the hearings that way. To the contrary, Democrats are raising these matters at will … with witnesses of their choosing, who have no relevant information.

Democrats then use the witnesses’ professions that they’ve heard nothing of Biden corruption or Ukrainian collusion as if it were evidence that these things did not happen.

In a legitimate proceeding, you can’t have it both ways.

Schiff is plainly hiding the ball when he claims the defense the president and Republicans want to pursue is irrelevant, but then asks safe (i.e., uninformed) witnesses about this defense in order to pretend that there is no evidence.

The chairman’s own conduct shows that the Bidens and the 2016 shenanigans of Ukrainian officials are germane to the inquiry and would be probative of why President Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate. If the inquiry is to be something other than a political stunt masquerading as serious impeachment business, Republicans must be permitted to present their side of the story.

“You’d think that there'd be a note of skepticism. You just wouldn’t think you’d see that kind of worship,” Hume told “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “We should expect from a journalist a kind of permanent state of skepticism in which we don’t become terribly enamored of people, while we may praise an official or a witness here or there.”

KEN STARR SAYS 'EXTRAVAGANT AND POLITICAL' IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS ARE NOT REVEALING A CRIME

""The hosannas that are being flung along with rose pedals at all these witnesses stem from the fact that many in media and in the Washington political world want Donald Trump gone and tend to applaud anything that tilts in that direction,” Hume added.

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, testified Tuesday that he was ""concerned"" by President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, adding: ""What I heard was inappropriate.""

WHAT IS BURISMA HOLDINGS? THE STORY BEHIND THE SCANDAL-TIED UKRAINE FIRM THAT HIRED HUNTER BIDEN

Jennifer Williams, an adviser to Vice President Pence, said she ""found the July 25 phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.”

House Democrats say Trump withheld $400 million in military aid until Zelensky's government agreed to open investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter and their activities involving Ukraine. Both Vindman and Williams testified Tuesday they never learned why the hold on the military aid to Ukraine was eventually lifted in September.

The underwhelming televised event prompted Lahren to hold a vote, of sorts, among panelists on Fox Nation's ""Democratic Debate Reactions,"" asking them which they found ""more boring"" -- the debate or the House-led impeachment hearings.

""That's a tough one for the American people,"" replied Fox News contributor and Fox Nation host David Webb, saying the debate was, ""a repeat of the last debate and the prior debate and probably will be the next debate on December 19th.

""I think that they weren't really debating each other,"" he observed. ""They weren't countering each other, making their arguments, for their part, from their position.""

One of the biggest topics on the debate stage last night was health care, but even on that major issue Fox News contributor and retired U.S. Marine and Johnny ""Joey"" Jones argued that the candidates did not seem to be setting themselves apart.

""The only difference between a moderate Democrat and a progressive is, 'Is this Medicare-for-all with the mandate or Medicare-for-all without?' That's about the only difference at this point,"" he said.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said that they would eliminate private health care insurance plans immediately to make way for a single-payer health care system. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have said that they would keep private insurance plans for now. The remaining candidates have advocated for keeping private insurance while expanding public health insurance options.

Erin Elmore, who is a republican strategist and attorney, observed that these positions may present a huge electoral challenge for Democrats.

""Let's say Elizabeth Warren does get this nomination, her Medicare-for-all is toxic in the general. Absolutely toxic. You can't campaign on that against President Trump. And that's the issue here. Can any of these people make it against President Trump? And they don't have that 'It' factor,"" she said.

Webb told the Fox Nation panel: ""Fact is when you take federal spending as a percentage of GDP to that level where you cross the 47 percent line and over the 50 plus percent line, as other socialist democracies, you are a socialist nation. And that's where their spending would take us.""

Jones observed: ""This is why impeachment is so important for them, because they're fighting over who's going to get the consolation prize.

""They're fighting over who's going to be there when the Democrats in Congress beat Trump up so much that they believe the voters won't show up for him,"" he concluded. ""That's the only way they can beat him... and when Trump gets another win and another win between now and November next year, the only hope they have is to impeach him on emotion.""

""Well actually that was the first question of the night,"" observed Lahren, who pointed out that MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow asked former vice president Joe Biden to weigh in on the impeachment hearings, without pressing him on his relation to the scandal.

Webb expressed disbelief that the debate moderators failed to ask Biden a single question about his and his son, Hunter's, dealings in Ukraine.

""You also have to look at his potential problems with influence peddling,"" said Webb, ""We're talking about major issues where his son was involved while he was vice president. He was a member of the Senate, a member of that body. I'm not convicting him. I want the inquiry and the investigation to include him, which would, therefore, if he's innocent, exclude him.""

“On the one hand, it featured a fantastic all-woman moderation team, and on the other, it was hosted by a media company with serious problems related to workplace sexual assault and harassment,” UltraViolet Action co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement to Fox News.

NBC MUST CLEAN UP ‘TOXIC CULTURE,’ 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DEMAND AHEAD OF MSNBC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

“This debate was also defined by what was not addressed: workplace sexual abuse, and the fact that MSNBC, and its parent company Comcast/NBC Universal, have a serious problem with silencing survivors, enabling abuse, and creating a culture of impunity where employees were simply unsafe,” Thomas added.

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At one point, former Vice President Joe Biden missed an opportunity to bring attention to the issue during MSNBC’s debate.

“The #MeToo movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take, early in your administration, to address this problem?” NBC News' White House correspondent Kristen Welker asked Biden, setting up the 2020 presidential hopeful to call for changes at the Peacock Network.

The former vice president, who was not among the five candidates to sign a harshly worded letter demanding parent company Comcast to “prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC,” had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network but ultimately went a different direction.

MATT LAUER, NBC’S ‘TOXIC CULTURE’ LOOM OVER MSNBC’S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said “the culture of how women are treated” needs to change before repeatedly saying we need to keep “punching” at domestic violence. He appeared to believe that the #MeToo movement is focused on domestic violence, as opposed to sexual assault and harassment.

“No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman, in anger, other than in self-defense… we have to just change the culture, period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it,” Biden said as he punched the air, drawing a snicker from the audience.

“No, I really mean it,” Biden said, apparently unaware of the irony that evoked the laughter.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Earlier this week, Tom Steyer, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its “toxic culture” after a series of sexual harassment scandals related to Weinstein and Lauer.

UltraViolet helped putting the letter together and said Biden was invited to partake but ultimately didn’t sign it.

NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim, refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct. UltraViolet’s letter called on parent company Comcast to step in and “conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at NBC.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

But the message apparently fell on deaf ears and Lack dodged the subject when approached by Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple backstage during the debate.

Wemple, who attended the debate and bumped into Lack backstage, said he assumed the NBC News boss would “want to express his confidence in NBC News’s efforts to date” or even blow off some steam.

“Not so fast,” Wemple wrote, adding that Lack quickly shut down questions about conducting an investigation.

“I don’t have anything to say about it. . . . I don’t know much about it,” Lack told Wemple.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC’s high-level executives doesn’t think the network will take action anytime soon.

“Andy Lack is the Rasputin of network news. He has [NBC Universal CEO Steve] Burke and [Comcast CEO] Roberts so wrapped around his finger that God himself couldn’t force an independent investigation — which Andy knows would certainly result in his ouster,” the insider told Fox News."

We believe the person, who is not technically a whistleblower, should be required to testify before the House Intelligence Committee. Democrats who control the committee disagree. They killed a motion to subpoena the so-called whistleblower, who has said through his attorney that he wants to remain anonymous.

Here’s why the person filing the complaint should testify:

FBI REACHED OUT TO WHISTLEBLOWER'S LEGAL TEAM FOR INTERVIEW, SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS

Impeaching and removing a president is perhaps the most consequential thing Congress can do, short of declaring war. Impeachment and removal turns our representative democracy on its head, nullifying the last election.

In the case of a first-term president, impeachment deprives the American people of the chance to pass judgment on his actions and decide if they want to reelect him.

Impeachment is designed to be a constitutional failsafe, a measure of last resort to save the republic from imminent harm posed by the executive.

Public understanding of such a grave step and confidence in its legitimacy demand that Democrats show that the impeachment proceedings now underway are more than simply an exercise of raw partisan politics.

The American people need to know as much as possible about what the president is accused of. Yet the impeachment inquiry against Trump has been marked by secret proceedings, rules favoring one party over the other, and explosive accusations by people who may not even have firsthand knowledge. These are not the marks of a legitimate process. Indeed, they actively undercut the people’s trust.

As then-Sen. Joe Biden said during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998: “We in Congress had better be very careful before we upset [the people’s] decision and make darn sure … that our decision to impeach him was based on principle and not politics.”

Biden, who went on to become vice president and is now seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump for the presidency next year, was right 21 years ago and his position is the right one today. Not surprisingly, Democrats are far more eager to impeach Republican Trump than they were to impeach Democrat Clinton.

As the House moves toward what appears to be Trump’s likely impeachment (followed by his likely acquittal in a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate), Democrats will need to gather all the facts and present them openly and honestly to the American people.

That means that the complainant needs to answer important questions like:

How did you learn about the Trump-Zelensky call?

Did you have any firsthand information?

Who provided you with second-hand information?

Why did you think this person or persons were trustworthy?

Did the accounts you heard from those sources differ from the memorandum of the call released by the president?

Many more questions need to be asked, of course.

The complainant’s attorneys have said he is willing to answer questions in writing, but that’s not sufficient. The American people need to weigh his credibility. Pieces of paper can’t answer questions.

And there are a lot of questions. As the intelligence community Inspector General noted, the complainant had significant ties to one of the current Democratic presidential candidates.

According to some media reports, the complainant is a registered Democrat who worked for then-Vice President Biden in addition to former CIA Director John Brennan and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice.

If any of these and other unverified reports about the so-called whistleblower are true, then there is good reason to think the complainant is more like a partisan double agent than a true whistleblower.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

And especially because it appears the complainant lacked firsthand knowledge of the events he complained about, there’s the question of who did. And why did they seek him out to pass their information along?

Motive matters. If impeachment is to be anything other than a partisan assault on our democracy, a bipartisan consensus must agree that politics was not the animating factor behind the complaint as well as the subsequent impeachment inquiry.

Current House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., had some good advice back in 1998, when he was already serving in the House.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

“There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment, when impeachment is supported by one of our major political parties and opposed by the other,” Nadler said 21 years ago. “Such an impeachment will produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come and will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions.”

Congress should heed that old but wise and very relevant advice of Joe Biden and Jerrold Nadler today.

While many expected the debate to focus attacks on the front runners – including the newly minted member of the club, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg – that didn’t happen.

However, Sen. Kamala Harris of California delivered a prosecutorial dissection of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that was the attack everyone will remember, after the latter criticized the Democratic Party and Harris brought the receipts that Gabbard was never really a member of it.

RISING BUTTIGIEG FENDS OFF ATTACKS, TAKES ON FAR-LEFT FLANK AT DEM DEBATE; BIDEN STUMBLES

Here are the night’s biggest winners and losers:

WINNERS

BIGGEST WINNER: Amy Klobuchar

Overall, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the winner of the contest than ran over two hours. She had her best performance by emphasizing her experience, productivity, electoral successes. She also emphasized the fact that women are judged by a different standard than men, citing her criticism of Buttigieg’s lack of experience while he was being hailed as a front-runner last week.

Klobuchar pulled it all together in Atlanta with a number of great points and lines -- many familiar -- but then she delivered the line of the night, ""If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."" Klobuchar isn’t a front runner and this debate won’t make her one. But, the senator will get another look from voters due to it and that puts her in a better position coming out of the debate than going into it.

SURPRISE WINNER: Joe Biden

Former Vice President Biden is a winner by default. Hiding in plain sight might be the best strategy for him. Biden didn’t have the mistake laden performance of past debates by receding for long stretches in the debate. Still holding on to a national lead, that strategy Wednesday night will help him hold on to it for a bit longer. Biden largely relied on his message that he can beat Trump, has the experience, and can bring people together. That might be enough, for now, to keep him in the post position but it’s not going to win the nomination without a better performance in future debates and on the campaign trail.

SURPRISE WINNER: Kamala Harris

Harris had her best performance in a long time. She went after Trump and Gabbard making the case against both in her best prosecutorial fashion. Harris may never match the electric moment she had when she went after Biden in an earlier debate, but she turned in her best performance since that one by mixing moxie and policy positions. That allows Harris to play for another day when she’s been skating at the edge of collapse. A lack of consistency has bedeviled her candidacy. But on Wednesday night she was the candidate everyone expected her to be in this campaign.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Tulsi Gabbard

Running to be the Democratic nominee and criticizing the Democratic Party is not a winning strategy. Gabbard’s criticism of the Party may have been her way of setting up a run as an independent in the general election. Instead, Harris disqualified her for both contests by reciting her embrace of Trump and dictators since the 2016 election. Gabbard then turned her aim on Buttigieg at the end of the debate in yet another curious attack on other Democratic candidates that has been a hallmark of her candidacy.

LOSER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg was the loser in Atlanta. He had the most to gain yet missed the opportunity to set himself apart from the front tier of candidates and generate even more of the momentum initiated by the latest polls. Buttigieg still struggles to address matters of race and that was no different on Wednesday night. The fact that Buttigieg couldn’t make the most of the debate on Wednesday night could foreshadow his ability to put the race away later in the campaign. It is his second turn in the spotlight and under the stage lights on Wednesday night he didn’t shine. Instead, Buttigieg turned in a serviceable appearance at best, missing an opportunity he’s unlikely to get again -- a hot hand going into a debate as a new front-runner.

LOSER: Elizabeth Warren

Debates have been Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bread and butter. No one has more plans, policies, or points and makes them better than Warren…but not on Wednesday night. For some reason, Warren didn’t have it. She made better points with more detail than any of the other candidates but her delivery and presence were off. A performance like those from her other debates would have helped Warren stem a tough week or two of poll numbers in early primary states. Instead, she will have to hit the trail to do it until the next debate.

LOSER: Bernie Sanders

The independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t do anything to help himself on Wednesday night. Same lines, same attacks, same Bernie Sanders. His performance means that Sanders won’t turn his drop in the polls around with the Atlanta debate. He has plenty of money to stay in the race for months to come. But, that doesn’t mean he’s going to win a contest in the process and that’s why debates like the one on Wednesday night matter.

LOSER: Cory Booker

In every debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has a moment…and that’s it. It’s just a moment. That’s not enough for him or his candidacy to make a move. Booker’s performance Wednesday night isn’t going to move the polls for him and it’s unlikely he is going do anything else at this point that will do it.

LOSERS: Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang

Neither entrepreneur Andrew Yang nor billionaire activist Tom Steyer were able to make a real mark in this debate to make a move in the polls with voters. Steyer resorted to reciting lines from his TV ads during much of the debate. Yang had a few good lines. But, at this point, that’s a costly missed opportunity for both candidates.

LOSER: Deval Patrick

The late entrant into the 2020 Democratic race, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick not only didn’t make the debate stage he also canceled an event he organized at Morehouse College in Atlanta, the site of the debate, when only two people showed up."

And the scandal, which fundamentally involved inappropriate behavior by a much older man, came to be known by the name of the young victim rather than the victimizer.

DEROY MURDOCK: IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, DEMOCRATS IGNORE UKRAINIAN DENIALS OF PRESSURE BY TRUMP

Years later, I worked in Democratic politics for then-Sen. Barack Obama in his campaign for president. It was so clear to me how wrong President Clinton’s actions had been – and equally how much partisanship polluted the moment.

Working with young Democrats on a hope-filled presidential campaign, and then in the White House for President Obama, I understood that a married leader having an affair with his or her 20-something intern was unacceptable. A situation like that involves an abuse of power. And no one – especially not the president of the United States – should engage in that type of misbehavior.

It can make you uncomfortable among Democrats, in a party dominated by the Clinton family for so long, to acknowledge this fundamental truth. But wanting your “team” to win shouldn’t shift your fundamental beliefs in morality and right and wrong.

I wonder about Republicans. How many of them have partisan blinders up, as many Democrats did, 21 years ago? Will any of them who are clearly uncomfortable with President Trump’s behavior stand up against what I and millions of other Americans see as his abuse of power?

Today I’m watching with a new lens as the impeachment hearings for President Trump unfold. I am now a mother with a young son and a former White House staffer. I saw the power of the presidency up close and I understand the gravity of every decision the leader in that office makes.

I wonder about Republicans. How many of them have partisan blinders up, as many Democrats did, 21 years ago? Will any of them who are clearly uncomfortable with President Trump’s behavior stand up against what I and millions of other Americans see as his abuse of power?

If you look at President Trump as objectively as possible, without political bias, you’ll see that it’s been clearly established that he paid two women for their silence about their claims that they had extramarital affairs with him – though Trump denies any sexual relationship with either woman.

Hearing Trump’s denials reminded me of President Clinton famous statement – “I did not have sexual relations with that woman” – before he was impeached in the House but acquitted in the Senate and allowed to remain in office. That will likely turn out to be Trump’s fate as well.

Take a closer look and you’ll also see that six former employees and associates of President Trump – who purports to support law and order – have been convicted of felonies since he took office. And you’ll see that Special Counsel Robert Mueller didn’t clear Trump of accusations of obstruction of justice – Mueller simply reached no conclusion because a sitting president can’t be indicted under Justice Department policy.

And now comes the Ukraine scandal, where – in my opinion and the opinion of many others – President Trump illegally pressured the president of Ukraine and withheld nearly $400 million in vital assistance to Ukraine for his own political benefit.

Trump clearly wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden – Trump’s potential opponent his the 2020 presidential election. Trump also wanted Ukraine to investigate a baseless claim that Ukraine interfered in our 2016 presidential election on behalf of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

All that’s at issue is whether Trump demanded these actions by Zelensky in return for U.S. aid to defend against Russian military aggression, or whether Trump just said it would be nice if Zelensky did these things as “a favor.”

Incredibly, Trump told reporters at the White House just recently that he still wants Ukraine to conduct an investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and also wants China to investigate Hunter Biden for his business dealings. Despite his many denials, it’s obvious to me and many others that this amounts to Trump inviting Ukraine and China to interfere in our 2020 election.

But so many Republicans keep defending Trump, trying to justify actions I consider unjustifiable.

President Trump is a showman. He knows how to control a camera and how to stir partisan passions.

Just as President Clinton did in the 1990s, President Trump controls the biggest bully pulpit in the land. Republican elected officials and candidates for elected office know their chances of winning elections often depend on a presidential endorsement. But I also believe that many of them have a feeling about Trump like I had about President Clinton during his sex scandal: what the president did was wrong.

President Trump prioritized himself over our national security – willingly endangering our ally Ukraine for his own political benefit. This is why the House is considering impeaching him.

Sometimes our partisan goggles get in the way when elected officials engage in all sorts of misconduct, including illegal activity, as well as what we should all agree are violations of moral and ethical standards.

These partisan goggles cloud our judgement and get us to excuse the inexcusable. Years later, that clouded judgement doesn’t look so good anymore.

President Trump continues to undermine our national security, endangering us all. The dangerous path he treads might seem amusing to some. But his disdain for our allies, his disrespect for our own national security officials and diplomats, and his pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent and his son are unacceptable conduct for any president, regardless of political party.

Sondland wi… [+12028 chars]","Gordon Sondland, the most anticipated witness in the impeachment inquiry, will testify on Wednesday -- but it remains unclear whether he'll pose problems for Democrats, Republicans, or all of the above.",2019-11-20,Fox News,'The Gordon Problem' set to testify in impeachment inquiry's main event,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/the-gordon-problem-set-to-take-the-stand-in-impeachment-inquirys-main-event,"In a conspicuous moment during Tuesday's impeachment inquiry hearings, former National Security Council aide Tim Morrison testified that one of his colleagues urgently warned him about President Trump’s European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, and even coined a name for her concerns: “the Gordon problem.”

On Wednesday morning, it'll be Sondland's turn to testify as the impeachment probe's most anticipated witness, less than 24 hours after Republicans declared total victory in Tuesday afternoon's hearings. But it remained unclear whether the wealthy hotelier-turned-diplomat would pose a ""problem"" for Democrats, Republicans, or all of the above.

Sondland is more directly entangled than any witness yet in the president’s alleged efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's dealings in the country, including Biden's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid. Yet Sondland has already amended his testimony once -- “I now do recall,” he said, talking to Ukraine about anti-corruption investigations — and has frustrated Democrats' efforts to build a consistent narrative of misconduct by the president.

Most notably, Sondland previously testified behind closed doors that Trump directly told him there were to be ""no quid pro quos of any kind"" with Ukraine, and that he didn’t recall any conversations with the White House about withholding military assistance in return for Ukraine helping with the president’s political campaign.

Then, William Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires for Ukraine, told lawmakers that Sondland himself said ""everything"" — a White House visit for Ukraine's new leader and the release of military aid to the former Soviet republic — was contingent on a public announcement of investigations into the 2016 election and into Ukraine gas company Burisma Holdings. (Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board of Burisma, despite having little relevant experience, while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president.)

Weeks later, after testimony from Taylor and Morrison placed him at the center of key discussions, Sondland amended his testimony and claimed his recollection had been ""refreshed."" Sondland said he now could recall a September conversation in which he told an aide to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that military aid likely would not occur until Ukraine made public announcements about corruption investigations. Sondland said he came to ""understand"" that arrangement from other sources.

Additionally, Sondland has insisted he knew acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney only well enough to wave and say hello. He said he may have spoken to him once or twice on the phone, but not about Ukraine. Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an NSC official, has testified Sondland cited a discussion with Mulvaney when pushing Ukrainian officials to open the investigations that Trump wanted into alleged 2016 U.S. presidential election interference and the Bidens.

MORRISON, VOLKER UNDERCUT DEMS' CLAIMS OF BRIBERY, AS GOP DECLARES VICTORY: 'A GREAT DAY FOR THE PRESIDENT'

Separately, Fiona Hill, another White House national security official, said Sondland often talked of meetings with Mulvaney. In a further link between the two men, she quoted the-then National Security Adviser John Bolton as telling her he didn’t want to be part of “whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney were cooking up.” Hill is to testify Thursday.

Trump, meanwhile, has recently tried to suggest that he barely knows his hand-picked ambassador, but Sondland has said he has spoken several times with the president and was acting on his direction. Sondland routinely bragged about his proximity to Trump and drew alarm from the foreign service and national security apparatus as part of an irregular channel of diplomacy led by the president’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

Last week, State Department official David Holmes revealed one of Sondland's interactions with Trump, saying he recalled it “vividly.”

The political counselor was having lunch with Sondland in Kiev when the ambassador dialed up the president on his cell phone and Holmes could hear Trump’s voice.

“I then heard President Trump ask, quote, ‘So he’s going to do the investigation?’” Holmes testified. “Ambassador Sondland replied that ‘He’s going to do it,’ adding that President Zelensky will, quote, ‘do anything you ask him to.’”

Holmes testified that he told ""a number of friends of mine"" about the call because it was ""like, a really extraordinary thing"" to be ""part of"" a lunch in which ""someone called the president."" He insisted he didn't go into detail about the call while he boasted about it, but estimated that he may have told as many as six friends.

Sondland was known for telling others ""he was in charge of Ukraine"" despite being the U.S. envoy in Brussels, Hill testified. (Trump campaign officials have noted that several Democrat witnesses appeared to suggest that they were in charge of Ukraine policy, not the president.)

""And I asked, well, on whose authority?” said Hill. ""And he said, the president.""

Also testifying on Wednesday are Pentagon official Laura Cooper and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Hale.

Their appearances will follow the testimony Tuesday of four national security and diplomatic officials, including two GOP witnesses -- Morrison and former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker -- who largely undercut Democrats' primary arguments for impeachment.

Both Volker and Morrison repeatedly denied that there was any bribery or extortion by the president in his call with Zelensky. Their answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats as their impeachment inquiry continued into its second week of public hearings: With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years.

""Ambassador Volker, I presume you got a readout of the call,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y, asked at one point. ""Was there any reference to withholding aid? Any reference to bribery? Any reference to quid pro quo? Any reference to extortion?""

""No, there was not,"" Volker replied, again and again.

Shortly after that moment, President Trump tweeted, ""A great day for Republicans, a great day for our Country!""

""Kind of hard to prove a corrupt quid pro quo theory when the key U.S. policy people, plus the Ukrainians, were never aware of such an arrangement,"" Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw added late Tuesday, noting that Ukraine's president has said he felt no pressure from Trump to open any probes. ""Can we go back to governing now, that’d be great thanks.""

Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan told Fox News, ""This was a very good day for Republicans, for our president.""

However, Volker did help some aspects of House Democrats' case. He shifted his own account of a July 10 White House meeting to say Sondland did, in fact, discuss investigations with the visiting Ukrainians. “I think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,” Volker said.

Volker said Sondland had raised the idea of investigations “in a generic way,"" and that Bolton immediately ended the meeting.

A series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and other leaders in which they discussed a need for Ukraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma Holdings. Volker also said he didn't initially realize the connection between a Trump-sought investigation of Burisma and the Bidens,

Volker went on to testify that during a September dinner with top Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak, he’d discouraged Ukraine from trying to prosecute the country’s previous president. Volker says he warned it would sow deep societal divisions.

Volker said Yermak quipped in response, “You mean like asking us to investigate Clinton and Biden?” Volker claimed he didn’t “quite understand” the head-turning remark and was “kind of puzzled” by it.

Burisma had been under investigation before then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in charge. In his call with Zelensky, Trump suggested the Ukrainians look into the circumstances of the prosecutor's termination, including Joe Biden's boast that he had the prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in critical aid.

Another witness who testified earlier Tuesday was a career Army officer who described Trump’s call with Zelensky as “improper.”

""Frankly, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing,"" he testified. ""In certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out.""

Vindman told lawmakers it was his “duty” to report his concerns about the call, as he deflected Republican attacks, including from the White House on his loyalty and career in public service.

OPINION: VINDMAN NEEDS TO BE FIRED, AFTER TESTIMONY REVEALS HIS INSUBORDINATION AND ALLEGED PROPENSITY FOR LEAKS

It wasn’t the first time Vindman had registered his concerns over Ukraine policy. He testified about the July 10 meeting at the White House when Sondland told visiting Ukraine officials they would need to “deliver” before the administration would agree to a meeting Zelenskiy wanted with Trump.

“Ambassador Sondland referred to investigations into the Bidens and Burisma in 2016,” Vindman testified.

However, Vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by Republican Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Vindman testified earlier in the day that he did not discuss his concerns about Trump's July phone call with Morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable.

Under questioning from Wenstrup, Morrison confirmed that Vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that Vindman testified Morrison was unreachable.

Arizona GOP Rep. Paul Gosar offered a blunt assessment of Vindman's testimony, tweeting: ""I think people need a reminder: the democrats said they would impeach starting in December 2016–before @realDonaldTrump was even sworn in. This is a hearing looking for a reason. It’s corrupt and immoral. The dude in the uniform is a seditionist.""

Morrison, meanwhile, also said he had heard others express concern that Vindman was a leaker, and could not be trusted with key information. Asked about that allegation, Vindman read from a glowing performance review that described him as an exemplary officer.

In a particularly remarkable moment, Vindman testified that he was asked to serve as Ukraine’s defense minister three times -- but repeatedly denied the offers -- when he traveled to Kiev for the inauguration of Ukraine's president. Oleksander Danylyuk, the former Chairman of the National Security and Defence Council in Ukraine, reportedly said on Tuesday the offer was ""clearly a joke.""

At the White House, Trump said he had watched part of the day’s testimony and slammed the ongoing impeachment hearings as a “disgrace.” Over the weekend, Trump assailed Vice President Pence aide Jennifer Williams as part of the “Never Trumpers” who oppose his presidency, though there is no indication she has shown any partisanship. Williams was critical of Trump's call with Zelensky.

However, in his testimony, Morrison suggested the impeachment brouhaha was predictable partisan politics as usual.

""I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate,"" Morrison said in his opening statement on Tuesday. ""My fears have been realized.""

While discussing the details of the call, which was previously described by another official, Sondland spoke to the casual nature of his communications with the president. The moment in question concerned his assurance to Trump that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""loves"" him.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS: LIVE UPDATES FROM DAY FOUR

""[Holmes] also testified that you confirmed to President Trump that you were in Ukraine at the time and that President Zelensky, quote, 'loves your ass,' unquote,"" Goldman stated. ""Do you recall saying that?""

""Yeah, sounds like something I would say,"" Sondland responded, drawing laughs from those in attendance. ""That's how President Trump and I communicate. A lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter.""

Sondland later explained that this was his way of letting Trump know that Zelensky was very amicable in a meeting Sondland had recently had with the Ukrainian leader.

""He was just very willing to work with the United States, and was being very amicable, and so putting it in Trump-speak by saying he loves your ass, he'll do whatever you want, and that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.""

Others have said that the two of them specifically discussed investigations on that call, apparently referring to Trump's desire for politically advantageous probes from Kiev.

Sondland's testimony began the fourth day of public hearings in the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry of Trump, which thus far has centered on whether or not Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic activities in 2016 as well as former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while the elder Biden was in office.

Sondland testified that it was his impression that Trump would not meet with Zelensky at the White House unless Zelensky publicly declared that he was conducting investigations of the Democrats and Burisma. Democrats have accused Trump of also withholding military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get the investigations. Sondland said he never directly heard from Trump that this was the case, although he did say he never got a clear answer as to why the aid was held back and presumed they were linked.

Sondland did recall that at one point he asked Trump what he wants from Ukraine.

""He just said, 'I want nothing, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo,'"" Sondland recalled.

“What they’re really saying to voters is you can’t actually make changes to American policy, the ones that we support,” said the host of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

Carlson went on to explain that the removal of Trump from the White House would preserve the status quo, which he said enriches ""private equity managers, defense contractors, and parasites of the vast federal bureaucracy.”

Carlson spoke after the fourth day of impeachment hearings by the House Intelligence Committee, which featured testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.

However, Sondland also testified that he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine during a phone conversation Sept. 9, to which Trump responded: ""I want nothing. I want nothing.

“From the beginning, Washington has had presumptions about what the new president was like, about what policy voters were allowed to choose,” Carlson said. “Voters weren’t allowed to end foreign wars by casting a ballot or put America first or to secure America’s borders.

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,"" Obama said. He said Americans ""like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.""

It seems clear that President Obama was directing his comments at the two farthest-left major Democratic presidential candidates – Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont – as well as the four freshmen congresswomen collectively known as “the Squad.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON’T WANT TO ‘TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM’

Obama is right. We had an American Revolution in 1776 that changed history for the better and gave birth to our great nation. But many Americans are alarmed by talk of a second revolution that will move America so far left that millions of people will feel left out.

Americans want sound solutions – not simply solutions that sound good – that will make major improvements to our country. But they want the equivalent of a home remodeling for our nation’s government – not a demolition that will blow up what works as well as what needs replacing.

You can be sure that President Trump will work to demonize whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him next year. Trump will call his opponent a wild-eyed socialist who will raise taxes sky-high on everyone, impose crazy new regulations, destroy our economy and take away our freedoms. Democrats need to nominate someone who can show such Trump claims are nonsense, and can appeal to centrist voters as well as those on the far left.

The polls back up Obama’s advice for Democrats to avoid extremism.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is surging in the polls in the nomination race because he is seen as progressive but not radical by many voters. The 37-year-old military veteran is seen as the future of the Democratic Party by many – and if he doesn’t get the nomination next year has plenty of time to compete in the years ahead.

Buttigieg has taken sizeable leads over the other top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders – in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first two nominating contests will be held in February. A lot can change between now the first votes, but Mayor Pete is clearly a strong contender.

Like Biden and many of the second-tier candidates, Buttigieg is taking the path recommended by Obama – seeking evolution rather than revolution.

While the revolutionary faction of the Democratic Party wants ""Medicare-for-all,"" Buttigieg favors Medicare “for all who want it.” Under this plan, people who want to keep their employer-provided health insurance can do so. But an affordable, comprehensive public alternative for health insurance would be available for all who want it.

When it comes to guns, Mayor Pete supports a voluntary gun buyback program that voters have voiced strong support for. He rejects mandatory confiscation of assault weapons, like the plan proposed by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas. That idea was so unpopular it may have contributed to O’Rourke’s decision to end his presidential candidacy not long after he proposed it.

On the issue of immigration, Buttigieg again sides with the majority of voters. He wants citizenship for Dreamers – immigrants brought to the U.S. without legal authorization as children. About 77 percent of voters favor this sensible plan

At the same time, Buttigieg wants to enforce our immigration laws, but with less severe penalties and without separating immigrant children from their parents. And the mayor rejects calls from some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. He understands our immigration problems are being caused by the wrong policies, not by the people who enforce those policies.

Like Biden and some candidates in the back of the pack of Democratic contenders, Buttigieg wants to fix what’s broken in our country and unite us around our common goals and aspirations – the exact opposite of what President Trump has tried to do by fanning the flames of division and spewing hateful rhetoric in his speeches and tweets.

Not too long ago, “experts” thought a black presidential candidate couldn’t be elected until the far future. Barack Obama waged a brilliant presidential campaign and proved them wrong, and then won reelection against all odds. So he has the best credentials of anyone to know what Democrats need to do to send Trump into a well-deserved political retirement.

There are no silver medals for the second-place finishers in presidential elections. The losing candidate can write a book about what might have been, but can’t accomplish anything for the American people. All his or her brilliant plans will amount to nothing.

Democrats need to focus on the need to defeat President Trump as their top priority. To do this they have to nominate a pragmatic candidate who can appeal to moderate Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans turned off by Trump’s conduct in office.

Democratic candidates need to remember that Obama got to the White House by calling for change – not revolution.

He says he's ready.

“We are making sure we are ready for anything that will come,” the South Bend, Ind., mayor said when asked on Monday how he was preparing for the fifth-round debate in Atlanta.

Once the longest of long-shot hopefuls, he's now firmly in the top tier of candidates, thanks to a recent surge in polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that kick off the nominating calendar.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, expects Buttigieg “to be one of the big storylines” coming out of the debate.

“In every single debate so far, the person who came in as the front-runner or with momentum has faced serious incoming,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

“In each one of them, the person in the crosshairs stumbled,” he emphasized. “And so the question for Buttigieg is, now that he’s that guy, how does he handle the incoming?”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

The 37-year-old candidate is the youngest in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls – and Tran spotlighted the “generational contrast” between Buttigieg and the other top-tier contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are all in their 70’s.

“Look to the upcoming debate to see the top tier of candidates try to turn his youth and fresh take into a vulnerability,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The debate also comes as Buttigieg faces increased media attention for his lack of support in polling among black voters, who make up around 20 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate.

The debate’s being held in Georgia's largest city and capital – which is home to a large and vibrant African-American community. Elleithee said Buttigieg “has got to begin show soon that he can get some traction with black voters and this is a good opportunity for him to do that.”

“He would do himself a lot of good to come out tonight and find some way to connect with black voters in a real way,” he suggested.

Tran looked to the candidate’s numerous policy proposals, saying that Buttigieg’s “newly minted status at the top of the polls in Iowa also offers an opportunity for the mayor to discuss his expansive ideas about how to govern the nation.”

Buttigieg likely won’t be the only candidate with a mark on his or her back.

“I suspect that Warren’s going to be the other main target of attacks tonight,” Elleithee predicted. “Her Medicare-for-all plan has proven to be a major target. So she’s going to continue to be pushed on it. In the last debate, she was pushed on it. She stumbled. She then came out with details and now those details are going to be fair game.”

Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were the two candidates who took on Warren over her government-run single-payer health care proposal at last month’s debate.

And Elleithee said “if there’s going to be any real fireworks tonight, I think the thing to look for will be Buttigieg versus Warren on this issue. They have both emerged as sort of the standard-bearers of the two sides of the Medicare-for-all debate, that has sort of become a proxy issue for this bigger discussion about the direction of the Democratic Party. “

But Tran said Warren should be able to take the heat.

“I expect Senator Warren will continue to take swings from others on stage around the costs of her health care proposal — but if the previous debate matchups are any indicator of how she will respond, I don’t see her being ruffled by the attention,” she predicated.

As he has at every debate to date, Biden will also be in the spotlight. Although he’ll likely not face the scrutiny he weathered in the first three debates – when he was the unrivaled front-runner – Elleithee stressed that “Biden’s going to need to have a good night. He’s still in good shape but he’s slipped a bit in the early states. He’s got to stop the slide.”

And Tran noted that “as before, voters will have their eyes on Vice President Joe Biden to see how he manages questions about his experience — the good and the bad — and his reaction to the impeachment hearings currently underway.”

Tran also highlighted that she’s going to “be on the lookout” on whether Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang have breakout moments.

“Both have delivered strong performances in the past rounds of debates, albeit without surging in the polls as a result. But they both bring unique perspectives to the stage and it’s not too late to shift the dynamics heading into Iowa,” she explained.

Elleithee’s got his eye on Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a one-time top tier contender who’s seen her White House bid plummet this autumn.

“She’s got to see if she can claw her way back in,” he said.

And he pointed to Klobuchar, “who keeps having steady debate performances that haven’t translated into significant support in the polls. She’s inched up a little bit. She had a very good debate performance last time. Can she replicate that and this time turn it into some sort of real bump in support.”

280,Gregg Re,"Elizabeth Warren unloaded on U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland just hours after his explosive impeachment testimony, saying at Wednesday night's Democratic presidential primary debate that he bought his position ""by writing a check for $1 … [+7105 chars]","Pete Buttigieg’s dramatic rise from little-known Indiana mayor to a leading Democratic presidential candidate faces its toughest test on Wednesday, with rivals poised to lob debate-stage attacks in an effort to stall his momentum.",2019-11-21,Fox News,"Impeachment takes center stage at Dem debate, as Warren takes aim at star witness Gordon Sondland",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-likely-to-face-attacks-from-all-sides-as-dems-meet-for-debate-amid-impeachment,"Pete Buttigieg, whose popularity has surged in recent days, found himself the sudden target of attacks at Wednesday night's fifth Democratic primary debate but sought to stay on the offensive and make an appeal to the country's political middle with a blunt rebuke of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders' ""Medicare-for-all"" plan.

He was joined by several other candidates on stage in going after the health care overhaul, putting the party's far-left candidates on their heels over what Buttigieg called their ""divisive"" and unrealistic approach.

Reflecting the ever-shifting dynamic in the race, meanwhile, Joe Biden had a mixed performance -- projecting foreign policy strength and siding with Buttigieg against the liberal wing on health care, while also suffering some stumbles on the debate stage. Until recently the unrivaled front-runner in the race, Biden competed for attention Wednesday with three other top-tier candidates -- Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg -- but flubbed when he erroneously stated in front of Sen. Kamala Harris that he had the support of the ""only"" black woman elected to the Senate.

In an odd moment, he also said it's important to ""keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, noting that it's ""rarely"" needed for men to hit women in self-defense.

The debate was the candidates' first meeting since Warren said she would gradually guide the nation toward Medicare-for-all, supposedly paid for with a host of tax hikes on the rich and other measures. One by one, several of the candidates -- including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- raised objections to that plan.

""I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said at one point.

Buttigieg called for health care reform ""without the divisive step of ordering people onto it,"" saying that ""commanding people to accept that option"" is not the right approach.

""We have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize, not polarize, that majority,"" the South Bend mayor said.

And, in a particularly spirited moment, New Jersey Sen. Booker directly took on Warren's proposed wealth tax, saying it would be ineffective as a means of funding her Medicare-for-all plan, along with her proposals to provide free college tuition and erasing student loan debt.

Democrats need to be focused on growing wealth, Booker said, not simply taxing it. Republicans have asserted that, even if all billionaires were somehow taxed out of existence without causing any capital markets distortion, the resulting revenues in the best case scenario would barely pay for three years of Medicare-for-all. (The world's 2,150 billionaires have an approximate combined net worth of $8.7 trillion, and the progressive Urban Institute has said that Medicare-for-all would cost on average $10.2 trillion for three years.)

WHAT HAPPENED IN TODAY'S BLOCKBUSTER IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY?

Vermont Sen. Sanders, who is arguing for a more immediate shift to a single-payer system, separately sparred with Biden on the issue. Biden argued that Medicare-for-all could not pass Congress, in part because it would force people to lose their private insurance.

""I trust the American people to make a judgment about what is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies want,"" Biden said. He continued to push for modifications to Obama-era health care reforms instead.

On foreign policy, Biden sounded an authoritative note, declaring that he would restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We have to speak loudly on violations of human rights,"" he said, unequivocally holding Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman responsible for Khashoggi's death.

Later, in a somewhat awkward moment, Biden prompted some laughter in the audience when he declared that ""we gotta keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, and that it is only acceptable to hit a woman in ""self-defense,"" which he said would ""rarely"" occur.

And, Biden asserted that he had the support of ""the only African-American woman who’s ever been elected to the United States Senate"" -- prompting Booker and Harris to dryly remark, ""That's not true.""

Harris noted, “The other one is here.” Biden later corrected himself to say he had the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, referring to former Illinois Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley Braun.

In another notable one-on-one moment, Sanders, touting the benefits of socialism in a discussion with billionaire Tom Steyer, argued that America only has ""eight or nine"" years left to reverse catastrophic effects of climate change, including cities going ""underwater."" United Nations experts made similar claims all the way back in 1989.

As the heated discussion unfolded at the MSNBC debate in Atlanta, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- who was recently accused by Hillary Clinton of being a ""Russian asset"" -- offered a blunt assessment: ""Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,"" she said.

Gabbard also doubled down on earlier comments that Clinton represents the “personification of the rot in the Democratic Party.” She said the party is influenced by a “foreign policy establishment” that supports regime-change wars. She called it the “Bush, Clinton, Trump foreign policy doctrine.” (Harris then attacked Gabbard for appearing on Fox News.)

Separately, Gabbard unloaded on Buttigieg after he attacked her for a widely-panned meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of war crimes.

""You would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends,"" Gabbard shot back, noting that former President John F. Kennedy met with his counterpart in the Soviet Union.

Klobuchar also pointedly criticized Buttigieg, arguing that he ""said the right words"" as a ""local official"" but lacks needed experience.

""I actually have the experience,"" Klobuchar remarked.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" Buttigieg retorted. ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Meanwhile, Warren unloaded on U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland just hours after his explosive impeachment hearing testimony, saying at Wednesday night's primary debate that he bought his position ""by writing a check for $1 million"" to Trump's inaugural committee.

Warren vowed that if she were elected, ""We are not going to give the ambassador posts to the highest bidder"" -- signaling that the Massachusetts Democratic senator would use the proceedings to advance her outsider message.

However, The Washington Free Beacon noted that Warren repeatedly voted to confirm several of former President Barack Obama's donors to ambassadorships, even when they lacked relevant experience. And, Warren did not object to Sonland's confirmation at the time.

""Read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that show how the president tried to obstruct justice,"" Warren said. ""We have to establish the principle that no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.""

Others on stage also slammed President Trump over the impeachment proceedings.

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris, D-Calif., declared. Citing Sondland's claim that everyone was ""in the loop"" on Ukraine talks at the heart of the probe, she said ""that means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president"" and other top officials.

Not everyone on stage committed to voting to convict the president if he were impeached, however. Klobuchar suggested she wanted Trump removed, but emphasized the importance of seeing all the evidence.

""I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct. ... I just believe our jurors is to look at each count and make a decision,"" Klobuchar said, before saying that Trump repeatedly ""puts his own private interests ... in front of our country's interest.""

The debate's initial attention on Trump and Medicare-for-all took some heat off Buttigieg, at least for the debate's beginning moments. His dramatic rise from little-known Indiana mayor to a leading Democratic presidential candidate faced its toughest test on Wednesday, with rivals eager to stall his momentum.

Harris and Buttigieg engaged in a tense but respectful conversation later on in the evening, as Harris discussed the importance of not taking ""women of color"" for granted.

""I do sometimes feel like a stranger in my own country,"" Buttigieg, who is openly gay, remarked.

The debate in Atlanta marked the first time Buttigieg faced other White House hopefuls as an undisputed member of the top tier.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The 37-year old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, gained significant ground in recent months in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February. He is bunched at the top of most polls in Iowa with candidates who have much longer political resumes.

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

Some surveys are beginning to show him taking a more convincing lead in the race, at least in early-voting states.

Buttigieg still faces plenty of hurdles to clinching the Democratic nomination, particularly winning over black and other minority voters. But his Iowa rise means he could come under fire from his rivals like never before.

Biden, Warren and Sanders have all faced similar scrutiny in previous debates, and those attacks did little to change the trajectory of the race.

The debate unfolded at a moment of uncertainty about the Democratic field, with some in the party, particularly donors, worried there’s no one positioned to defeat President Trump. Former President Barack Obama took the unusual step last week of warning the party against moving too far to the left.

Speaking to that anxiety, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the Democratic race last week. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is openly flirting with a bid.

Neither Patrick nor Bloomberg were onstage Wednesday.

With less than three months before voting, much of the nation’s political attention would typically be focused on the primary. Instead, the focus is on the impeachment inquiry against Trump.

Booker faces especially intense pressure. He’s yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling requirements for the December debate, and his campaign acknowledges that he needs to capitalize on the national spotlight.

The New Jersey senator took an apparent shot at Buttigieg at one point, following the news that his campaign had used a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently had nothing to do with the campaign.

“I want to turn back to the issue of black voters,"" Booker said. ""I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.""

In his rousing closing statement Wednesday night, Booker claimed to throw out his prepared remarks to discuss the ""debt"" that all Americans owed because of the country's racist history.

""It is time to fight, and fight together,"" Booker said, as the audience applauded.

Gabbard, for her closing remarks, urged Democrats to defeat the ""divisiveness of Donald Trump"" and ""make Dr. King's dream a reality.""

In his closing statement, Buttigieg offered an olive branch to ""progressives,"" as well as ""moderates"" and ""a lot of future former Republicans,"" emphasizing his efforts to win over moderates throughout the contentious evening.

""I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building,"" Buttigieg remarked.

After the candidates left the stage, progressive author and Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson -- who didn't qualify for Wednesday's debate -- tweeted simply, ""Miss me?

""My assessment of the evidence [thus] far? Nowhere close. The evidence is conflicting and ambiguous,"" he told Hemmer.

Starr said that European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland's testimony Wednesday falls into the same category since Sondland gave conflicting information about whether President Trump sought a quid pro quo with Ukraine involving military aid and an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

""Clearly in his opening statement, a quid pro quo. And then, he says later, 'Well, the president said, 'I don't want anything. Right? President Zelensky should just do the right thing.' [Those are] the words from the president himself,"" he continued.

""So, the record at the end of the day is likely to be ambiguous at best, conflicting at best ... and you shouldn't charge and you cannot convict a sitting president on the basis of conflicting and ambiguous evidence and destabilize the American government,"" Starr argued.

He told Hemmer that the entire impeachment inquiry is ""so terrible for the country."" Hemmer cited a Democratic lawmaker who told him he wants the hearings to end and for Congress to issue a censure to Trump over his behavior.

""During the Clinton years and during the Clinton impeachment, voices such as Dianne Feinstein -- she's still in the Senate -- said, 'This is serious...misconduct, but do we really want to remove a sitting president from office? Let's censure him,'"" Starr pointed out.

""So, at least, I hope the Democrats will have that conversation about we don't like the way foreign policy was conducted here, the delay [in providing aid] and so forth. That's debatable, but it is not the stuff of impeachment,"" he told Hemmer.

Later in the morning, after hearing testimony from David Holmes, a U.S. State Department official in Ukraine, and former National Security Council aide Fiona Hill, Starr said he does not believe a ""corrupt bargain"" by Trump is being proven.

Starr said Hill's testimony about Russian interference in the 2016 election was ""eloquent,"" particularly about the Kremlin trying to ""sow seeds of discord"" on both sides. He said it's ""willful blindness"" for the president's critics to dismiss allegations that Ukrainian officials were supporting Hillary Clinton."

She is both a genuine heroine and an example of how our system is failing us.

Ambassador Yovanovitch sat tall before the committee last week, looking directly at those who were questioning her as she answered them without hesitation. No matter how she was attacked, how her service for our country was minimized by some (including by President Trump in a tweet), she remained unruffled.

In a soft and steady voice, Yovanovitch focused on the facts. No one on the committee, try as they might, could get her to take a cheap shot or make an unkind remark.

LEGAL ANALYSTS REACT TO MARIE YOVANOVITCH'S TESTIMONY, AGREE DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A LEG TO STAND ON

I could see when she was shocked or upset only when she raised one carefully groomed eyebrow. That was it! As someone who has been known to hit back pretty hard, I was in awe of her cool in the face of so much heat being thrown in her direction.

As Yovanovitch spoke and told her story, the whole world saw a good person and a thorough professional – someone humble, smart, dedicated and firm in her values.

Her story is an immigrant’s American Dream. Her parents fled communist Russia to Canada, where she was born. When she was just a toddler, they moved to the United States.

Right out of Princeton, Yovanovitch was hired by the U.S. State Department and has served honorably under six administrations – four Republican and two Democratic. She moved steadily up the hierarchy at the department and won awards in many of the places she served.

People often think of serving in an embassy is a non-stop party, constantly hosting leaders, business executives and civic groups to advance our national interest and demonstrate the joy of the American way of life. Yovanovitch was not always in a post where it was wise to party.

How Yovanovitch was treated showed how easily corrupt people can undermine our nonpartisan Foreign Service by convincing career politicians to spread disinformation about an ambassador.

In the 33 years she served, Yovanovitch moved 13 times – including five times to hardship posts like Somalia, the world’s “most failed state” by some estimations, a place riddled with corruption and torn by civil war.

She served in Russia during an attempted coup where she was literally caught in the crossfire. She needed to get to the embassy while there was gunfire in the streets. She had to try three times to get to her car, dodging bullets without the benefit of body armor or even a helmet.

That was the steel I saw in her spine as I watched her testify. Yovanovitch’s posture is that of a woman who has faced down bullets to live her values.

As she said about her parents in her opening testimony: “Their personal history – my personal history – gave me both great gratitude to the United States and great empathy for others – like the Ukrainian people – who want to be free.”

It was her commitment to keep her oath to support and defend the Constitution that got Yovanovitch removed as our ambassador to Ukraine – ordered back to the U.S. suddenly despite her outstanding performance as ambassador.

Yovanovitch was America’s “point person” for fighting corruption in Ukraine, mostly pressuring prosecutors who refused to prosecute. In the course of doing this, she angered people deeply involved in corrupt activities, especially in the energy industry.

When she saw President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, former Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland trying to pull off their caper for President Trump, Yovanovitch knew where to draw the line.

It is one thing to use the resources of the United States to advance our stated policy to fight corruption in Ukraine. It’s another thing altogether to use those same resources, as I believe Trump did, to bribe a foreign president to smear a political rival – former Vice President Joe Biden.

As Yovanovitch testified, I imagined her first meeting with Giuliani appearing in front of her desk, thinking he’d just brush this dame aside and go about his business. What he saw looking back at him was what we all saw when she testified.

Giuliani didn’t even try to outmaneuver her. He knew he had to get her removed from her post. Yovanovitch had just agreed to extend her tour until 2020 when Giuliani started his smear campaign, and it succeeded quickly. Yovanovitch got yanked out of Ukraine – told to take the next plane out of the country.

Why didn’t the State Department stick up for her, clearly one of our best? The shameful circumstances of her departure justify the question Yovanovitch asked during her testimony: “How could our system fail like this?”

Ambassador Yovanovitch, I hope in the end that the system does not fail. If it has failed you, it has failed all of us, and we must work to rebuild it as soon as we can.

People sometimes talk about the American Experiment and I can see that. Two hundred plus years and we’re still trying to figure things out. And others describe it as the American Dream.

We have been told the word “coup” is hyperbole that reveals the paranoid minds of Trump supporters.

Yet oddly, many people brag that they are proud members of a deep state and occasionally boast about the idea of a coup.

Recently, former acting CIA chief John McLaughlin proclaimed in a public forum, “Thank God for the deep state.” Former CIA Director John Brennan agreed and praised the “deep state people” for their opposition to Trump.

DAN GAINOR: NY TIMES COLUMNIST ADMITS THERE'S AN ANTI-TRUMP DEEP STATE — BUT CLAIMS MEMBERS ARE THE GOOD GUYS

Far from denying the danger of an unelected careerist bureaucracy that seeks to overturn presidential policies, New York Times columnists have praised its efforts to nullify the Trump agenda.

On the first day of the impeachment inquiry, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called his initial two witnesses, career State Department diplomats William Taylor Jr. and George Kent. Far from providing damning evidence of criminal presidential behavior, Taylor and Kent mostly confined themselves to three topics: their own sterling résumés, their lack of any firsthand knowledge of incriminating Trump action, and their poorly hidden disgust with the manner and substance of Trump’s foreign policy.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Oddly, both had little clue that their demeanor and thinly disguised self-importance were a perfect example of why Trump got elected — to come up with new ideas antithetical to the conventional wisdom of unelected career bureaucrats.

Taylor and Kent announced that they are simply high-minded civil servants who serve the presidential administrations of both parties without bias.

But by nature, the huge federal bureaucracy counts on bigger government and more taxes to feed it. So naturally, the bureaucracy is usually more sympathetic to big-government progressives than to small-government conservatives.

Taylor and Kent cited their anguish with Trump’s foreign policy toward Ukraine — namely that it did not go through official channels and was too unsympathetic to Ukraine and too friendly to Russia. If so, one might have thought the anguished bureaucrats would have similarly gone public during the Obama administration.

After all, Vice President Joe Biden took over the Obama administration’s Ukrainian policy at a time when his son Hunter was knee-deep in Ukrainian affairs. As a consultant for a Ukrainian natural gas company, Hunter Biden made a reported $80,000 a month without expertise in either the energy business in particular or Ukraine in general.

Also, Trump’s policies have been more anti-Russian and pro-Ukrainian than those of the Obama administration. Trump armed the Ukrainians; Obama did not. Trump imposed new sanctions against Russia, used force against Russian mercenaries in Syria, beefed-up NATO defenses, pulled the U.S. out an asymmetrical missile treaty with Russia, and pumped more oil and gas to lower world prices — much to the chagrin of oil-exporting Russia.

In contrast, Obama was the architect of “reset” with Russia that reached its nadir in a hot mic exchange in which Obama offered a quid pro quo, vowing more flexibility on issues such as U.S.-sponsored missile defense in Eastern Europe in exchange for Russia giving Obama “space” to concentrate on his reelection.

Trump’s critics have also radically changed their spin on “coups.” To them, “coup” is no longer a dirty word trafficked in by right-wing conspiracists. Instead, it has been normalized as a possibly legitimate means of aborting the Trump presidency.

Mark Zaid, the attorney representing the Ukraine whistleblower, boasted in two recently discovered tweets of ongoing efforts to stage a coup to remove Trump.

“#coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion. #impeachment will follow,” Zaid tweeted in January 2017. Later the same month, he tweeted: “#coup has started. As one falls, two more will take their place.”

Retired Admiral William H. McRaven recently wrote an op-ed for The New York Times all but calling for Trump’s ouster — “the sooner the better.”

No sooner had Trump been elected than Rosa Brooks, a former Defense Department official during the Obama administration, wrote an essay for Foreign Policy magazine discussing theoretical ways to remove Trump before the 2020 election, among them a scenario involving a military coup.

In September 2018, The New York Times published an op-ed from an anonymous White House official who boasted of supposedly widescale efforts inside the Trump administration to nullify its operations and subvert presidential directives.

Such efforts to oppose Trump are often self-described as “The Resistance,” a reference to the underground French fighters resisting the Nazis in World War II.

Trump’s opponents often have praised the deep state precisely because unelected career officials are seen as the most effective way to sabotage and stymie his agenda.

A “coup” is no longer proof of right-wing paranoia, but increasingly a part of the general progressive discourse of resistance to Trump.

In these upside-down times, patriotism is being redefined as removing a president before a constitutionally mandated election.

Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., as the new permanent chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, succeeding Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who died in late October.

""I am deeply humbled and grateful to my colleagues for entrusting me with the chairmanship,"" Maloney said in a statement. ""I'm honored by this opportunity to do more for the American people and will do my best to follow the honorable example that Chairman Cummings left for us all. There's much work to be done, and I can't wait to get started.""

Maloney is the first woman to ever hold the title and served as the acting chair of the influential committee after Cummings died; he was one of several Democrats across three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

Maloney, who has served in Congress for 14 terms and has been a vocal critic of Trump, previously promised that the impeachment probe would continue uninterrupted in the wake of Cummings' death.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi embraced the caucus' pick and called Maloney a ""deeply respected and battle-tested leader.""

“Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney has been a force for progress in America for decades,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""At the helm of the Joint Economic Committee, she has honed a keen understanding of the priorities and needs of the American people, and has worked tirelessly to deliver progress that lifts up families in every corner of America. She brings outstanding legislative experience and knowledge of the workings of the Congress that will strengthen the Oversight Committee’s work at this critical time in our nation’s history.""

“We are confident that Congresswoman Maloney’s leadership will help ensure that the Congress can function as our Founders intended, as a co-equal branch acting as a check and balance on the others, and that our Democratic Majority can continue to achieve progress For The People.”

The committee has consistently drawn the ire of Republicans, particularly with its oversight inquiries of the Trump administration’s handling of the census and immigration matters, as well as Trump’s business dealings and security clearances granted to White House officials.

As the previous chair, Cummings, 68, publicly feuded with Trump over the president's comments this past summer about living conditions in his Baltimore district.

Pelosi praised her friend and colleague Wednesday in naming his replacement.

“The Congress and the country were devastated by the loss of Chairman Elijah Cummings, a master of the House who led the Committee on Oversight and Reform with great honor, integrity and principle,"" she said.

The announcement comes as three House committees spearheading the investigation into Trump -- which is examining whether or not the president committed an impeachable offense by attempting to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid to Ukraine --continue to hold a series of public depositions on Capitol Hill."

On the roster: Sondland bursts the ‘perfect’ bubble - Time Out: Nineteen Thanksgivings ‘over there’ - Buttigieg takes the lead in New Hampshire - Opossum like its hot



SONDLAND BURSTS THE ‘PERFECT’ BUBBLE

President Trump’s ambassador to the European Union didn’t tell us anything today that wasn’t obvious from the moment America first read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.



Gordon Sondland certainly added some context with his descriptions of the Keystone Cops routine by Rudy Giuliani. Sondland also made clear what some had once adamantly denied: That help for Ukraine was contingent on the president’s political demands.



But anybody who didn’t think those things were true after reading Trump’s transcript was either being facile or is a few chicken wings short of a dozen.



Democrats can be happy to have had such a senior official from the Trump administration – a political appointee of the president himself – make their case so clearly.



But there is reason for relief among Republicans, too.



The House GOP has been a messaging disaster throughout this process. It’s not entirely their fault given the contradictory, scattershot efforts from the White House, but it has not been pretty at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.



Democrats with uncharacteristic discipline have homed in on the concept of the president abusing his broad foreign policy powers to try to harm his leading political rival.



Seemingly on a daily rotating basis, the president’s defenders in Congress have tried out myriad defenses. He didn’t do it! If he did do it, everyone else does it! The process is unfair! Trump was just worried about corruption!



The worst version of this stuff has been the tortured explanations about the “bigger” story in Ukraine. As Democrats tell their simpler story about presidential misconduct, some Republicans have been trying to tell a more convoluted one about the real nature of Ukrainian politics.



Sondland’s testimony today should put that all to rest, and that is good news for the GOP.



As we have long argued here, Republicans should be following the playbook laid out in 1998 by Bill Clinton and his team.



Much as with Clinton’s seamy conduct with a White House intern, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of what Trump did to the Ukrainian president. Poll after poll shows that two-thirds or more of voters think the president acted wrongly.



But on the question of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, voters are much more evenly divided. That difference points the way to the useful strategy going forward and a way for the White House to meaningfully diminish support for impeachment.



There’s no sense in trying to convince persuadable voters that what Trump did was “perfect.” That’s a fool’s errand. But arguing that the offense doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment, especially less than a year away from an election, is a political winner.



Acknowledging Trump’s mistake, reminding voters that the system worked – the necessary aid to fight Russia’s military advances in Ukraine did flow to Kyiv – and pointing to next November seems like a much more fruitful place for the GOP to be.



If that approach is consistently applied it could make Democrats look like they are obsessed with obvious, old issues rather than dealing with the matters important to voters.



But that will require Republicans, including the president, to abandon their doctrine of denial and excuse. Sondland made doing so much easier today.



THE RULEBOOK: BIG BOSS MAN

“The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength; and the power of directing and employing the common strength, forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 74



TIME OUT: NINETEEN THANKSGIVINGS ‘OVER THERE’

NYT: “This year marks the 19th Thanksgiving since the beginning of the wars, occupations, operations and deployments that together form what the Pentagon calls the global war on terrorism. Across all this time and terrain, a few million American service members, and those who labored beside them, have accumulated vast and varied observances of a quintessential American holiday spent at war. Earlier this year The Times asked service members, veterans and civilians who have celebrated Thanksgiving in a conflict zone to share their photographs and memories. … Like combat service itself, Thanksgivings for troops have been wildly uneven experiences. Depending on each place and time, dinners and celebrations veered between scarcity and excess, spectacle and sorrow, isolation and crowds. But common themes inform veteran memories, including the longing for home caused by separation from families and lifelong rituals, the bonds many veterans formed with fellow troops, and recollections of rich palettes of emotions associated with the particular circumstances troops lived in while deployed.”

BUTTIGIEG TAKES THE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

WMUR9: “The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll of 255 likely Democratic primary voters shows that [Pete] Buttigieg, supported by 25 percent, now holds a 10 percentage point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are tied for second at 15 percent. Buttigieg is substantially ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is in fourth place at 9 percent. Rounding out the top 10 were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 6 percent; billionaire activist Tom Steyer of California at 5 percent; U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 3 percent each; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York at 2 percent and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 1 percent. Thirteen percent of those polled said they were undecided.”



Can he bring the momentum to the debate stage? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. … But that surge in the early states comes with the glare of additional scrutiny, including on his struggles appealing to African American voters in other states, and the growing likelihood of attacks from Democratic opponents eager to blunt Buttigieg’s rise and regain momentum of their own. … Though the campaign has heated up recently, many candidates are still reluctant to go on the attack and risk alienating a rival’s supporters. But Buttigieg’s strong polling out of Iowa has already come with fresh criticism over several campaign missteps related to one of the mayor’s biggest weaknesses: his lack of support among African American voters, which has contributed to his lower numbers in polls of Democrats in South Carolina and nationally.”



Michael Kruse: Are your neighbors ready for Mayor Pete? - Politico: “Up till now, Buttigieg’s youth and sexual orientation largely have been calling cards in the Democratic primary, distinguishing him in a field whose front-runners are in their 70s and whose back-of-the-packers are too numerous for most people to keep track of. … When it comes to the prospect of a gay president, the numbers right now are sobering for Buttigieg: Polling suggests that the country was more ready for a black president back in 2008 than it is for a gay president now. And last month, the current iteration of the question of readiness became front-page news when a leaked memo revealed focus groups commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested his sexuality could be ‘a barrier’ for black voters in at least South Carolina, the crucial fourth nominating contest—and a bellwether for the party’s more socially conservative voters.”



Biden steps up efforts in Iowa - WaPo: “[Biden] has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals. And now, even as he retains a national lead in polling, he is falling behind in a state that doomed his campaign the last time he sought the presidency. Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”



Foundering Harris calls talk of campaign crack-up ‘gossip’ - Nevada Independent: “California Sen. Kamala Harris is dismissing recent reports of unrest within her campaign and chatter among attendees of a Democratic convention in her home state about whether she should drop out of the presidential race as no more than ‘gossip.’ … With about two and a half months until the first presidential preferences are cast, Harris said that it is “still early” and that “to follow the punditry around what is going on with the campaign is to overlook what’s happening on the street…” But she remained vague when asked whether that enthusiasm had at all changed her campaign’s plans to shift staff from Nevada to Iowa. ‘I will keep you posted but I’m going to tell you something: Nevada is very, very important to me,’ Harris said.”



Adieu, Wayne Messam - Axios: “Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam (D-Fla.) announced on Wednesday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. The big picture: Messam got into the race after Southbend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's announcement, however, the small-town Florida mayor failed to gain the momentum that Buttigieg's campaign achieved. Messam did not make it on to any debate stage and struggled to see significant gains in polling. Messam is Miramar's first black mayor, the owner of a construction company, a former college football player and the son of a Jamaican sugarcane worker.”

“The campaigns, of course, are always, shall I say, hot salsa, but the governing part doesn’t need to be that way.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a speech in his home commonwealth of Kentucky decrying the level of vitriol in government.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“What do you make of the Chairman’s larger than anyone else’s chair? It looks like Queen Elizabeth’s throne to me. Is that standard for the Congress? To me, it makes him look diminutive.” – Tom Winter Lt. Col. USMC (Ret), Steele, Mo.



[Ed. note: It is standard practice for chairmen and chairwomen. And it always has seemed a little silly.]



“So, it would seem that the Democratic Party fear a journalist [Tim Alberta] that is not necessarily in the tank for the Democratic agenda. What a load of disservice to the voters! Our country is greatly endangered by partisan politics and journalism that does not stay clear of taking sides. Perhaps, I am not in the swing of things, but I would like to believe that the American voter could figure out what to do or think without a partisan scorecard. That is probably naive.” – Lisa Lentz, Hollister, Calif.



[Ed. note: Both sides suffer from this affliction. In 2016, Republicans were talking openly about only allowing avowed partisans or right-leaning opinion mongers to moderate debates. It was nearly as pitiful as the effort to assassinate the character of Alberta, one the most respected, finest political reporters working in Washington today because he started his career at a right-leaning publication. I dare anyone to find any partisan hackery in Alberta’s work, wherever he was doing it. But both Republicans and Democrats make a self-defeating mistake when they look for gentle coddling instead of incisive questioning. Are Democrats better off for letting opinion journalists play patty-cake with their candidates these many months? No chance. Insulating candidates from tough questioning has not only help keep the field at its bloated size but also allowed them to ignore the most important issues when it comes to winning in 2020. It’s farcical that Elizabeth Warren made it until October before anyone put the bite on her about her formless, pie-in-the-sky health insurance program. If you can’t handle Tim Alberta for five questions, you darned sure can’t handle the presidency.]

Unfortunately, I do not see the education elites embracing the classics and the much-maligned vocational education necessary to sustain our grand experiment.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.

OPOSSUM LIKE ITS HOT

AP: “A movement is growing in North Carolina to prevent the act of so-called ‘opossum dropping.’ The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year’s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group says it’s continuing its legislative efforts.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“It is pure fiction that this pro-American sentiment was either squandered after Sept. 11 or lost under the Bush Administration. It never existed.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on Nov. 9, 2003.

Potentially problematic figure for Democrats set to testify as key Trump impeachment witnesses undercut claims of 'quid pro quo,' 'bribery' and 'cover-up'

Republicans sounded a celebratory note as House Democrats' impeachment inquiry wrapped up another day of public hearings Tuesday evening, saying the day's witnesses had served only to highlight fundamental problems in the case against President Trump.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking Morrison and Volker about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When asked whether there were indications of quid pro quo, bribery or extortion, they each repeatedly answered, ""No.""

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats in the second week of public hearings in their impeachment inquiry. With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years. Click here for a complete summary of Tuesday's testimony.

A 'Gordon Problem' for Democrats: Democrats' troubles with their case against Trump may continue Wednesday with Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union and perhaps impeachment inquiry's most anticipated witness. Sondland repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Sondland, critics argue, has a credibility problem.

In a closed-door hearing, Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement. Democrats quickly hailed the revelation as proof that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden's family business dealings in the country in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid. However, in prior testimony, Sondland said he had texted Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, that in September saying there was no quid pro quo. Click here for a complete preview of Wednesday's testimony.

Democrats to hold fifth presidential primary debate

The Democratic Party will hold its fifth presidential primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night and it will likely be overshadowed by the Trump impeach inquiry hearing. The following 10 candidates qualified to be on stage for Wednesday's debate: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang.

Wednesday's debate comes amid uncertainty over whether Democrats truly have a candidate who could defeat President Trump next November as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has seriously flirted with the idea of entering the race and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared his candidacy last week. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg may find himself under attack Wednesday night as he has surged in recent polls in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February.

Acquitted Navy SEAL faces review, potential loss of Trident pin, senior US defense official says

The top admiral in the Navy plans to announce a review in which peers will determine whether to remove SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident pin following his highly publicized war crimes case, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Tuesday. The Trident is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, the source told Fox News.

Commander Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the Navy, told Fox News that the chief of naval operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, supported Rear Adm. Collin Green's decision to uphold a mitigated sentence against Gallagher, who was acquitted in July of killing an Islamic State fighter in Iraq. A San Diego jury sentenced Gallagher to a reduced rank and four months of confinement, which he has already served, for posing with the body of the dead ISIS fighter, which was considered the least egregious of the seven charges he was facing. President Trump signed an order last Friday reversing the sentence and ordering the promotion of Gallagher back to the rank he held before his trial.

Better yet, let’s call it a riddle. When is a “quid pro quo” not a “quid pro quo?” The answer is … when it’s “presumed.”

U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that there was a “quid pro quo” between the U.S. and Ukraine, even though President Trump made it crystal clear to Sondland that there was no “quid pro quo.”

So, how did the ambassador arrive at his opinion that a “quid pro quo” must somehow exist? It turns out that he assumed or “presumed” it. At one point, he called it a mere “guess.”

SONDLAND IMPLICATES TOP OFFICIALS ON UKRAINE, BUT SAYS HE ‘NEVER HEARD’ QUID PRO QUO FROM TRUMP

The trouble with presumptions and guess-work is that they are often unreliable and sometimes quite wrong. Assumptions and suppositions, by their nature, can be risky and foolish. We should trust only in what we know that is derived from facts. This was the fatal flaw in Sondland’s narrative.

Here is what we actually know: Nowhere in the July 25 telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is there evidence of a demand, threat, condition or pressure for a “quid pro quo.” None. That is a demonstrable fact, as proven by a transcript of the conversation that the White House released to the public. Read it for yourself.

TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT

There is no mention of military aid in exchange for an investigation into either election meddling by Ukraine in 2016 or a potential corrupt act by former Vice President Joe Biden. Indeed, the U.S. financial assistance was delivered to Kiev and there was no investigation launched.

We also know that President Trump personally informed Sondland: “I want nothing, I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.”

The ambassador confirmed this exculpatory statement Wednesday. It was nearly identical to what he said in his earlier deposition when he testified that the president told him: “I want nothing. I don’t want to give them anything and I don’t want anything from them.” Sondland then elaborated by stating: “He (President Trump) kept repeating no quid pro quo over and over again.”

Yet, throughout his testimony Sondland seemed to oscillate wildly from contradiction to confusion to vacillation. He conspicuously omitted from his lengthy opening statement what proved to be the most stunning revelation of all. He told the committee: “I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement” of investigations.

Here is the important exchange:

Question: Did the president ever tell you personally about any preconditions for anything?

Sondland: No.

Question: OK. So, the president never told you about any preconditions for the aid to be released?

Sondland: No.

The counsel for Republicans seemed dumbfounded that the ambassador would bury the lead. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, was more direct. He mockingly suggested that Sondland’s omission was a deliberate attempt to hide direct evidence that exonerates the president, while emphasizing Sondland’s presumptive illusion of wrongdoing.

Despite the president’s repeated denial of a “quid pro quo,” how did Sondland reach a contrary conclusion? Sondland surmised it.

While other witnesses have relied on a gossip chain of hearsay and conjecture, the ambassador appears to have invested himself in little more than a hunch. This, of course, was warmly embraced by the mainstream media mob. Consider the devastating cross-examination by Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio:

Question: If you pull up CNN today, right now, their banner says “Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid.” Is that your testimony today, Ambassador Sondland? Because I don’t think you’re saying that.

Sondland: I’ve said repeatedly, congressman, I was presuming.

Question: So no one heard. Not just the president. Giuliani didn’t tell you. Mulvaney didn’t tell you. Nobody. Pompeo didn’t tell you. Nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct?

Sondland: I think I already testified.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Question: No, answer the question. No one on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying this aid to the investigation? Because if your answer is yes, then the chairman is wrong. And the headline on CNN is wrong. No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations. Yes or no?

Sondland: Yes.

Question: So you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations.

Sondland: Other than my own presumption.

Throughout four days of tortured hearings, Americans have been force-fed the gruel of speculation, interpretation, opinion, multiple hearsay, and now “presumptions.”

This is impeachment by rumor and innuendo. And that is no presumption.

One of the key witnesses in the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry against Trump, Sondland claimed he kept Secretary of State Mike Pompeo aware of what was going on and said he specifically told Vice President Pence he ""had concerns"" the military aid to Ukraine ""had become tied"" to investigations -- though a Pence aide denied it. And he repeatedly lambasted Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s leading role in the administration’s Ukraine dealings.

""Everyone was in the loop,"" Sondland testified. ""It was no secret.""

READ: GORDON SONDLAND'S IMPEACHMENT HEARING OPENING STATEMENT

Still, in comments seized upon by Republicans, Sondland testified: “I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement"" of investigations. He said he never personally heard Trump discuss preconditions. And at one point, he confirmed Trump told him, ""I want nothing.""

Taken in their entirety, Sondland's statements Wednesday are likely to fuel the narratives of both parties. He was seen as a wild card going into the hearing, given he has offered testimony that conflicted with others' and recently amended his statements to acknowledge he did talk to Ukraine about investigations after initially indicating otherwise.

The impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower’s complaint about Trump's July 25 call when he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for political investigations – including involving former Vice President Joe Biden's family -- at the same time U.S. military aid for the ally was stalled.

Sondland made clear Wednesday he merely presumed the aid was linked to investigations, at one point referring to this as a ""guess.""

But he suggested he had his reasons, agreeing that the conclusion was like ""two plus two equals four."" He stressed he never got a clear answer on why the aid was held up, saying in the absence of an explanation he came to believe that the aid and the investigations were linked.

“I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson,” Sondland said at one point, referring to the Republican senator involved in Ukraine policy. “And I also shared my concerns with the Ukrainians.”

Further, his testimony name-dropped a slew of other top Trump officials, which is likely to pique Democrats' interest.

Sondland, throughout the inquiry, has been portrayed as a key player in an irregular channel of diplomacy led by Giuliani. On Wednesday, Sondland repeatedly expressed his displeasure with Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine policy but said they were working with him at Trump's direction. He also claimed the “suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false.”

“We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani,” Sondland said, explaining he believed State Department officials should take the responsibility for Ukraine matters. “Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.”

While couching his language regarding the aid hold-up, Sondland was more explicit when it came to the link between investigations and a White House meeting and call between Trump and Zelensky. He bluntly described Giuliani's requests linking the two as a quid pro quo.

He told the committee: “I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo? ... As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.”

Sondland also said he and other officials “disagreed with the need to involve” Giuliani but they “did not believe that his role was improper at the time.” He said that ""as a presidential appointee, I followed the directions of the president.”

“If I had known of all of Mr. Giuliani’s dealings or of his associations with individuals now under criminal indictment, I would not have acquiesced to his participation,” Sondland said. “Still, given what we knew at the time, what we were asked to do did not appear to be wrong.”

Giuliani on Wednesday pushed back against Sondland’s testimony, tweeting he “came into this” at the request of then-Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker. “Sondland is speculating based on VERY little contact,"" Giuliani tweeted. ""I never met him and had very few calls with him, mostly with Volker.""

Meanwhile, Sondland described a Sept. 1 meeting between Zelensky and Pence in Warsaw. “I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations,” Sondland said.

But on Wednesday, Pence’s office flatly denied the accusation, saying, “This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened.”

He also repeatedly connected the secretary of state to the Ukraine efforts.

Sondland testified that Pompeo, as late as Sept. 24, was telling Volker to speak with Giuliani. He said Volker sent him a WhatsApp message that said, “Spoke w Rudy per guidance from S.” Sondland said “S” was in reference to the secretary of state.

He also described another conversation on Sept. 1 in Warsaw with Zelenksy’s senior aide, Andriy Yermak, saying he expressed concerns that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement about investigations. “Based on my communications with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. Yermak,” he said.

State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus later denied that the secretary of state talked with Sondland about the aid link: ""Gordon [Sondland] never told Secretary Pompeo that he believed the president was linking aid to investigations of political opponents. Any suggestion to the contrary is flat out false.”

On Wednesday, Sondland said he was not on the July call and didn’t read a transcript until it was publicly released in September. He called it “very odd” that he never received a detailed read-out of the call with the Biden references. Sondland also repeatedly made clear he did not support preconditions on the aid.

“We had no desire to set any conditions on the Ukrainians,” Sondland said. “Indeed, my personal view -- which I shared repeatedly with others -- was that the White House meeting and security assistance should have proceeded without pre-conditions of any kind.”

Sondland on Wednesday said his goal, at the time, was to do what was necessary to get the aid released. Asked if it's true he told Trump at one point that Zelensky ""loves your ass,"" the diplomat replied ""sounds like something I would say"" to laughter in the hearing room.

Republicans dismissed the proceedings as they have done during previous sessions. California Rep. Devin Nunes, the GOP’s top member on the committee, told the witness: ""Ambassador Sondland, you are here today to be smeared.”

Nunes also reiterated calls for the committee to subpoena Hunter Biden, the whistleblower who wrote the complaint against Trump and Democratic National Committee documents – something Democrats have not granted.

VINDMAN ACCUSES TRUMP OF MAKING IMPROPER UKRAINE ‘DEMAND,’ SAYS HE ALERTED INTEL OFFICIAL

Republicans on the committee also defended Trump by emphasizing how Ukraine got what they wanted without ever announcing an investigation. “They didn’t have to do anything,” Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan said, adding “they get the call, they get the meeting, they get the money.""

Jordan accused Sondland of getting all three of those ""wrong"": “It’s not two plus two, it’s 0 for 3.”

Sondland later expressed frustration when a Democratic congressman, Sean Maloney on New York, repeatedly tried to get him to say Trump would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens. He eventually said, ""I assume President Trump would benefit.""

The diplomat added: “I’ve been really forthright, and I really resent what you’re trying to do.”

Maloney mocked Sondland for having to previously amend his testimony. “We appreciate your candor, but let’s be clear what it took to get it out of you,” he said.

Meanwhile, the top committee Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, in his opening remarks accused Trump and Pompeo of making ""such a concerted and across-the-board effort to obstruct this investigation and this impeachment inquiry."" Schiff added, ""They do so at their own peril.""

Sondland's appearance at Wednesday morning's hearing, and his closeness to Trump, is of particular concern to the White House as the historic impeachment inquiry reaches closer to the president, pushing through an intense week with nine witnesses testifying over three days in back-to-back sessions. But Trump, talking to reporters outside the White House on Wednesday, referenced Sondland's comments that he wanted nothing from Ukraine and argued, “That means it’s all over.”

Among the details that other witnesses have filled in are those concerning a call he placed to Trump from a busy Kiev restaurant the day after the president prodded Ukraine's leader to investigate the Bidens. After another diplomat witness revealed this, Sondland confirmed Wednesday they had the call -- saying Sondland doesn't remember much of it but has no reason to doubt other accounts, which said the conversation dealt with the topic of investigations.

Sondland, who has had to amend his testimony related to his conversations with Ukraine, told lawmakers he has had hundreds of meetings and calls with individuals in his role but is not a note-taker. He said he has requested documents from the State Department and the White House for documents phone records to help refresh his memory. “In the absence of these materials, my memory has not been perfect,” he said.

Sondland's appearance follows the testimony Tuesday of four national security and diplomatic officials, including Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a career Army officer, who described Trump's call with Zelenskiy as ""improper."" Also testifying later Wednesday are Pentagon official Laura Cooper and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale.

He wants Barr to state publicly that even if the president did what congressional Democrats claim -- conditioning the release of $391 million in vital military and financial aid to Ukraine upon the announcement of a Ukrainian government investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden -- such behavior did not constitute impeachable offenses.

The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality.

It is unseemly for the chief law enforcement officer in the land to make partisan attacks against ideological groups. This gives the impression that he is a political hack, not an impartial instigator and supervisor of criminal prosecutions.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: SCHIFF GAMES TRUMP IMPEACHMENT SHOW — IN LEGITIMATE PROCEEDINGS, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS

However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.

The Constitution was written to establish and to constrain the federal government. James Madison gave us a limited federal government and a presidency that was limited to enforcing the laws Congress enacted. This limited central government is the Madisonian model -- the feds may only do that which the Constitution expressly or impliedly authorizes.

When Woodrow Wilson came to the presidency, he had new ideas about the nature of the federal government. And he succeeded in imposing those ideas on the executive branch he headed and on the Congress whose appetitive for more power he whetted.

Wilson turned a modest constitutional presidency on its head. He argued, for example, that because the First Amendment prohibits Congress from infringing upon the freedom of speech, it imposed no such restraints on the presidency. That was his justification for dispatching a federal police force he created on his own -- which would later become the FBI -- to arrest young men for singing German beer hall songs in bars and taverns during World War I and for reading aloud the Declaration of Independence near the entrances to draft registration facilities.

Wilson also argued that the concept of the president as “head of state” gave him powers not articulated in the Constitution -- powers inherent in foreign heads of state. From this he crafted the Wilsonian model -- the feds can do whatever draws political support, except that which the Constitution expressly prohibits.

All post-Wilson presidents have followed his model, and this is where Attorney General Barr misses his mark. Madison predicted that the most feared branch of the new government -- the one that could get away with the most lawlessness, the one whose power would expand at the expense of the other two -- would be the presidency.

He was right.

Franklin D. Roosevelt closed banks and seized gold. Harry Truman unleashed domestic spies on Americans and killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of innocent Japanese civilians at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Dwight Eisenhower ratcheted up domestic spying. Lyndon B. Johnson fought an illegal war by duping Congress into funding it. Richard Nixon spied on folks who exercised free speech that was critical of him and bombed Cambodia without any congressional authorization.

George H.W. Bush fought undeclared wars in Panama and Iraq and sent troops to kidnap a foreign head of state. Bill Clinton raised taxes retroactively and bombed an aspirin factory in Kosovo to divert American attention from his disastrous televised interrogation before a federal grand jury. George W. Bush authorized foreign torture and massive domestic spying. Barack Obama declared war on Libya and rewrote immigration laws that Congress rejected. President Trump has imposed a sales tax that he calls a tariff, bombed Syria without congressional consent, defied federal court orders at the border and spent money from the federal treasury not appropriated by Congress.

All of these presidential misdeeds were without constitutional authority and without sanction. Stated differently, they got away with it. Except in Nixon's case, not Congress, not the courts, and not the American public interfered. In fact, they looked the other way as the imperial presidency grew.

The common historical theme in all this is the willingness of Congress and the American public to accept claims of temporary safety over the loss of personal liberty.

The presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama are particularly instructive. A Republican Congress gave Bush the power to force computer service providers and telecoms to work as federal spies against their will. And a Democratic Congress gave Obama the power to regulate the personal delivery of health care in private settings.

Trump has inherited all this, and Barr knows all this. No post-Wilson president has been loyal to his oath to remain within the confines of the Constitution, because power by its nature expands. And power once given -- by Republican Congresses to Republican presidents and by Democratic Congresses to Democratic presidents -- remains in the presidency.

When Rome was threatened by serious invasions of pirates during the last days of the Republic, the Roman Senate gave near-dictatorial powers to the famous general Pompey, which he used to fight and defeat the invaders. When the wars were over, Pompey retained his powers. Cicero famously asked why the Republic repelled invaders so as to enjoy the rule of law only to give it away to a strong man. He complained that the Senate gave so much power to the general, it was now powerless to contain him.

And then, after Pompey passed his powers on to Caesar, the Republic ended and the imperial dictatorship began.

Truth derives sustenance from facts, whereas opinion is a judgment influenced by prejudices. Leonardo da Vinci recognized the fallible nature of opinions when he observed: “The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.”

Deception was on full display Tuesday during the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearing, where opinions masqueraded as facts. Diplomatic witnesses offered their interpretations and judgments of a telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats yearn to impeach Trump over a purported “quid pro quo” that is found nowhere in the transcript of the phone call.

MORRISON, VOLKER UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO,' 'BRIBERY' AND 'COVER-UP' IN PIVOTAL DAY OF TESTIMONY

Bereft of facts, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is determined to remove Trump from office based purely on the opinions of others who surmised or imagined that Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden or the U.S. would withhold $391 million in military aid to Kiev. Ukraine never launched such an investigation, and the financial support was delivered.

Anyone can read the transcript, as it is available online. It speaks for itself and is the best evidence that there is no evidence at all of a “quid pro quo.” This was corroborated by the statements of Zelensky, who confirmed that there was no demand, threat, condition or pressure applied by Trump. It was a “normal” conversation, he said.

Indeed, the Ukrainian government never knew that U.S. aid had been temporarily frozen until almost five weeks after the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call. This renders a “quid pro quo” a legal impossibility.

The recipient of the “quid” must, at the very least, be aware of the “quo.” Moreover, two of the testifying witnesses readily conceded that the frozen aid was “consistent with administration policy.” So much for the infamous “quid pro quo.”

No matter. Schiff called four witnesses Tuesday to render their gratuitous opinions that were conjured up from either a remarkable feat of telepathy or borne of prejudice.

Taking center stage was Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a staffer on the National Security Council who listened to the Trump-Zelensky conversation when it occurred. No one should doubt Vindman’s patriotism. He deserves our universal respect and gratitude. It is his judgment, opinion, and actions that are suspect. He is not immune to criticism simply because of his heroic service in uniform.

After scolding Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., a civilian, for not addressing him by his military rank, Vindman testified that he felt “concerned” about Trump’s conversation with Zelensky. This was nothing more than his opinion, impression or feeling. We all have them. They are a poor substitute for facts. “I was making a judgment call as a layman,” Vindman confessed.

The unvarnished truth is that Vindman did not like what Trump said on the phone call because the president did not strictly follow the notes Vindman had prepared for the discussion. In describing the call, Vindman stated: “This was not in the preparation material that I had offered.”

How dare Trump deviate from Vindman’s carefully crafted diplomatic script! So Vindman complained.

Instead of registering his complaint with his direct supervisor, Tim Morrison, Vindman conveyed his feelings to others. Among them was an individual in the intelligence community that Vindman won’t identify, who may be the faux “whistleblower” or source for the “whistleblower,” who then filed a complaint that doesn’t qualify under the whistleblower statute as a valid complaint. This was the conclusion of the Department of Justice in an 11-page opinion.

By his acts, it appears that Vindman was instrumental in initiating the current impeachment insanity. An unelected subordinate employee disagreed with the policy judgment of the president of the United States and sought to create havoc by disseminating (or, if you prefer, leaking) his discordant opinion.

To make matters worse, Vindman contorted the president’s use of the words “do me a favor” by asserting that Trump had made an “inappropriate demand” of Zelensky.

Inasmuch as there is no demand identified in the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky phone call, Vindman elected to impute a demand by arguing that for those who serve in the military, a request or favor for something is always considered a demand.

In other words, Vindman applied a military standard to a president who has never served in the military and has stated unequivocally that he made no demands of Zelensky. The Ukrainian president, who also did not serve in the military, is on record stating that no demand was made of him, as noted earlier. But Vindman, armed with uncommon clairvoyance, somehow knows better.

Perhaps Vindman thought that he was above the president or a super-special expert to which all individuals, including Trump, should defer. The witness was reminded of how he had touted (or exaggerated) his unparalleled credentials and authority during his earlier closed-door deposition:

In his deposition Vindman stated: “I’m the director for Ukraine. I’m responsible for Ukraine. I’m the most knowledgeable. I’m the authority for Ukraine, for the National Security Council and the White House.”

The self-puffery was unbecoming, but it spoke volumes about what may have motivated Vindman when President Trump had the audacity to conduct foreign policy in a way that his NSC staffer did not pre-approve.

Schiff called four witnesses Tuesday to render their gratuitous opinions that were conjured up from either a remarkable feat of telepathy or borne of prejudice.

In reality, just how important was Vindman in the White House hierarchy? He conceded that he has never so much as met the president.

Vindman’s bias and coziness with Ukraine was underscored when he admitted that the foreign government had offered on three separate occasions to make him its defense minister. He rejected the overtures.

But Vindman’s boss, National Security Council official Tim Morrison, had previously called into question Vindman’s judgment, although he refused to elaborate.

Not everyone who listened to the Trump-Zelensky call agreed with Vindman’s opinion that Trump’s call was “improper.” Foreign Service Officer Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, called the conversation “unusual,” but testified that she did not see the need to report the matter.

Morrison was asked if anything concerned him about the call and replied “no.” Former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker testified that he was “never involved in anything I considered to be bribery or quid pro quo.”

Throughout the hearing, Schiff turned himself into a pretzel as he tried to rewrite the law. He shut down any questions to Vindman that might unmask the fake “whistleblower” by asserting erroneously that the unidentified undercover informant “has a statutory right to anonymity.”

Schiff neglected, of course, to cite the specific statute because it does not exist. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) makes no mention of anonymity. There is a narrow provision that grants the inspector general the discretion to disclose the name or not, but it applies to no one else, including Congress. There is no right, guarantee or privilege to anonymity anywhere in any statute.

During the hearing, Schiff adopted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent pivot from the term “quid pro quo” to “bribery,” after Democrats reportedly found through a focus group that it was a more compelling label for Americans to digest.

But the chairman unwittingly destroyed the bribery argument when he confessed that “bribery does involve a quid pro quo.” But wait. If the Ukrainians had no knowledge of the “quid pro quo,” there can be no bribery. This obvious point seemed lost on Schiff, a former prosecutor.

Members of the unelected bureaucracy in our nation’s diplomatic corps are entitled to their moral, ethical and policy differences. But they are not allowed to substitute their own judgments for those of the president and seek to undermine his authority on foreign policy.

A president should only be removed based on an impeachable offense supported by facts, not opinions. Why? Because, as the Athenian philosopher Plato recognized: “Opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance.”

It never ends.

Washington endured, and the rest of America ignored, yet another round of it on Wednesday. The hearings consumed virtually every hour of Wednesday's available daylight and elevated to international celebrity this country's current ambassador to the European Union, a man called Gordon Sondland.

In contrast to other recent witnesses, Sondland wasn't obviously hostile to the administration. In fact, he was appointed directly by President Trump. He was also a major Trump donor. So, given those two facts, Sondland's opening statement this morning initially looked like a complete disaster for the administration.

KEN STARR ON IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS SO FAR: WE'RE 'NOWHERE CLOSE' TO IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES

Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to European Union: I know that members of this committee frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question, ""Was there a quid pro quo?"" As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is, ""Yes.""

So that's how the morning began. ""The answer is, 'Yes,'"" said Gordon Sondland. ""There was a quid pro quo."" And not only that, he explained, pretty much everybody knew about it.

Sondland: Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19th, days before the presidential call.

Holy smokes! For a moment there, it looked like case closed. The final ignominious end of the Trump presidency, the one that our perpetually excitable friends in the news media have been confidently predicting day after rage-filled day, for more than three years now. The last meltdown -- the great Orange Hindenburg finally bursts into flames.

In TV studios across midtown Manhattan, cable news contributors struggled to hold back tears of joy. And then Adam Schiff took the microphone.

Schiff, as the ringmaster of this particular circus, was determined to bring it to its final theatrical close. ""Tell us,"" Adam Schiff said, ""about President Trump's deal with Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden in return for foreign aid.""

It was the moment Democrats had been waiting for. But, when it finally arrived, Gordon Sondland wouldn't read from the script.

Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: Though President Trump claimed to you there was no quid pro quo, he also made it clear to you in that call that President Zelensky had to ""clear things up and do it in public."" You don't have a reason to dispute that's what you told --

Sondland: I don't have any reason to dispute the ""clear things up and do it in public."" What I'm trying to be very clear about was President Trump never told me directly that the aid was tied to that statement.

Schiff: But in that same conversation you had with him about the aid, about the quid pro quo, he told you that President Zelensky had to ""clear things up and do it in public,"" correct?

Sondland: I did not have a conversation with him about the aid. I had a conversation with him as referenced in my text about quid pro quo.

Schiff: Well, the quid pro quo you were discussing was over the aid, correct?

Sondland: No. President Trump -- when I asked him the open-ended question, as I testified previously, ""What do you want from Ukraine,"" his answer was, ""I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing."" That's all I got from President Trump.

So, they pushed him, and they pushed him, and they pushed him again, but Gordon Sondland would not, in the end, mouth Adam Schiff's talking points. Well, why not?

Maybe because he didn't have any evidence that they were true.

As Sondland conceded in the exchange with Congressman Michael Turner, his assessment of any deals Trump may have struck with Ukraine was based mostly on assumptions.

U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio: No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations - yes or no?

Sondland: Yes.

Turner: So, you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations?

Sondland: Other than my own presumption.

Turner: Which is nothing.

This is tiresome. And of course, we apologize for it as we have in nights' past. But since it's happening, we feel duty-bound to explain it.

So a presumption. Now, some presumptions are correct. Others are laughably wrong. But one thing a presumption definitely isn't is evidence. You can't overturn an election based on a presumption. You can't stage an impeachment on presumptions. You need facts to do that. And as the day went on, Sondland introduced a new fact: the president, Gordon Sondland told us, had told him explicitly that he, in fact, didn't want a quid pro quo with Ukraine.

U.S. Rep Jim Jordan, R-Ohio: You said to the president of the United States, ""What do you want from Ukraine?"" The president: ""I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing. I want him to do what he ran on.""

Why didn't you put that statement in your opening statement? I think you said you couldn't fit it in. Is that right? Instead, we might be here for 46 minutes instead of 45 minutes?

Sondland: It wasn't -- it wasn't purposeful, trust me.

Jordan: It wasn't purposeful?

Sondland: No.

Jordan: Couldn't fit it in a 23-page opener?

It's a fair question, actually. So why wasn't that fact -- and it's not a small point, by the way. It's the point on which the entire impeachment hangs. Why wasn't that point included in Sondland's opening statement? Well, we don't know, really, but here's one possible explanation.

The statement was likely drafted by Sondland's legal team. All four of his attorneys -- it turns out, because we checked -- are Democratic donors. The man seated next to Gordon Sondland today during the hearing, that would be a man called Robert Luskin. He has given over $130,000 to the Democrats over the years. Luskin also represented the FBI informant, Stefan Halper during the Russia hoax not too long ago.

Yes, a lot of people in Washington despise Donald Trump. But still, to this moment, nobody can prove a crime.

So is it possible that someone like Luskin was thinking about more than his client's personal interests in this case? Could impeaching public enemy No. 1 have crossed his mind? We don't know, but it doesn't seem implausible.

We should also point out something that the press conveniently overlooked in its analysis Wednesday for the most part. Gordon Sondland and his family have been under intense political pressure -- in some cases, scary political pressure -- from the left for weeks.

Protesters have swarmed Gordon Sondland and his family in public. Democratic politicians have endorsed boycotts -- pushed boycotts -- of his businesses, his livelihood. In other words, the left has been working the refs. And that shouldn't surprise you because, for the left, this is total war.

And yet, in this one case, it didn't quite work. By the close of business today, we were back right where we were when the Ukraine circus started. In fact, we're back where we were on November 9, 2016.

Yes, a lot of people in Washington despise Donald Trump. But still, to this moment, nobody can prove a crime. Don't tell the press, though. They're celebrating as if someone did.

Jeffrey Toobin, CNN legal analyst: Now we know that every fantasy about how corrupt this administration was is actually true.

Brian Williams, MSNBC anchor: For our live coverage of the blowtorch testimony this morning from Gordon Sondland -- [he] turns out to be the guy that has offered the most stunning testimony.

Ari Melber, MSNBC anchor: In addition to that and the bombshells we've heard about, this was an IED from Mr. Sondland.

Nicolle Wallace, MSNBC anchor: As you said, taking a blowtorch to even the defense Donald Trump has offered -- we don't say this very often anymore, because it's rarely true, but I think today changed everything.

So, you heard it. ""Bombshells, IEDs, blowtorches."" Who writes the metaphors for these hair hats? It sounds like Wednesday's hearing was taking place in ISIS territory, in the caliphate. But the really telling line comes from the CNN legal analyst -- and we're quoting now: ""Every fantasy about how corrupt this administration was is actually true.""

So pause for a minute and think about what he's telling you. All of the fantasies the press has held without evidence are true based on testimony from another person who doesn't have evidence.

So you remember the Russia collusion story? Remember Stormy Daniels? Remember every totally baseless -- and in some cases, insane -- allegation that people like CNN's legal analyst Toobin invented and promoted and used to try to affect elections and, in so doing, destroyed lives? Well, they're telling us that all of them were true because of our presumptions. That's the most revealing thing in all of this.

From the beginning, Washington has had ""presumptions"" about what the new president was like, about what policies voters were allowed to choose. Voters weren't allowed to end foreign wars by casting a ballot, or to put America first, or to secure America's borders.

That's not on the table. Those aren't menu options. This isn't a real democracy, according to the people who administer the democracy.

And, by the way, that ought to make you nervous. You come to Washington, the city that's in charge of our democracy, and no one believes in it? You're like -- if you showed up in Detroit and everyone's driving a Japanese car, would it make you nervous? It would.

And they don't believe in it. And so, what they're really saying to voters is you can't actually make changes to American policies, the ones that we support. All you're allowed to do is rubber-stamp the current status quo, the one that enriches private equity managers and defense contractors and parasites in the vast federal bureaucracy -- our donors and friends. Other than that, shut up and obey.

So that's their program. And maybe they'll succeed in the end. Maybe they'll remove the president. OK. What then?

Well, Washington will celebrate, of course. But will they have learned anything from the exercise? Will the 2016 election have changed their minds or their priorities at all, in any way? Or will they continue to console themselves with the whole thing was just some weird aberration run by Russia and racists in the heartland. Something that they can safely ignore and return to a kind of arrangement that looks very much like 1998 -- or 1978 for that matter.

Well, you know the answer to that. If the people in charge were capable of learning anything, our country wouldn't look like it does today.

* For the second time this week, a poll out of Iowa offers good news for Pete Buttigieg: a new Iowa State University poll found the former mayor leading the Democrats’ presidential field with 26%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 19%. Bernie Sanders is a very close third with 18% followed by Joe Biden at 12%.

* In New York, a new Siena College poll found Biden leading Warren among Democratic voters, 24% to 14%, with the former vice president’s support fueled in large part by African-American support. Sanders is a close third with 13% in the poll.

* Google announced changes to its policy on microtargeted advertising yesterday. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Under the new policy, political ads can only be targeted based on users’ age, gender, and location at the postal-code level. Political advertisers will also still be able to display ads based on the content of the page a user is viewing. Advertisers would no longer be able to target political ads based on users’ interests inferred from browsing or search history.”

“I’m wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,” Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked.

“No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,” Biden fired back before attacking the reporter.

“Only you would ask that,” Biden said. “You’re a good man. You’re a good man. Classy.”

CNN’S CHRIS CUOMO MOCKED AFTER ATTEMPT TO DISPROVE TRUMP’S PHONE THEORY WITH CALL TO MOM FAILS

DNA tests reportedly confirm ""with scientific certainty"" that Hunter Biden is the father, according to court documents filed in Arkansas on Wednesday.

In a motion to partially seal information about the baby from the public as part of an ongoing child support suit, an attorney for Lunden Alexis Roberts, the child's mom, asked that the name, sex and any other identifying information of the infant, referred to as Baby Doe in court documents, be withheld from public court records to protect the child from any attention associated with Joe Biden's prominency.

The attorney, Clinton Lancaster, informed the court in Independence County that because onetime Vice President Joe Biden ""is considered by some to be the person most likely to win his party’s nomination and challenge President Trump on the ballot in 2020,” the child and those close to him or her should be entitled to the same protections afforded to Biden's other kin.

""Baby Doe's paternity could put the child and those close to the child at risk of harm for the same reasons the Biden family is protected by the United States Secret Service,"" the document said.

MEDIA'S ‘CLUMSY HANDLING’ OF BOTCHED REPORT ATTRIBUTING OBAMA-ERA STATS TO TRUMP BLASTED BY CRITICS

""The goal is to make identifying information about the child more difficult to obtain,"" Lancaster told Fox News.

Roberts' paternity suit was first filed on May 28 when she alleged that she and Hunter Biden “were in a relationship” and that “Baby Doe” was born in August 2018 “as a result of that relationship,” according to reports by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENDS FUNDRAISING EMAIL CELEBRATING DEBATE PERFORMANCE HOURS BEFORE EVENT BEGINS

In July, Biden denied having sexual relations with Roberts, according to an article by The New Yorker. He agreed to submit to a paternity test in October. Wednesday's court filings said Biden ""is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process.""

This isn’t the first time Biden found an issue with Doocy’s questions on the campaign trail.

Back in August, Doocy issued a live fact check when Biden claimed to reporters that he drew larger crowds than other Democratic candidates.

""What I'm trying to do is go around from town to town and I'm drawing as big of crowds, or bigger than anybody,"" Biden said. ""Have you seen anybody draw bigger crowds than me in this state?""

""Yes,"" Doocy responded before noting that he saw a bigger crowd for Sen. Elizabeth Warren when she visited Des Moines in January.

""The vice president didn't seem to like that because a few minutes later he singled me out,"" Doocy explained, saying Biden referred to himself as a “big boy” during an exchange.

In September, Biden stuck his finger in Doocy’s face and told him to “ask the right questions” when the reporter attempted to get a comment on Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings.

The eight-day tour is set to cover 18 counties and is designed to help Biden's image, as his Democratic frontrunner status hangs in the balance.

The tour's name is likely derived from his 2012 vice presidential debate against former GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, when he told the Wisconsin Republican that his critique of the Obama administration's foreign policy was, ""a bunch of malarkey.""

“When Joe Biden first announced he was running, he told Iowans they’d be seeing a lot of him — and he meant it,” Biden campaign manager George Schultz said. “Being honest, upfront and authentic is core to who Joe Biden is and why Iowans love him.”

The tour is set to begin on Nov. 30 and will include stops in Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Mason City, Elkader, Decorah, and Oelwein.

Schultz added that ""when it comes to protecting health care, rebuilding the middle class, and defeating Donald Trump, Joe will continue laying out a clear vision about how he will deliver results for working families.""

Biden was mocked on Thursday by former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod during a CNN debate panel. Axelrod said Biden was ""Mr. Magooing his way"" through the primary.

""Biden, I wouldn’t say that he was a house of fire in any of the debates that we’ve been to. And yet he comes — kind of bumps along, kind of Mr. Magoo-ing his way through this,"" Axelrod said.

With the exception of a back-and-forth with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on whether to legalize or decriminalize marijuana, Biden came out strong and made a pitch for his electability versus President Trump, Baier said Wednesday on ""Fox News @ Night.""

However, Baier noted that Biden -- a longtime U.S. senator from Delaware before serving as VP under former President Barack Obama -- was never asked about his son Hunter Biden's international business dealings, including in Ukraine, which were a topic of discussion in Wednesday's impeachment hearings.

During the debate, Biden told the audience they should ask themselves which candidate is ""most likely to be able to win the presidency in the first place, and secondly who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate.""

He also remarked the day's impeachment hearings ""taught"" him an important idea.

""That Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee,"" Biden said.

ADAM SCHIFF CLOSES PUBLIC HEARING WITH ANIMATED SPEECH: ‘THIS PRESIDENT BELIEVES HE IS ABOVE THE LAW’

Trump has come under fire from House Democrats over his July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden's dealings in the country. House Democrats said the president withheld $400 million in military aid as a condition of Ukraine launching the investigation. Trump and the White House repeatedly have denied he did anything wrong.

On the roster: Dems hustle to separate black voters from Biden - Hearings done, House plots next steps on impeachment - Trump says Pompeo may run for Senate - Get your hooves did



DEMS HUSTLE TO SEPARATE BLACK VOTERS FROM BIDEN

WaPo: “[Pete] Buttigieg and [Cory] Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances? … Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. … [Kamala] Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night. Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — ‘because they know me, they know who I am.’”



Warren makes plea to black women - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a full-throated pitch to black women in a much-hyped speech [in Atlanta] on Thursday night as she tries to tear into former Vice President Joe Biden’s durability with black voters. ‘The fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,’ Warren said at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college. … Warren cast her own campaign as learning from workers battles led by black women, from washerwomen in 1881 to the formation of the National Domestic Workers of America in the 1960s and ‘70s. … Black women, the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting bloc, led every part of the program on Thursday with the exception of Warren herself.”



Biden heckled over Obama-era deportations - Fox News: “A seemingly frustrated Joe Biden advised a protester to ‘vote for Trump’ Thursday after being confronted about the Obama administration’s record on deportations. It happened at a South Carolina town hall event for the former vice president, before about 800 people at Lander University in Greenwood. Biden seemed to lose his cool when Carlos Rojas, an immigration activist with a group called Cosecha Movement, pointed out that more illegal immigrants were deported during Obama's first two years as president than during Trump’s. … ‘You should vote for Trump. You should vote for Trump,’ Biden retorted, turning away from the man. … At that point a group of protesters -- many holding signs reading ‘Not 1 More Deportation’ – began to chant that very phrase, demanding Biden pledge to stop deporting all illegal immigrants if he’s elected president. ‘No matter what happens, if someone commits perjury, they should be deported,’ Biden pressed.”



Buttigieg campaign staffers unionize - HuffPo: “Field organizers on the presidential campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have joined a union, the campaign announced on Thursday. It said in a statement that the campaign had ‘voluntarily recognized’ that IBEW Local 2321 would serve as the sole union representing campaign staffers who have the title ‘organizer.’ Staffers were informed that the organizers were forming a union, and the campaign supported that move on Thursday afternoon. In a statement, Buttigieg campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said the campaign welcomed the workers’ decision.”



Continetti: Why candidates matter most - Free Beacon: “The coverage of recent Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana has emphasized President Trump's failure to drag Republicans past the finish line. Analysts have focused on Democratic strength in the suburban regions of these states, as well as in the suburbs of Mississippi where the Republican won by a surprisingly slim 5 points. Both of these storylines are important. But so is this one: Candidate attributes and positions matter more than a state or nation's partisan tilt. President Trump and his 17 Democratic challengers might want to pay attention. … Likability and empathy matter more than wonkiness and purity. … How ironic if Democrats so concerned with electability in the primary find themselves backing a flawed and uninspiring candidate in the general. Because, you see, fate can work that way in the Twilight Zone.”



Bloomberg files federal papers to join race - WaPo: “Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a Democratic candidate for president, a potentially disruptive move that could upend the party’s nomination fight this spring. The filing, coming just eight months after Bloomberg ruled out a bid because he believed it would be too hard to win the Democratic nomination, reflects his view that the field of Democratic contenders was not well positioned to win next year and that a candidate with his experience, political moderation and deep pockets would have a better chance of defeating President Trump in a general election. Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision.”



Obama warns Dems about ‘purity tests’ in the primary - AP: “Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting ‘purity tests’ in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. … Obama urged Democrats to ‘chill out,’ saying, ‘The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide’ better health care and education and address climate change.”



John Hendrickson: What Joe Biden can’t bring himself to say - Atlantic: “Maybe you’ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden’s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. … Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific—’ He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SHORT AND SWEET

“It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature… One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71



TIME OUT: NOT ALL BLARNEY

Smithsonian: “Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman provides a decades-spanning look at one man’s relationship to organized crime, organized labor, and the truth – however slippery that concept may be. That man, Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, was a union official and mob associate whose story intersects with labor organizer Jimmy Hoffa, the Mafia, and the Kennedys. The film, Scorsese’s first to stream exclusively on Netflix, is adapted from the 2004 Sheeran biography I Heard You Paint Houses by writer Charles Brandt, in which Sheeran claims that he killed Hoffa, amongst other figures. Hoffa’s sudden disappearance in 1975 still looms large as one of America’s longest-standing unsolved mysteries…. And while many Hoffa scholars think Sheeran’s claims are bogus, and that Scorsese … got the story wrong, the film’s portrait of how organized crime became interwoven with the labor movement and the highest levels of government in the 20th century carries many elements of truth.”

HEARINGS DONE, HOUSE PLOTS NEXT STEPS ON IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “The public phase of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal appears to have wrapped. But even most House Democrats aren’t clear what happens next. The Judiciary Committee will draft and vote on articles of impeachment and send those to the full House for debate, that much is clear. But how the Judiciary panel completes the already unorthodox impeachment process is still up in the air. Though lawmakers and aides expect the 1998 proceedings against former President Bill Clinton to be the model for the Trump case, they’re quick to emphasize they haven't been told how the endgame will play out. In fact, Judiciary Committee members have received little guidance from party leaders on how the panel will conduct the proceedings or the timeframe for completing them, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides.”



White House, Senate GOP plan for brief trial starting in January - WaPo: “A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks, according to multiple officials familiar with the talks. The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, described by officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private meeting, the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely.”



Graham readies hearings to target Biden - WaPo: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday requesting documents related to former vice president Joe Biden and his communications with Ukrainian officials, a step seen as a GOP effort to counter the House impeachment investigation of President Trump. The inquiry by Graham (R-S.C.) is focused on any calls Biden may have had with Petro Poroshenko, then the Ukrainian president, regarding the firing of the country’s top prosecutor, as well as any that referenced an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that employed Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation.”



Fear the mustache - Fox News: “Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose name has repeatedly surfaced in the impeachment hearings as a witness to key events, returned to Twitter on Friday following an unexplained hiatus since his resignation in September -- cryptically vowing to share the ‘backstory’ while saying his account had been ‘suppressed unfairly.’ ‘Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned….’ Bolton tweeted early Friday. … Later, Bolton tweeted again, adding: ‘We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come…’”



Report: FBI lawyer altered document related to Carter Page - NY Post: “A former FBI lawyer allegedly altered a document related to surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the 2016 election, a report said Thursday. The evidence of the altered document was turned over to federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating how intelligence was gathered by agencies including the CIA and FBI during the probe into the Trump campaign, CNN reported. It’s not clear what role the altered document played in the investigation into Page — or if a FISA warrant against him would have been okayed without the fudged document, according to the report.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Beware of dangers of an imperial presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses Attorney General William Barr’s role in the impeachment inquiry: “Throughout the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, President Trump has been pushing Attorney General William Barr to make a public statement on the president's behalf. …The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality. … However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.” More here.



TRUMP SAYS POMPEO MAY RUN FOR SENATE

The Kansas City Star: “President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is mulling a run for Senate in Kansas next year. In a lengthy phone interview with Fox & Friends, Trump said Pompeo would ‘easily’ win the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. ‘He loves the people of Kansas. If he thought that there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas,’ Trump said. Pompeo’s office declined to comment on the president’s remarks, which come after months of speculation that he might give up his post as top diplomat to launch a Senate run. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has repeatedly encouraged the former Wichita congressman to enter the race. Pompeo has downplayed his interest, but Trump’s comments ensure that the buzz will persist. Kansas has a filing deadline of June 1, later than many states.”

You're probably already familiar; but if not, here's the one I have on constant repeat for the season: The John Rutter Christmas Album. Cheers and a happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.” – Deanna Ducher, Hillsdale, Mich.



[Ed. note: Funny you would say so Ms. Ducher! So wonderful are our readers and listeners that I can scarcely sometimes believe it. First, a little context for folks who may have missed the podcast: This is a challenging time of year musically for Christians. Thanksgiving is not quite here and Advent is still more than a week away. Meantime, every store, suggested playlist, Uber driver’s sound system and seemingly every show you watch is trying to cram full-blown Christmas cavalcade down your gullet. But this is a season of Thanksgiving and meditation on those great, good gifts which we have received. It is a time of quiet, thoughtful joy, not bells pealing and hosannas shouting. What to do? Well, what I did was talked to my friend Dana Perino about it and good folks like you overheard. But the gold star goes to Laura Whitney of Paradise, Utah. A self-described “choir nerd,” she offered us an entire playlist of just this kind of music. Most of it is sacred, but it could be enjoyed by anyone. Really beautiful stuff. It included some of my favorites of all time – “It Is Well With My Soul,” “How Can I Keep From Singing?,” Beethoven’s “Eroica,” “Abide With Me” and the magnificent “Come Thou Fount Every Blessing.” The ever-obliging Brianna was kind enough to put it all into a Spotify playlist for us all to enjoy. Because of some platform issues we weren’t able to exactly replicate Ms. Whitney’s original on Spotify, and at least in one case I made the editorial decision to pick Johnny Cash’s version of “I’m Bound For The Promised Land.” But hey, it’s Johnny Cash. We hope you find it as delightful as we do. It will be something wonderful to listen as you are giving thanks and preparing to make merry.]

Goldberg believes that Devin Nunes and others on the right have tried to ""muddy the waters"" and say there's a lot more there there to Ukrainian meddling in the election. He also stands by his position that President Trump is guilty, but that doesn't necessarily mean he should be impeached. Goldberg said:

""I think Trump did it, I think he's absolutely guilty of pressuring Ukraine into a quid pro quo, now we can say what were the terms of the quid pro quo, was the aid part of it or not part of it? We can have those kinds of arguments, but it is just flatly obvious to me and to literally every Republican on the Hill I've talked to that he's guilty, that he did it.""

Goldberg also addressed Hunter Biden getting a pass and President Trump's ""obsession"" with him:

"" was just pissed off that he got tormented for two years and meanwhile Biden gets a free pass on all this. That's unfair and I get that okay. So lets assume you're absolutely right, it had absolutely nothing to do with 2020 and it just has to do with Trump's seething resentment that he got a hard time and Joe Biden didn't. That's not in the national interest either, that is indulging your pet grievances and holding up military aid and all these other things because you're ticked off and you're offended.""

Lastly, Goldberg stood by his position that President Trump only cares about corruption when it comes to Ukraine, saying ""he doesn't care about corruption anywhere else in the world.""

Graham’s letter, which was released as the final day of public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump wrapped up, asked Pompeo to release a series of documents and transcripts of conversations in 2016 between Biden and Poroshenko in relation to an investigation into the Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.

Burisma – and more specifically, Hunter Biden’s role on the company’s board of directors – has become one of the main talking points from Trump and the Republicans amid the impeachment inquiry into the president.

READ: GORDON SONDLAND'S IMPEACHMENT HEARING OPENING STATEMENT

Speaking on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Wednesday night, Graham said the phone calls between Biden and Poroshenko coincided with the time frame in which a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired.

“I want to know, are there any transcripts or readouts of the phone calls between the vice president and the president of Ukraine in February [2016] after the raid on the gas company president's house,” Graham said. “After this raid, Hunter Biden kicks in. Hunter Biden's business partner meets with [then-Secretary of State] John Kerry, and Vice President Biden on three occasions makes a phone call to the president of Ukraine and goes over there in March and they fire the guy, and this is the same man that the ambassador wanted investigated in 2015.”

Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings at a time when Hunter Biden sat on its board and while the vice president was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, many Western nations had supported Shokin’s firing.

Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, have been pushing Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to subpoena Hunter Biden.

Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., along with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, penned a scathing letter to Schiff in which they slammed the “sham ‘impeachment inquiry’” and notified the chairman of their intent to subpoena Biden and the whistleblower whose report sparked in the inquiry. Jordan, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, has been appointed as a temporary member of the House Intelligence Committee.

“The American people understand how you have affirmatively prevented Republicans from examining serious issues directly relevant to the issues,” the two GOP lawmakers told Schiff in their letter. “Therefore, to provide some basic level of fairness and objectivity to your ‘impeachment inquiry,’ we intend to subpoena the anonymous whistleblower and Hunter Biden for sworn testimony in closed-door depositions.”

The whistleblower last August reported that Trump had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch a public investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine—specifically, why the former vice president pressured Poroshenko to fire Shokin. The complaint questioned whether Trump withheld military aid and the opportunity of a White House meeting from Zelensky until Ukraine publicly announced an investigation into the Bidens. Trump and the White House repeatedly have denied the president did anything wrong.

On Wednesday, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland said he never heard directly from Trump on a quid pro quo linking military aid for Ukraine to politically advantageous investigations.

But, Sondland said, “we all understood” that a meeting at the White House for Ukraine’s president and a phone call with Trump would happen only if Zelensky agreed to an investigation into the 2016 U.S. election and the Bidens. And, he testified that he came to presume aid was linked to investigations too.

He said he sent an email on July 19, just days before the July 25 call at the center of the impeachment inquiry, in which he laid out the issue in detail to members of the State and Energy Departments and White House staff.

Sondland added: “It was no secret.”

The ""lengthy"" draft report ""concerns sensitive national security and law enforcement matters,"" Horowitz wrote in the letter, adding that he anticipated ""the final report will be released publicly with few redactions.""

Horowitz noted that he did not anticipate a need to prepare or issue ""separate classified and public versions of the report.""

""After we receive the final classification markings from the Department and the FBI, we will then proceed with our usual process for preparing a final report, including ensuring that appropriate reviews occur for accuracy and comment purposes,"" Horowitz wrote in the letter. ""Once begun, we do not anticipate the time for that review to be lengthy.""

BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENDS FUNDRAISING EMAIL CELEBRATING DEBATE PERFORMANCE HOURS BEFORE EVENT BEGINS

Graham further broke news on ""Hannity"" when he confirmed he is sending a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the transcripts of three phone calls the senator said then-Vice President Joe Biden had with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

Graham said the phone calls coincided with the time frame in which a Ukrainian prosecutor, once praised for going after the head of natural gas company Burisma Holdings – a person Graham said was known as the ""dirtiest guy in Ukraine"" by one top American official – was fired.

Burisma was the company on which Hunter Biden, the son of the 2020 Democratic candidate, sat on the board.

""I want to know are there any transcripts or readouts of the phone calls between the vice president and the president of Ukraine in February [2016] after the raid on the gas company president's house,"" said Graham.

Graham added he found it ""odd"" that instead of lauding the Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, for investigating the Burisma chairman, he was instead relieved of his duties.

He said that in 2015, President Obama's ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, said in a speech he wanted Shokin to be more forceful in his investigation of domestic corruption.

""The one person he named as being a sleazebag was the president of Burisma,"" Graham remarked.

Bribery. Contempt of Congress. Obstruction of justice.

Those are the four potential articles of impeachment that House Judiciary Committee Democrats could draw up against President Trump as soon as next month, Fox News is told, after all scheduled public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up on a testy note Thursday.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House on Thursday afternoon, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

It remained possible the House Intelligence Committee could schedule more hearings, although no additional hearings are expected during Thanksgiving week. Or, the committee could prepare a report on its findings for the House Judiciary Committee -- which would have the option of holding its own hearings or simply drafting articles of impeachment outright.

Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such hearings. But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

Graham, coming out of the White House discussion, added that ""we didn't talk about"" how to mount a case to ""defend the president.""

Instead, Graham said, the discussion centered around ""how would the trial start -- you know, they'll make a request for witnesses, but that would have to be granted by the Senate, I guess that's the way we did it before.""

Graham continued, ""My preference was to try to follow the Clinton model as much as possible.""

Clinton was acquitted on both perjury and obstruction counts in February 1999, with each vote falling fall short of the two-thirds majority required for removal.

In the Senate, impeachment procedures would allow witnesses to be called by the president's defense lawyers, GOP senators and a team of House Democrats who essentially would serve as prosecutors. The big catch: Republicans would need enough votes from the 53 GOP senators to muster a majority and prevent Democrats from blocking them.

Assuming Republican senators would stay united -- not a guarantee -- Trump's defenders could try refocusing the inquiry by seeking testimony from people like Hunter Biden, the son of 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

During his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to a whistleblower complaint touching off the impeachment inquiry, Trump suggested Zelensky investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine, including the former vice president's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid while the prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board.

Hunter Biden held that lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president. If Senate Republicans could put forward evidence showing the president's concerns about the Bidens' potential corruption were legitimate, they could undercut Democrats' central argument for impeachment.

On Thursday, Graham strongly signaled that Hunter Biden would be a key GOP focus. He sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents ""related to contacts between Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.""

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified behind closed doors last month that he and other officials had qualms about Hunter Biden's lucrative role on the board of Burisma at the time.

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS BIDEN, BURISMA NOT MENTIONED REGARDING AID HOLDUP

""What Republicans want to do is broaden the story,"" said David Hoppe, who was chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., during Clinton's impeachment trial.

And, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said Thursday he'd like Senate testimony from the still-anonymous whistleblower, whose House appearance Democrats have blocked. Cramer said he might also like to hear from both Bidens and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

The White House has signaled it will mount an aggressive defense. ""When this goes over to the Senate, you know, the people that actually started this thing, they are going to be put on the stand,"" Eric Trump, the president's son, told reporters Thursday. He said that would include ""heads of the Democratic Party.""

For his part, Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration.""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

The underwhelming televised event prompted Lahren to hold a vote, of sorts, among panelists on Fox Nation's ""Democratic Debate Reactions,"" asking them which they found ""more boring"" -- the debate or the House-led impeachment hearings.

""That's a tough one for the American people,"" replied Fox News contributor and Fox Nation host David Webb, saying the debate was, ""a repeat of the last debate and the prior debate and probably will be the next debate on December 19th.

""I think that they weren't really debating each other,"" he observed. ""They weren't countering each other, making their arguments, for their part, from their position.""

One of the biggest topics on the debate stage last night was health care, but even on that major issue Fox News contributor and retired U.S. Marine and Johnny ""Joey"" Jones argued that the candidates did not seem to be setting themselves apart.

""The only difference between a moderate Democrat and a progressive is, 'Is this Medicare-for-all with the mandate or Medicare-for-all without?' That's about the only difference at this point,"" he said.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said that they would eliminate private health care insurance plans immediately to make way for a single-payer health care system. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have said that they would keep private insurance plans for now. The remaining candidates have advocated for keeping private insurance while expanding public health insurance options.

Erin Elmore, who is a republican strategist and attorney, observed that these positions may present a huge electoral challenge for Democrats.

""Let's say Elizabeth Warren does get this nomination, her Medicare-for-all is toxic in the general. Absolutely toxic. You can't campaign on that against President Trump. And that's the issue here. Can any of these people make it against President Trump? And they don't have that 'It' factor,"" she said.

Webb told the Fox Nation panel: ""Fact is when you take federal spending as a percentage of GDP to that level where you cross the 47 percent line and over the 50 plus percent line, as other socialist democracies, you are a socialist nation. And that's where their spending would take us.""

Jones observed: ""This is why impeachment is so important for them, because they're fighting over who's going to get the consolation prize.

""They're fighting over who's going to be there when the Democrats in Congress beat Trump up so much that they believe the voters won't show up for him,"" he concluded. ""That's the only way they can beat him... and when Trump gets another win and another win between now and November next year, the only hope they have is to impeach him on emotion.""

""Well actually that was the first question of the night,"" observed Lahren, who pointed out that MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow asked former vice president Joe Biden to weigh in on the impeachment hearings, without pressing him on his relation to the scandal.

Webb expressed disbelief that the debate moderators failed to ask Biden a single question about his and his son, Hunter's, dealings in Ukraine.

""You also have to look at his potential problems with influence peddling,"" said Webb, ""We're talking about major issues where his son was involved while he was vice president. He was a member of the Senate, a member of that body. I'm not convicting him. I want the inquiry and the investigation to include him, which would, therefore, if he's innocent, exclude him.""

“On the one hand, it featured a fantastic all-woman moderation team, and on the other, it was hosted by a media company with serious problems related to workplace sexual assault and harassment,” UltraViolet Action co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement to Fox News.

NBC MUST CLEAN UP ‘TOXIC CULTURE,’ 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DEMAND AHEAD OF MSNBC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

“This debate was also defined by what was not addressed: workplace sexual abuse, and the fact that MSNBC, and its parent company Comcast/NBC Universal, have a serious problem with silencing survivors, enabling abuse, and creating a culture of impunity where employees were simply unsafe,” Thomas added.

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At one point, former Vice President Joe Biden missed an opportunity to bring attention to the issue during MSNBC’s debate.

“The #MeToo movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take, early in your administration, to address this problem?” NBC News' White House correspondent Kristen Welker asked Biden, setting up the 2020 presidential hopeful to call for changes at the Peacock Network.

The former vice president, who was not among the five candidates to sign a harshly worded letter demanding parent company Comcast to “prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC,” had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network but ultimately went a different direction.

MATT LAUER, NBC’S ‘TOXIC CULTURE’ LOOM OVER MSNBC’S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said “the culture of how women are treated” needs to change before repeatedly saying we need to keep “punching” at domestic violence. He appeared to believe that the #MeToo movement is focused on domestic violence, as opposed to sexual assault and harassment.

“No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman, in anger, other than in self-defense… we have to just change the culture, period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it,” Biden said as he punched the air, drawing a snicker from the audience.

“No, I really mean it,” Biden said, apparently unaware of the irony that evoked the laughter.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Earlier this week, Tom Steyer, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its “toxic culture” after a series of sexual harassment scandals related to Weinstein and Lauer.

UltraViolet helped putting the letter together and said Biden was invited to partake but ultimately didn’t sign it.

NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim, refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct. UltraViolet’s letter called on parent company Comcast to step in and “conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at NBC.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

But the message apparently fell on deaf ears and Lack dodged the subject when approached by Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple backstage during the debate.

Wemple, who attended the debate and bumped into Lack backstage, said he assumed the NBC News boss would “want to express his confidence in NBC News’s efforts to date” or even blow off some steam.

“Not so fast,” Wemple wrote, adding that Lack quickly shut down questions about conducting an investigation.

“I don’t have anything to say about it. . . . I don’t know much about it,” Lack told Wemple.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC’s high-level executives doesn’t think the network will take action anytime soon.

“Andy Lack is the Rasputin of network news. He has [NBC Universal CEO Steve] Burke and [Comcast CEO] Roberts so wrapped around his finger that God himself couldn’t force an independent investigation — which Andy knows would certainly result in his ouster,” the insider told Fox News."

We believe the person, who is not technically a whistleblower, should be required to testify before the House Intelligence Committee. Democrats who control the committee disagree. They killed a motion to subpoena the so-called whistleblower, who has said through his attorney that he wants to remain anonymous.

Here’s why the person filing the complaint should testify:

FBI REACHED OUT TO WHISTLEBLOWER'S LEGAL TEAM FOR INTERVIEW, SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS

Impeaching and removing a president is perhaps the most consequential thing Congress can do, short of declaring war. Impeachment and removal turns our representative democracy on its head, nullifying the last election.

In the case of a first-term president, impeachment deprives the American people of the chance to pass judgment on his actions and decide if they want to reelect him.

Impeachment is designed to be a constitutional failsafe, a measure of last resort to save the republic from imminent harm posed by the executive.

Public understanding of such a grave step and confidence in its legitimacy demand that Democrats show that the impeachment proceedings now underway are more than simply an exercise of raw partisan politics.

The American people need to know as much as possible about what the president is accused of. Yet the impeachment inquiry against Trump has been marked by secret proceedings, rules favoring one party over the other, and explosive accusations by people who may not even have firsthand knowledge. These are not the marks of a legitimate process. Indeed, they actively undercut the people’s trust.

As then-Sen. Joe Biden said during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998: “We in Congress had better be very careful before we upset [the people’s] decision and make darn sure … that our decision to impeach him was based on principle and not politics.”

Biden, who went on to become vice president and is now seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump for the presidency next year, was right 21 years ago and his position is the right one today. Not surprisingly, Democrats are far more eager to impeach Republican Trump than they were to impeach Democrat Clinton.

As the House moves toward what appears to be Trump’s likely impeachment (followed by his likely acquittal in a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate), Democrats will need to gather all the facts and present them openly and honestly to the American people.

That means that the complainant needs to answer important questions like:

How did you learn about the Trump-Zelensky call?

Did you have any firsthand information?

Who provided you with second-hand information?

Why did you think this person or persons were trustworthy?

Did the accounts you heard from those sources differ from the memorandum of the call released by the president?

Many more questions need to be asked, of course.

The complainant’s attorneys have said he is willing to answer questions in writing, but that’s not sufficient. The American people need to weigh his credibility. Pieces of paper can’t answer questions.

And there are a lot of questions. As the intelligence community Inspector General noted, the complainant had significant ties to one of the current Democratic presidential candidates.

According to some media reports, the complainant is a registered Democrat who worked for then-Vice President Biden in addition to former CIA Director John Brennan and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice.

If any of these and other unverified reports about the so-called whistleblower are true, then there is good reason to think the complainant is more like a partisan double agent than a true whistleblower.

And especially because it appears the complainant lacked firsthand knowledge of the events he complained about, there’s the question of who did. And why did they seek him out to pass their information along?

Motive matters. If impeachment is to be anything other than a partisan assault on our democracy, a bipartisan consensus must agree that politics was not the animating factor behind the complaint as well as the subsequent impeachment inquiry.

Current House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., had some good advice back in 1998, when he was already serving in the House.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

“There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment, when impeachment is supported by one of our major political parties and opposed by the other,” Nadler said 21 years ago. “Such an impeachment will produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come and will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions.”

Congress should heed that old but wise and very relevant advice of Joe Biden and Jerrold Nadler today.

308,Mary Anne Marsh,"After a day of impeachment hearings with some devastating developments for President Trump, the fifth Democratic debate opened Wednesday night in Atlanta with everyone seeming a bit more nervous than usual, but then quickly settled into candidates delivering … [+6230 chars]",Here are the biggest winners and losers from the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night.,2019-11-21,Fox News,Mary Anne Marsh: Fifth Democratic debate's big winners and surprising losers,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/fifth-democratic-debate-winners-losers-mary-anne-marsh,"After a day of impeachment hearings with some devastating developments for President Trump, the fifth Democratic debate opened Wednesday night in Atlanta with everyone seeming a bit more nervous than usual, but then quickly settled into candidates delivering their respective campaign messages.

While many expected the debate to focus attacks on the front runners – including the newly minted member of the club, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg – that didn’t happen.

However, Sen. Kamala Harris of California delivered a prosecutorial dissection of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that was the attack everyone will remember, after the latter criticized the Democratic Party and Harris brought the receipts that Gabbard was never really a member of it.

RISING BUTTIGIEG FENDS OFF ATTACKS, TAKES ON FAR-LEFT FLANK AT DEM DEBATE; BIDEN STUMBLES

Here are the night’s biggest winners and losers:

WINNERS

BIGGEST WINNER: Amy Klobuchar

Overall, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the winner of the contest than ran over two hours. She had her best performance by emphasizing her experience, productivity, electoral successes. She also emphasized the fact that women are judged by a different standard than men, citing her criticism of Buttigieg’s lack of experience while he was being hailed as a front-runner last week.

Klobuchar pulled it all together in Atlanta with a number of great points and lines -- many familiar -- but then she delivered the line of the night, ""If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."" Klobuchar isn’t a front runner and this debate won’t make her one. But, the senator will get another look from voters due to it and that puts her in a better position coming out of the debate than going into it.

SURPRISE WINNER: Joe Biden

Former Vice President Biden is a winner by default. Hiding in plain sight might be the best strategy for him. Biden didn’t have the mistake laden performance of past debates by receding for long stretches in the debate. Still holding on to a national lead, that strategy Wednesday night will help him hold on to it for a bit longer. Biden largely relied on his message that he can beat Trump, has the experience, and can bring people together. That might be enough, for now, to keep him in the post position but it’s not going to win the nomination without a better performance in future debates and on the campaign trail.

SURPRISE WINNER: Kamala Harris

Harris had her best performance in a long time. She went after Trump and Gabbard making the case against both in her best prosecutorial fashion. Harris may never match the electric moment she had when she went after Biden in an earlier debate, but she turned in her best performance since that one by mixing moxie and policy positions. That allows Harris to play for another day when she’s been skating at the edge of collapse. A lack of consistency has bedeviled her candidacy. But on Wednesday night she was the candidate everyone expected her to be in this campaign.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Tulsi Gabbard

Running to be the Democratic nominee and criticizing the Democratic Party is not a winning strategy. Gabbard’s criticism of the Party may have been her way of setting up a run as an independent in the general election. Instead, Harris disqualified her for both contests by reciting her embrace of Trump and dictators since the 2016 election. Gabbard then turned her aim on Buttigieg at the end of the debate in yet another curious attack on other Democratic candidates that has been a hallmark of her candidacy.

LOSER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg was the loser in Atlanta. He had the most to gain yet missed the opportunity to set himself apart from the front tier of candidates and generate even more of the momentum initiated by the latest polls. Buttigieg still struggles to address matters of race and that was no different on Wednesday night. The fact that Buttigieg couldn’t make the most of the debate on Wednesday night could foreshadow his ability to put the race away later in the campaign. It is his second turn in the spotlight and under the stage lights on Wednesday night he didn’t shine. Instead, Buttigieg turned in a serviceable appearance at best, missing an opportunity he’s unlikely to get again -- a hot hand going into a debate as a new front-runner.

LOSER: Elizabeth Warren

Debates have been Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bread and butter. No one has more plans, policies, or points and makes them better than Warren…but not on Wednesday night. For some reason, Warren didn’t have it. She made better points with more detail than any of the other candidates but her delivery and presence were off. A performance like those from her other debates would have helped Warren stem a tough week or two of poll numbers in early primary states. Instead, she will have to hit the trail to do it until the next debate.

LOSER: Bernie Sanders

The independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t do anything to help himself on Wednesday night. Same lines, same attacks, same Bernie Sanders. His performance means that Sanders won’t turn his drop in the polls around with the Atlanta debate. He has plenty of money to stay in the race for months to come. But, that doesn’t mean he’s going to win a contest in the process and that’s why debates like the one on Wednesday night matter.

LOSER: Cory Booker

In every debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has a moment…and that’s it. It’s just a moment. That’s not enough for him or his candidacy to make a move. Booker’s performance Wednesday night isn’t going to move the polls for him and it’s unlikely he is going do anything else at this point that will do it.

LOSERS: Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang

Neither entrepreneur Andrew Yang nor billionaire activist Tom Steyer were able to make a real mark in this debate to make a move in the polls with voters. Steyer resorted to reciting lines from his TV ads during much of the debate. Yang had a few good lines. But, at this point, that’s a costly missed opportunity for both candidates.

LOSER: Deval Patrick

The late entrant into the 2020 Democratic race, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick not only didn’t make the debate stage he also canceled an event he organized at Morehouse College in Atlanta, the site of the debate, when only two people showed up."

“You know, I look at broadband the way I think people decades ago -- the 20s, 30s -- looked at electricity,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in Des Moines this month. ""Broadband is a basic necessity of life today."" He added, ""If you don't have quality broadband, no one is going to come into that town.""

INDEPENDENTS SOURING ON IMPEACHMENT AS INQUIRY HEATS UP, POLLS INDICATE

Some candidates are promising that, if elected, they would expand it rapidly over the next four years.

""I pledge to you, as your president I will make sure that we connect all the households with raw broadband by 2022,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a recent meet and greet in Wisconsin.

The state of Georgia is notorious for its slow connectivity in rural areas and local elected officials are making it a key issue and highlighting their constituents’ concerns.

“What we’ve heard a lot of families have to drive into town....and they have to go and sit in a Chick-fil-A or a Starbucks cafe somewhere where they can get public Wi-Fi,"" said Steve Gooch, a Republican state senator in Georgia.

He added: ""The kids have to come into town to get access to internet.""

Among the candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden is calling for $20 billion in broadband spending, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $85 billion and Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for $80 billion. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already spends $4.5 billion a year on broadband.

Buttigieg has called for a public option for broadband, Warren wants to give local municipalities more control over their own broadband networks and Biden wants to extend service to tribal areas and offer subsidies to rural Americans to get better internet.

But the intractable issue has long been an unwillingness for large tech conglomerates to do the heavy lifting themselves.

“You run into this problem with private organizations where it is difficult for them from a financial perspective to justify the costs in those areas,” said tech expert Russell Holly.

Increasing access to rural broadband could be part of the Democratic strategy to woo those who might have voted for President Trump in 2016. But for those who study voting behavior, they are skeptical. The tangible advantages of infrastructure reform are not immediate.

“It’s going to be several years before we start to see this impact, whereas what are the issues that are going to strike the pocketbook within the next twelve months, I think that’s going to strike a nerve with voters,” said Emory Business School professor David Schweidel.

But without high-speed internet, the knowledge available to rural voters is limited once in the run-up to an election. Voters may not see hardly any of the digital ads candidates spend millions of dollars on. Logistically, getting the word out about polling location changes could hinder turnout.

“Just being able to share that information in a way that affects a large group of people is easier in a larger city where there’s faster internet access,” said Holly.

The digital divide does happen to be narrowing, according to the FCC.

The percentage of the population with access to broadband has increased from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 93.5 percent in 2017.

Whether voters enter the ballot box with the issue on their mind remains to be seen.

“I haven’t heard of a life or death situation yet, but I think there are situations where...people can’t get access to a telephone or a call into a 911 center...but it’s more of a nuisance,” said Gooch."

I know this because I came of age during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. As a young woman, I found myself confronted by adult topics – things you can’t unlearn and certainly don’t want to learn or think about regarding the president of the United States.

Coverage of the Clinton sex scandal and impeachment was incessant and all-consuming. Details of sex acts were thrown around casually. And the scandal, which fundamentally involved inappropriate behavior by a much older man, came to be known by the name of the young victim rather than the victimizer.

DEROY MURDOCK: IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, DEMOCRATS IGNORE UKRAINIAN DENIALS OF PRESSURE BY TRUMP

Years later, I worked in Democratic politics for then-Sen. Barack Obama in his campaign for president. It was so clear to me how wrong President Clinton’s actions had been – and equally how much partisanship polluted the moment.

Working with young Democrats on a hope-filled presidential campaign, and then in the White House for President Obama, I understood that a married leader having an affair with his or her 20-something intern was unacceptable. A situation like that involves an abuse of power. And no one – especially not the president of the United States – should engage in that type of misbehavior.

It can make you uncomfortable among Democrats, in a party dominated by the Clinton family for so long, to acknowledge this fundamental truth. But wanting your “team” to win shouldn’t shift your fundamental beliefs in morality and right and wrong.

I wonder about Republicans. How many of them have partisan blinders up, as many Democrats did, 21 years ago? Will any of them who are clearly uncomfortable with President Trump’s behavior stand up against what I and millions of other Americans see as his abuse of power?

Today I’m watching with a new lens as the impeachment hearings for President Trump unfold. I am now a mother with a young son and a former White House staffer. I saw the power of the presidency up close and I understand the gravity of every decision the leader in that office makes.

I wonder about Republicans. How many of them have partisan blinders up, as many Democrats did, 21 years ago? Will any of them who are clearly uncomfortable with President Trump’s behavior stand up against what I and millions of other Americans see as his abuse of power?

If you look at President Trump as objectively as possible, without political bias, you’ll see that it’s been clearly established that he paid two women for their silence about their claims that they had extramarital affairs with him – though Trump denies any sexual relationship with either woman.

Hearing Trump’s denials reminded me of President Clinton famous statement – “I did not have sexual relations with that woman” – before he was impeached in the House but acquitted in the Senate and allowed to remain in office. That will likely turn out to be Trump’s fate as well.

Take a closer look and you’ll also see that six former employees and associates of President Trump – who purports to support law and order – have been convicted of felonies since he took office. And you’ll see that Special Counsel Robert Mueller didn’t clear Trump of accusations of obstruction of justice – Mueller simply reached no conclusion because a sitting president can’t be indicted under Justice Department policy.

And now comes the Ukraine scandal, where – in my opinion and the opinion of many others – President Trump illegally pressured the president of Ukraine and withheld nearly $400 million in vital assistance to Ukraine for his own political benefit.

Trump clearly wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden – Trump’s potential opponent his the 2020 presidential election. Trump also wanted Ukraine to investigate a baseless claim that Ukraine interfered in our 2016 presidential election on behalf of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

All that’s at issue is whether Trump demanded these actions by Zelensky in return for U.S. aid to defend against Russian military aggression, or whether Trump just said it would be nice if Zelensky did these things as “a favor.”

Incredibly, Trump told reporters at the White House just recently that he still wants Ukraine to conduct an investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and also wants China to investigate Hunter Biden for his business dealings. Despite his many denials, it’s obvious to me and many others that this amounts to Trump inviting Ukraine and China to interfere in our 2020 election.

But so many Republicans keep defending Trump, trying to justify actions I consider unjustifiable.

President Trump is a showman. He knows how to control a camera and how to stir partisan passions.

Just as President Clinton did in the 1990s, President Trump controls the biggest bully pulpit in the land. Republican elected officials and candidates for elected office know their chances of winning elections often depend on a presidential endorsement. But I also believe that many of them have a feeling about Trump like I had about President Clinton during his sex scandal: what the president did was wrong.

President Trump prioritized himself over our national security – willingly endangering our ally Ukraine for his own political benefit. This is why the House is considering impeaching him.

Sometimes our partisan goggles get in the way when elected officials engage in all sorts of misconduct, including illegal activity, as well as what we should all agree are violations of moral and ethical standards.

These partisan goggles cloud our judgement and get us to excuse the inexcusable. Years later, that clouded judgement doesn’t look so good anymore.

President Trump continues to undermine our national security, endangering us all. The dangerous path he treads might seem amusing to some. But his disdain for our allies, his disrespect for our own national security officials and diplomats, and his pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent and his son are unacceptable conduct for any president, regardless of political party.

Turner confronted Holmes about his testimony that he overheard a phone conversation between Sondland and Trump a day after the controversial July 25 phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry into alleged quid pro quo dealings between Trump and Ukraine.

Holmes said Trump was talking loud enough over the phone that he could hear the president say, ""So, he's gonna do the investigation?"" referring to Zelensky opening up an investigation into the Ukraine business dealings of 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Holmes then said he heard Sondland reply, ""He's gonna do it,"" and tell the president that Zelensky ""loves your a--"" and would do ""anything you ask him to.""

Turner did not ask any questions to Holmes or Fiona Hill, a former top National Security Council who also appeared for testimony on the fifth day of public impeachment inquiry hearings, but instead lambasted the diplomat for his account of what he heard.

""Mr. Holmes, that information had nothing whatsoever to do with the subject matter of any of these hearings. It was anecdotal, it was extraneous. Your statements that your interests are protecting Ukraine are very dubious when you embarrass President Zelensky by making those statements you didn’t have to make,"" Turner said.

""Who cares that Ambassador Sondland said that?

According to reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, Lack and NBC News president Noah Oppenheim were directly implicated in the stonewalling of Farrow's harrowing report on Weinstein's sexual predation and discovered that the disgraced film mogul was trying to leverage Lauer's own scandal over the network.

Amid the fallout of Farrow's reporting, there had been growing calls for NBC News to conduct an outside investigation into the allegations surrounding Lauer, the former ""Today"" host. Earlier this week, presidential candidates Tom Steyer and Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its ""toxic culture,"" ahead of Wednesday night's MSNBC debate.

""Given all that activity, surely Lack would want to express his confidence in NBC News's efforts to date, to repudiate Farrow’s reporting and/or to let off some righteous steam? Not so fast,"" Wemple wrote.

Wemple wrote that Lack ""dodged"" his questions about the growing calls for an outside investigation.

Former Vice President Joe Biden had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network when asked about how he would carry on the #MeToo movement as president at the MSNBC debate, but he ultimately went a different direction.

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said ""the culture of how women are treated"" needed to change before saying, ""We have to... keep punching"" at domestic violence.

But the tables could turn, should the House approve impeachment articles and trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. There, Trump’s allies are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats.

""Frankly, I want a trial,"" Trump declared Friday on “Fox & Friends.”

TRUMP CALLS FOR SENATE TRIAL, SEEKS WHISTLEBLOWER AND SCHIFF AS IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES

There’s a reason for that.

Democrats have controlled everything during marathon proceedings in the House, frustrating GOP attempts to call witnesses pertaining to the matters Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate -- specifically, the Bidens’ business dealings in that country and Kiev’s alleged interference in the 2016 election.

But that changes on the Senate side, where Republicans have the majority and Trump allies chair key committees. Already, they’ve signaled their interest in exploring issues that House Democrats glossed over during their hearings.

On Thursday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between former Vice President Joe Biden and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

This pertains to questions surrounding the elder Biden’s role in pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the natural gas firm Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board. Biden denies any wrongdoing, but Republicans have pressed for details throughout the impeachment process, in a bid to show that even though Trump’s pressure campaign on Kiev triggered the impeachment inquiry, his concern was legitimate.

On the House side, Republicans likewise encountered challenges digging into allegations of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election. While Trump has sought to press an unsupported theory that Ukraine was tied to Democratic National Committee hacking, GOP lawmakers have sought details on other issues that are more grounded in published reports -- like whether former DNC consultant Alexandra Chalupa was improperly digging up dirt on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and others with Ukraine’s help at the time.

Democrats did not grant GOP requests to call Biden's son Hunter, Chalupa and others on the House side.

But while it’s unclear if Senate Republicans will at least attempt to call these and other witnesses, high-ranking members are showing their early interest in exploring the issues.

Aside from the Graham letter, Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have penned a letter to the head of the National Archives and Records Administration to request records of multiple White House meetings that took place in 2016 involving Obama administration officials, Ukrainian government representatives and Democratic National Committee officials.

GRAHAM DEMANDS DOCUMENTS ON UKRAINE, BIDENS, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FROM 2016

Johnson and Grassley wrote that during a meeting in 2016, officials “brought up investigations relating to Burisma Holdings.” The senators added that a Ukrainian political officer working in the Ukraine Embassy in Washington said U.S. officials in that meeting asked that ""Kiev drop the Burisma probe and allow the FBI to take it over.”

They added that White House records revealed that Chalupa had attended “numerous meetings at the White House, including one event with President Obama.”

The new requests from Senate Republicans come as the House ended its series of scheduled hearings on Thursday. The Intelligence Committee could announce additional hearings and depositions, but at this time, nothing has been scheduled.

The committee may now write and transmit its report to the House Judiciary Committee, which could begin writing articles of impeachment ahead of a floor vote.

“What the House ends up passing will drive a lot of what we end up doing over here,” a senior Republican aide familiar with the ongoing discussions told Fox News Friday.

The aide told Fox News that the White House made a “positive” and “significant” development this week, as officials indicated “what they want” for the trial.

In the Senate trial, three separate parties have input to how it will play out: Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats and the White House.

“It is impossible for us to come up with contours for impeachment without input from the White House,” the aide said. “Their input is a very positive step so we can try to control this as much as possible.”

The White House, on Thursday, signaled that they would like a Senate trial to last no longer than two weeks. The impeachment of former President Bill Clinton lasted for six weeks.

“We all want speedy,” the aide said. “This is the first indication the White House has given and that’s a positive — before it was radio silence from them, and now they’re starting to indicate what they want this thing to look like.”

The aide explained that the Senate, once they receive articles of impeachment, will begin working on two resolutions — one that governs the timeline of the trial, and the other that sets up witnesses for closed-door depositions, as well as which witness will be required to testify on the stand.

The aide explained that the resolutions are “significant,” noting that they will “be the main avenue that evidence is admitted.”

The aide suggested that Republican senators like Graham, Grassley and Johnson could be attempting to help “shape” the witness list and the trial.

A senior administration official, though, claimed Friday there’s “ample reasons” for the Senate to simply dismiss the case – though GOP senators have indicated that’s unlikely to happen.

Yet the official still maintained it’s “100 percent to our advantage to have [a] full trial” in the Senate.

Meanwhile, Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said sending articles of impeachment to the Senate was ""good news.""

“Everyone knows what they’re going to do next. They’re going to impeach the president and send it onto the Senate, but that is the good news. That’s good news,” Stewart said. “In the U.S. Senate, there won’t be any secret testimony or dishonest leadership … or to deny a defense.”

He added: “So we’ll finally be able to get to the truth.”

Stewart went on to list several witnesses he hoped the Senate would call to testify, including the whistleblower, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Hunter Biden, Burisma board member Devon Archer, Chalupa, and Fusion GPS researcher Nellie Ohr.

And the president, himself, seems to be welcoming the trial as well.

“There’s nothing there,” Trump said Friday during an interview with “Fox & Friends,” saying “there should never be an impeachment,” and echoing GOP requests for the whistleblower, Schiff and Hunter Biden to appear as witnesses.

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Kiev. That call prompted the whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. Trump challenged the accuracy of the complaint, though the transcript released by the White House did support the core allegations that he pressed for politically related investigations.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement. Trump denies any wrongdoing."

“What they’re really saying to voters is you can’t actually make changes to American policy, the ones that we support,” said the host of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

Carlson went on to explain that the removal of Trump from the White House would preserve the status quo, which he said enriches ""private equity managers, defense contractors, and parasites of the vast federal bureaucracy.”

JORDAN SLAMS SONDLAND FOR OMITTING TRUMP’S ‘NO QUID PRO QUO’ CLAIM FROM STATEMENT

“Will they have learned anything from the [impeachment] exercise? Will the 2016 election have changed their minds or their priorities at all in any way or will they continue to console themselves that the whole thing was just some weird aberration run by Russia and racists in the heartland?” Carlson asked rhetorically, adding: “If the people in charge were capable of learning anything, our country wouldn’t look like what it does today.""

Carlson spoke after the fourth day of impeachment hearings by the House Intelligence Committee, which featured testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.

KEN STARR ON GORDON SONDLAND'S IMPEACHMENT HEARING TESTIMONY: 'ONE OF THOSE BOMBSHELL DAYS'

Sondland testified that he and others in the administration understood that a meeting at the White House and a phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky would happen only if Zelensky agreed to an investigation into the 2016 U.S. election and the son of former Vice President Joe Biden. However, Sondland also testified that he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine during a phone conversation Sept. 9, to which Trump responded: ""I want nothing. I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing

Trump insisted Wednesday that Sondland's testimony means ""it's all over"" for the inquiry

“From the beginning, Washington has had presumptions about what the new president was like, about what policy voters were allowed to choose,” Carlson said. “Voters weren’t allowed to end foreign wars by casting a ballot or put America first or to secure America’s borders.

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,"" Obama said. He said Americans ""like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.""

It seems clear that President Obama was directing his comments at the two farthest-left major Democratic presidential candidates – Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont – as well as the four freshmen congresswomen collectively known as “the Squad.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON’T WANT TO ‘TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM’

Obama is right. We had an American Revolution in 1776 that changed history for the better and gave birth to our great nation. But many Americans are alarmed by talk of a second revolution that will move America so far left that millions of people will feel left out.

Americans want sound solutions – not simply solutions that sound good – that will make major improvements to our country. But they want the equivalent of a home remodeling for our nation’s government – not a demolition that will blow up what works as well as what needs replacing.

You can be sure that President Trump will work to demonize whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him next year. Trump will call his opponent a wild-eyed socialist who will raise taxes sky-high on everyone, impose crazy new regulations, destroy our economy and take away our freedoms. Democrats need to nominate someone who can show such Trump claims are nonsense, and can appeal to centrist voters as well as those on the far left.

The polls back up Obama’s advice for Democrats to avoid extremism.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is surging in the polls in the nomination race because he is seen as progressive but not radical by many voters. The 37-year-old military veteran is seen as the future of the Democratic Party by many – and if he doesn’t get the nomination next year has plenty of time to compete in the years ahead.

Buttigieg has taken sizeable leads over the other top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders – in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first two nominating contests will be held in February. A lot can change between now the first votes, but Mayor Pete is clearly a strong contender.

Like Biden and many of the second-tier candidates, Buttigieg is taking the path recommended by Obama – seeking evolution rather than revolution.

While the revolutionary faction of the Democratic Party wants ""Medicare-for-all,"" Buttigieg favors Medicare “for all who want it.” Under this plan, people who want to keep their employer-provided health insurance can do so. But an affordable, comprehensive public alternative for health insurance would be available for all who want it.

When it comes to guns, Mayor Pete supports a voluntary gun buyback program that voters have voiced strong support for. He rejects mandatory confiscation of assault weapons, like the plan proposed by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas. That idea was so unpopular it may have contributed to O’Rourke’s decision to end his presidential candidacy not long after he proposed it.

On the issue of immigration, Buttigieg again sides with the majority of voters. He wants citizenship for Dreamers – immigrants brought to the U.S. without legal authorization as children. About 77 percent of voters favor this sensible plan

At the same time, Buttigieg wants to enforce our immigration laws, but with less severe penalties and without separating immigrant children from their parents. And the mayor rejects calls from some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. He understands our immigration problems are being caused by the wrong policies, not by the people who enforce those policies.

Like Biden and some candidates in the back of the pack of Democratic contenders, Buttigieg wants to fix what’s broken in our country and unite us around our common goals and aspirations – the exact opposite of what President Trump has tried to do by fanning the flames of division and spewing hateful rhetoric in his speeches and tweets.

Not too long ago, “experts” thought a black presidential candidate couldn’t be elected until the far future. Barack Obama waged a brilliant presidential campaign and proved them wrong, and then won reelection against all odds. So he has the best credentials of anyone to know what Democrats need to do to send Trump into a well-deserved political retirement.

There are no silver medals for the second-place finishers in presidential elections. The losing candidate can write a book about what might have been, but can’t accomplish anything for the American people. All his or her brilliant plans will amount to nothing.

Democrats need to focus on the need to defeat President Trump as their top priority. To do this they have to nominate a pragmatic candidate who can appeal to moderate Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans turned off by Trump’s conduct in office.

Democratic candidates need to remember that Obama got to the White House by calling for change – not revolution.

“In my view there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law,” Schiff, D-Calif., said, referring to the claim that Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and withheld military aid as an incentive.

“We are better than that,” Schiff concluded as he struck a gavel in dramatic fashion.

FIONA HILL SAYS SHE WAS GIVEN STEELE DOSSIER JUST BEFORE IT WAS PUBLISHED

Schiff also slammed Republican arguments, saying it was ""clear to everyone"" that aid was withheld from Ukraine on the condition of opening investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Furthermore, he said Republicans' chracterization of testimony in the impeachment hearings as ""hearsay"" is ""absurd.""

""That would be like saying you can't rely on the testimony of the burglars during Watergate because it's only hearsay,” he said. “Or you can’t consider the fact that they tried to break in because they got caught. They actually didn’t get what they came for so no harm no foul. That’s absurd.”

Schiff’s remarks came as Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee made their closing arguments to wrap up the final impeachment hearing of the week. It may, in fact, have been the final hearing in the Houe impeachment inquiry before the matter is turned over to the chamber's Judiciary Committee.

IMPEACHMENT WITNESS FIONA HILL ONCE OPPOSED SENDING LETHAL AID TO UKRAINE IN FIGHT WITH RUSSIA

In his 20-minute speech, Schiff laid out what the committee has learned over the course of seven hearings on President Trump’s conduct with Ukraine, including details about the smear campaign against a “dedicated public servant,” former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, and Trump's desire to have Ukraine investigate Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings and the Bidens.(Hunter had a seat on the company's board.)

“He [Trump] has to smear and destroy those who get in his way and someone fighting corruption in Ukraine was getting in his way so she’s [Yovanovitch is] gone,” Schiff said Thursday.

He said Democrats will have to examine “what is our duty” as they decide on next steps.

California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the panel, called the hearings “a show trial” and said they had a pre-determined verdict.

Trump, who calls Schiff “the most dishonest man in politics,” has repeatedly blasted the lawmaker.

On Wednesday, Trump called Schiff as a ""corrupt politician,"" telling reporters the congressman ""stands up and he tells lies all day long. .. We have no due process.""

On Thursday, the president directly attacked the congressman on Twitter. ""No pressure on Ukraine,"" he said, referring to allegations of a quid pro quo. ""Great corruption & dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!""

Schiff has accused Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo in pushing for Ukraine to investigate Burisma, the Bidens, and allegations that Ukraine, and not Russia, had attempted to meddle in American elections in 2016.

Schiff said Trump's actions were a ""conditioning of official acts for something of great value to the president. These political investigations -- it goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery as well as other potential high crimes or misdemeanors.""

A statement from Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director, released Thursday said, “Adam Schiff has turned the House Intelligence Committee into an arm of the Democratic National Committee, and despite that has managed to produce no evidence at all that President Trump did anything wrong.”

He was joined by several other candidates on stage in going after the health care overhaul, putting the party's far-left candidates on their heels over what Buttigieg called their ""divisive"" and unrealistic approach.

Reflecting the ever-shifting dynamic in the race, meanwhile, Joe Biden had a mixed performance -- projecting foreign policy strength and siding with Buttigieg against the liberal wing on health care, while also suffering some stumbles on the debate stage. Until recently the unrivaled front-runner in the race, Biden competed for attention Wednesday with three other top-tier candidates -- Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg -- but flubbed when he erroneously stated in front of Sen. Kamala Harris that he had the support of the ""only"" black woman elected to the Senate.

In an odd moment, he also said it's important to ""keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, noting that it's ""rarely"" needed for men to hit women in self-defense.

The debate was the candidates' first meeting since Warren said she would gradually guide the nation toward Medicare-for-all, supposedly paid for with a host of tax hikes on the rich and other measures. One by one, several of the candidates -- including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- raised objections to that plan.

""I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said at one point.

Buttigieg called for health care reform ""without the divisive step of ordering people onto it,"" saying that ""commanding people to accept that option"" is not the right approach.

""We have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize, not polarize, that majority,"" the South Bend mayor said.

And, in a particularly spirited moment, New Jersey Sen. Booker directly took on Warren's proposed wealth tax, saying it would be ineffective as a means of funding her Medicare-for-all plan, along with her proposals to provide free college tuition and erasing student loan debt.

Democrats need to be focused on growing wealth, Booker said, not simply taxing it. Republicans have asserted that, even if all billionaires were somehow taxed out of existence without causing any capital markets distortion, the resulting revenues in the best case scenario would barely pay for three years of Medicare-for-all. (The world's 2,150 billionaires have an approximate combined net worth of $8.7 trillion, and the progressive Urban Institute has said that Medicare-for-all would cost on average $10.2 trillion for three years.)

WHAT HAPPENED IN TODAY'S BLOCKBUSTER IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY?

Vermont Sen. Sanders, who is arguing for a more immediate shift to a single-payer system, separately sparred with Biden on the issue. Biden argued that Medicare-for-all could not pass Congress, in part because it would force people to lose their private insurance.

""I trust the American people to make a judgment about what is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies want,"" Biden said. He continued to push for modifications to Obama-era health care reforms instead.

On foreign policy, Biden sounded an authoritative note, declaring that he would restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We have to speak loudly on violations of human rights,"" he said, unequivocally holding Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman responsible for Khashoggi's death.

Later, in a somewhat awkward moment, Biden prompted some laughter in the audience when he declared that ""we gotta keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, and that it is only acceptable to hit a woman in ""self-defense,"" which he said would ""rarely"" occur.

And, Biden asserted that he had the support of ""the only African-American woman who’s ever been elected to the United States Senate"" -- prompting Booker and Harris to dryly remark, ""That's not true.""

Harris noted, “The other one is here.” Biden later corrected himself to say he had the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, referring to former Illinois Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley Braun.

In another notable one-on-one moment, Sanders, touting the benefits of socialism in a discussion with billionaire Tom Steyer, argued that America only has ""eight or nine"" years left to reverse catastrophic effects of climate change, including cities going ""underwater."" United Nations experts made similar claims all the way back in 1989.

As the heated discussion unfolded at the MSNBC debate in Atlanta, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- who was recently accused by Hillary Clinton of being a ""Russian asset"" -- offered a blunt assessment: ""Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,"" she said.

Gabbard also doubled down on earlier comments that Clinton represents the “personification of the rot in the Democratic Party.” She said the party is influenced by a “foreign policy establishment” that supports regime-change wars. She called it the “Bush, Clinton, Trump foreign policy doctrine.” (Harris then attacked Gabbard for appearing on Fox News.)

Separately, Gabbard unloaded on Buttigieg after he attacked her for a widely-panned meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of war crimes.

""You would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends,"" Gabbard shot back, noting that former President John F. Kennedy met with his counterpart in the Soviet Union.

Klobuchar also pointedly criticized Buttigieg, arguing that he ""said the right words"" as a ""local official"" but lacks needed experience.

""I actually have the experience,"" Klobuchar remarked.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" Buttigieg retorted. ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Meanwhile, Warren unloaded on U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland just hours after his explosive impeachment hearing testimony, saying at Wednesday night's primary debate that he bought his position ""by writing a check for $1 million"" to Trump's inaugural committee.

Warren vowed that if she were elected, ""We are not going to give the ambassador posts to the highest bidder"" -- signaling that the Massachusetts Democratic senator would use the proceedings to advance her outsider message.

However, The Washington Free Beacon noted that Warren repeatedly voted to confirm several of former President Barack Obama's donors to ambassadorships, even when they lacked relevant experience. And, Warren did not object to Sonland's confirmation at the time.

""Read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that show how the president tried to obstruct justice,"" Warren said. ""We have to establish the principle that no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.""

Others on stage also slammed President Trump over the impeachment proceedings.

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris, D-Calif., declared. Citing Sondland's claim that everyone was ""in the loop"" on Ukraine talks at the heart of the probe, she said ""that means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president"" and other top officials.

Not everyone on stage committed to voting to convict the president if he were impeached, however. Klobuchar suggested she wanted Trump removed, but emphasized the importance of seeing all the evidence.

""I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct. ... I just believe our jurors is to look at each count and make a decision,"" Klobuchar said, before saying that Trump repeatedly ""puts his own private interests ... in front of our country's interest.""

The debate's initial attention on Trump and Medicare-for-all took some heat off Buttigieg, at least for the debate's beginning moments. His dramatic rise from little-known Indiana mayor to a leading Democratic presidential candidate faced its toughest test on Wednesday, with rivals eager to stall his momentum.

Harris and Buttigieg engaged in a tense but respectful conversation later on in the evening, as Harris discussed the importance of not taking ""women of color"" for granted.

""I do sometimes feel like a stranger in my own country,"" Buttigieg, who is openly gay, remarked.

The debate in Atlanta marked the first time Buttigieg faced other White House hopefuls as an undisputed member of the top tier.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The 37-year old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, gained significant ground in recent months in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February. He is bunched at the top of most polls in Iowa with candidates who have much longer political resumes.

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

Some surveys are beginning to show him taking a more convincing lead in the race, at least in early-voting states.

Buttigieg still faces plenty of hurdles to clinching the Democratic nomination, particularly winning over black and other minority voters. But his Iowa rise means he could come under fire from his rivals like never before.

Biden, Warren and Sanders have all faced similar scrutiny in previous debates, and those attacks did little to change the trajectory of the race.

The debate unfolded at a moment of uncertainty about the Democratic field, with some in the party, particularly donors, worried there’s no one positioned to defeat President Trump. Former President Barack Obama took the unusual step last week of warning the party against moving too far to the left.

Speaking to that anxiety, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the Democratic race last week. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is openly flirting with a bid.

Neither Patrick nor Bloomberg were onstage Wednesday.

With less than three months before voting, much of the nation’s political attention would typically be focused on the primary. Instead, the focus is on the impeachment inquiry against Trump.

Booker faces especially intense pressure. He’s yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling requirements for the December debate, and his campaign acknowledges that he needs to capitalize on the national spotlight.

The New Jersey senator took an apparent shot at Buttigieg at one point, following the news that his campaign had used a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently had nothing to do with the campaign.

“I want to turn back to the issue of black voters,"" Booker said. ""I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.""

In his rousing closing statement Wednesday night, Booker claimed to throw out his prepared remarks to discuss the ""debt"" that all Americans owed because of the country's racist history.

""It is time to fight, and fight together,"" Booker said, as the audience applauded.

Gabbard, for her closing remarks, urged Democrats to defeat the ""divisiveness of Donald Trump"" and ""make Dr. King's dream a reality.""

In his closing statement, Buttigieg offered an olive branch to ""progressives,"" as well as ""moderates"" and ""a lot of future former Republicans,"" emphasizing his efforts to win over moderates throughout the contentious evening.

""I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building,"" Buttigieg remarked.

After the candidates left the stage, progressive author and Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson -- who didn't qualify for Wednesday's debate -- tweeted simply, ""Miss me?

""My assessment of the evidence [thus] far? Nowhere close. The evidence is conflicting and ambiguous,"" he told Hemmer.

Starr said that European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland's testimony Wednesday falls into the same category since Sondland gave conflicting information about whether President Trump sought a quid pro quo with Ukraine involving military aid and an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

""Clearly in his opening statement, a quid pro quo. And then, he says later, 'Well, the president said, 'I don't want anything. Right? President Zelensky should just do the right thing.' [Those are] the words from the president himself,"" he continued.

SONDLAND IMPLICATES TOP OFFICIALS ON UKRAINE, BUT SAYS HE ‘NEVER HEARD’ QUID PRO QUO FROM TRUMP

""So, the record at the end of the day is likely to be ambiguous at best, conflicting at best ... and you shouldn't charge and you cannot convict a sitting president on the basis of conflicting and ambiguous evidence and destabilize the American government,"" Starr argued.

He told Hemmer that the entire impeachment inquiry is ""so terrible for the country."" Hemmer cited a Democratic lawmaker who told him he wants the hearings to end and for Congress to issue a censure to Trump over his behavior.

""During the Clinton years and during the Clinton impeachment, voices such as Dianne Feinstein -- she's still in the Senate -- said, 'This is serious...misconduct, but do we really want to remove a sitting president from office? Let's censure him,'"" Starr pointed out.

""So, at least, I hope the Democrats will have that conversation about we don't like the way foreign policy was conducted here, the delay [in providing aid] and so forth. That's debatable, but it is not the stuff of impeachment,"" he told Hemmer.

Later in the morning, after hearing testimony from David Holmes, a U.S. State Department official in Ukraine, and former National Security Council aide Fiona Hill, Starr said he does not believe a ""corrupt bargain"" by Trump is being proven.

Starr said Hill's testimony about Russian interference in the 2016 election was ""eloquent,"" particularly about the Kremlin trying to ""sow seeds of discord"" on both sides. He said it's ""willful blindness"" for the president's critics to dismiss allegations that Ukrainian officials were supporting Hillary Clinton."

Rachel Maddow, the network’s top liberal voice and lead moderator, kicked off the Atlanta debate Wednesday by noting that Elizabeth Warren is ready to convict the president: “Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?”

Then she asked Amy Klobuchar about having said she’d wait for the evidence: “After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?”

SONDLAND DECLARES QUID PRO QUO, PUNDITS CALL TESTIMONY DAMAGING TO TRUMP

Next, Maddow asked Bernie Sanders: “How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?” And she put the same question to Pete Buttigieg.

And that’s pretty much how the evening went. No wonder the New York Times called it “the debate that wasn’t.”

There were few sparks. Most of the questions were polite, a chance for the 10 contenders to deliver their stump speeches. They said they were for daycare and voting rights and against climate change.

Maybe that’s why it was the lowest-rated debate of the season, seen by 6.5 million viewers—down from 8.5 million for the CNN debate last month.

The two reporters on the panel, MSNBC’s Kristen Welker and the Post’s Ashley Parker, asked some more aggressive questions. But the candidates, with little prodding, also showed little desire to mix it up. What passed for drama was Cory Booker professing shock that Joe Biden wouldn’t support legalizing marijuana. And all the pundit predictions about how Buttigieg would get beat up now that he’s the front-runner in Iowa proved to be wrong.

Andrea Mitchell did note that Mayor Pete won an election in South Bend with 11,000 votes, asking: “Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he said. That was as rough as it got.

It was all very high road. Warren wasn’t really pressed on her latest explanation for her $20-trillion Medicare for All plan. No one really “won.”

Afterward, things seemed rather clubby. Chris Matthews told Booker during an interview that he did “great” and was inspiring.

And Maddow told Brian Williams: “I felt sitting here like, you know, these 10 candidates are getting a chance to put their best foot forward and make their best cases.” Is that a network’s goal in hosting a presidential debate?

But even if the debate had produced conflict or fireworks, it would have been largely forgotten 10 hours later, when the impeachment hearings resumed. The anchor of MSNBC’s coverage Thursday: Anti-Trump host Nicolle Wallace, who has led or co-anchored every day of the hearings. Matthews anchored one day last week.

Wallace called Fiona Hill’s appearance “some of the most searing testimony” and said it “packed a wallop.” A day earlier, she declared: “I think Gordon Sondland’s testimony changed everything.”

If MSNBC has had a token conservative guest during these hearings, I’ve missed it. And as I keep pointing out, the impeachment coverage on CNN and Fox has consistently been anchored by journalists.

But the Democratic debate was always destined to be overshadowed. Impeachment is consuming all the media oxygen. The debate was barely mentioned all day Wednesday on MSNBC itself until a half hour before it began. And it’s already becoming a footnote.

Obama White House aide David Axelrod tweeted during the Atlanta event, “It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate. Kind of low energy.”

It wasn’t just you, David."

The Utah Republican addressed his colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee as the second week of public impeachment hearings came to a close.

“Everyone knows what they're going to do next,” Stewart said of the panel's Democrats. “They're going to impeach the president. They're going to send it on to the Senate. But that is the good news. That's good news.

“The leadership of this committee has been unfair and dishonest,” Stewart continued, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. “I know we hear these crocodile tears from some of my colleagues who are heartbroken because they finally have to impeach this president. And we know that's absurd. They're not heartbroken. There's no prayerful tears over this. They're giddy over this. And there's not a person in the country who doesn't know that.”

“The leadership of this committee has been unfair and dishonest. They're giddy over this [impeachment inquiry]. And there's not a person in the country who doesn't know that.” — U.S. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah

The next step in the impeachment process involves the House Intelligence Committee sending a report to the House Judiciary Committee, which will then decide whether to file articles of impeachment against Trump. If the likely outcome occurs, the Senate is expected to hold a two-week-long trial that could begin as early as January, The Washington Post reported.

“These proceedings have been anything but fair. The Senate has an opportunity to fix that,” Stewart said, according to Deseret News of Salt Lake City. “I am confident they will. And I look forward to them completing the job that we could have done here.”

Stewart drew national attention last week when questioning former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who testified that she could supply the panel with no information regarding criminal activity or bribes that Trump may have been involved with. The White House praised Stewart on Twitter, saying it took Stewart just “30 seconds” to get the answer House Democrats spent seven hours trying to avoid.

According to Stewart, Democrats produced no evidence of bribery or extortion, and elicited from witnesses no “firsthand” knowledge of a quid pro quo agreement when Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the country, The Tribune reported. A transcript of the July 25 phone call between the two leaders showed Trump also asked for information about the hacking of the DNC server in 2016 – an issue that came up in Thursday’s hearing.

Also Thursday, Trump had lunch with two of his most vocal GOP critics in the Senate -- another Utah Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney, and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine – as the likelihood of an impeachment trial rises, Politico reported. The president has met with about 40 Republican senators this fall in an effort to communicate his account of the July 25 call that first prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to kick off an informal impeachment process in September.

Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday heard testimony from two witnesses -- former National Security Council aide Fiona Hill and U.S. State Department official David Holmes.

Holmes, who described how he overheard a phone call this summer with Trump about wanting Ukraine to conduct political investigations, testified he eventually understood that “demand” to be linked to delayed military aid. Hill clashed with Republicans after accusing some lawmakers of embracing the “fictional narrative” that only Ukraine -- and not Russia -- interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

DAN GAINOR: NY TIMES COLUMNIST ADMITS THERE'S AN ANTI-TRUMP DEEP STATE — BUT CLAIMS MEMBERS ARE THE GOOD GUYS

Far from denying the danger of an unelected careerist bureaucracy that seeks to overturn presidential policies, New York Times columnists have praised its efforts to nullify the Trump agenda.

On the first day of the impeachment inquiry, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called his initial two witnesses, career State Department diplomats William Taylor Jr. and George Kent. Far from providing damning evidence of criminal presidential behavior, Taylor and Kent mostly confined themselves to three topics: their own sterling résumés, their lack of any firsthand knowledge of incriminating Trump action, and their poorly hidden disgust with the manner and substance of Trump’s foreign policy.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Oddly, both had little clue that their demeanor and thinly disguised self-importance were a perfect example of why Trump got elected — to come up with new ideas antithetical to the conventional wisdom of unelected career bureaucrats.

Taylor and Kent announced that they are simply high-minded civil servants who serve the presidential administrations of both parties without bias.

But by nature, the huge federal bureaucracy counts on bigger government and more taxes to feed it. So naturally, the bureaucracy is usually more sympathetic to big-government progressives than to small-government conservatives.

Taylor and Kent cited their anguish with Trump’s foreign policy toward Ukraine — namely that it did not go through official channels and was too unsympathetic to Ukraine and too friendly to Russia. If so, one might have thought the anguished bureaucrats would have similarly gone public during the Obama administration.

After all, Vice President Joe Biden took over the Obama administration’s Ukrainian policy at a time when his son Hunter was knee-deep in Ukrainian affairs. As a consultant for a Ukrainian natural gas company, Hunter Biden made a reported $80,000 a month without expertise in either the energy business in particular or Ukraine in general.

Also, Trump’s policies have been more anti-Russian and pro-Ukrainian than those of the Obama administration. Trump armed the Ukrainians; Obama did not. Trump imposed new sanctions against Russia, used force against Russian mercenaries in Syria, beefed-up NATO defenses, pulled the U.S. out an asymmetrical missile treaty with Russia, and pumped more oil and gas to lower world prices — much to the chagrin of oil-exporting Russia.

In contrast, Obama was the architect of “reset” with Russia that reached its nadir in a hot mic exchange in which Obama offered a quid pro quo, vowing more flexibility on issues such as U.S.-sponsored missile defense in Eastern Europe in exchange for Russia giving Obama “space” to concentrate on his reelection.

Trump’s critics have also radically changed their spin on “coups.” To them, “coup” is no longer a dirty word trafficked in by right-wing conspiracists. Instead, it has been normalized as a possibly legitimate means of aborting the Trump presidency.

Mark Zaid, the attorney representing the Ukraine whistleblower, boasted in two recently discovered tweets of ongoing efforts to stage a coup to remove Trump.

“#coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion. #impeachment will follow,” Zaid tweeted in January 2017. Later the same month, he tweeted: “#coup has started. As one falls, two more will take their place.”

Retired Admiral William H. McRaven recently wrote an op-ed for The New York Times all but calling for Trump’s ouster — “the sooner the better.”

No sooner had Trump been elected than Rosa Brooks, a former Defense Department official during the Obama administration, wrote an essay for Foreign Policy magazine discussing theoretical ways to remove Trump before the 2020 election, among them a scenario involving a military coup.

In September 2018, The New York Times published an op-ed from an anonymous White House official who boasted of supposedly widescale efforts inside the Trump administration to nullify its operations and subvert presidential directives.

Such efforts to oppose Trump are often self-described as “The Resistance,” a reference to the underground French fighters resisting the Nazis in World War II.

Trump’s opponents often have praised the deep state precisely because unelected career officials are seen as the most effective way to sabotage and stymie his agenda.

A “coup” is no longer proof of right-wing paranoia, but increasingly a part of the general progressive discourse of resistance to Trump.

In these upside-down times, patriotism is being redefined as removing a president before a constitutionally mandated election.

""I am deeply humbled and grateful to my colleagues for entrusting me with the chairmanship,"" Maloney said in a statement. ""I'm honored by this opportunity to do more for the American people and will do my best to follow the honorable example that Chairman Cummings left for us all. There's much work to be done, and I can't wait to get started.""

Maloney is the first woman to ever hold the title and served as the acting chair of the influential committee after Cummings died; he was one of several Democrats across three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

Maloney, who has served in Congress for 14 terms and has been a vocal critic of Trump, previously promised that the impeachment probe would continue uninterrupted in the wake of Cummings' death.

“Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney has been a force for progress in America for decades,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""At the helm of the Joint Economic Committee, she has honed a keen understanding of the priorities and needs of the American people, and has worked tirelessly to deliver progress that lifts up families in every corner of America. She brings outstanding legislative experience and knowledge of the workings of the Congress that will strengthen the Oversight Committee’s work at this critical time in our nation’s history.""

“We are confident that Congresswoman Maloney’s leadership will help ensure that the Congress can function as our Founders intended, as a co-equal branch acting as a check and balance on the others, and that our Democratic Majority can continue to achieve progress For The People.”

The committee has consistently drawn the ire of Republicans, particularly with its oversight inquiries of the Trump administration’s handling of the census and immigration matters, as well as Trump’s business dealings and security clearances granted to White House officials.

As the previous chair, Cummings, 68, publicly feuded with Trump over the president's comments this past summer about living conditions in his Baltimore district.

The announcement comes as three House committees spearheading the investigation into Trump -- which is examining whether or not the president committed an impeachable offense by attempting to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid to Ukraine --continue to hold a series of public depositions on Capitol Hill."

He wants Barr to state publicly that even if the president did what congressional Democrats claim -- conditioning the release of $391 million in vital military and financial aid to Ukraine upon the announcement of a Ukrainian government investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden -- such behavior did not constitute impeachable offenses.

The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality.

It is unseemly for the chief law enforcement officer in the land to make partisan attacks against ideological groups. This gives the impression that he is a political hack, not an impartial instigator and supervisor of criminal prosecutions.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: SCHIFF GAMES TRUMP IMPEACHMENT SHOW — IN LEGITIMATE PROCEEDINGS, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS

However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.

The Constitution was written to establish and to constrain the federal government. James Madison gave us a limited federal government and a presidency that was limited to enforcing the laws Congress enacted. This limited central government is the Madisonian model -- the feds may only do that which the Constitution expressly or impliedly authorizes.

When Woodrow Wilson came to the presidency, he had new ideas about the nature of the federal government. And he succeeded in imposing those ideas on the executive branch he headed and on the Congress whose appetitive for more power he whetted.

Wilson turned a modest constitutional presidency on its head. He argued, for example, that because the First Amendment prohibits Congress from infringing upon the freedom of speech, it imposed no such restraints on the presidency. That was his justification for dispatching a federal police force he created on his own -- which would later become the FBI -- to arrest young men for singing German beer hall songs in bars and taverns during World War I and for reading aloud the Declaration of Independence near the entrances to draft registration facilities.

Wilson also argued that the concept of the president as “head of state” gave him powers not articulated in the Constitution -- powers inherent in foreign heads of state. From this he crafted the Wilsonian model -- the feds can do whatever draws political support, except that which the Constitution expressly prohibits.

All post-Wilson presidents have followed his model, and this is where Attorney General Barr misses his mark. Madison predicted that the most feared branch of the new government -- the one that could get away with the most lawlessness, the one whose power would expand at the expense of the other two -- would be the presidency.

He was right.

Franklin D. Roosevelt closed banks and seized gold. Harry Truman unleashed domestic spies on Americans and killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of innocent Japanese civilians at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Dwight Eisenhower ratcheted up domestic spying. Lyndon B. Johnson fought an illegal war by duping Congress into funding it. Richard Nixon spied on folks who exercised free speech that was critical of him and bombed Cambodia without any congressional authorization.

George H.W. Bush fought undeclared wars in Panama and Iraq and sent troops to kidnap a foreign head of state. Bill Clinton raised taxes retroactively and bombed an aspirin factory in Kosovo to divert American attention from his disastrous televised interrogation before a federal grand jury. George W. Bush authorized foreign torture and massive domestic spying. Barack Obama declared war on Libya and rewrote immigration laws that Congress rejected. President Trump has imposed a sales tax that he calls a tariff, bombed Syria without congressional consent, defied federal court orders at the border and spent money from the federal treasury not appropriated by Congress.

All of these presidential misdeeds were without constitutional authority and without sanction. Stated differently, they got away with it. Except in Nixon's case, not Congress, not the courts, and not the American public interfered. In fact, they looked the other way as the imperial presidency grew.

The common historical theme in all this is the willingness of Congress and the American public to accept claims of temporary safety over the loss of personal liberty.

The presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama are particularly instructive. A Republican Congress gave Bush the power to force computer service providers and telecoms to work as federal spies against their will. And a Democratic Congress gave Obama the power to regulate the personal delivery of health care in private settings.

Trump has inherited all this, and Barr knows all this. No post-Wilson president has been loyal to his oath to remain within the confines of the Constitution, because power by its nature expands. And power once given -- by Republican Congresses to Republican presidents and by Democratic Congresses to Democratic presidents -- remains in the presidency.

When Rome was threatened by serious invasions of pirates during the last days of the Republic, the Roman Senate gave near-dictatorial powers to the famous general Pompey, which he used to fight and defeat the invaders. When the wars were over, Pompey retained his powers. Cicero famously asked why the Republic repelled invaders so as to enjoy the rule of law only to give it away to a strong man. He complained that the Senate gave so much power to the general, it was now powerless to contain him.

And then, after Pompey passed his powers on to Caesar, the Republic ended and the imperial dictatorship began.

Stretched over the course of five days, 12 witnesses testified.

These hearings have revealed a common and consistent thread. None of the witnesses have provided any direct evidence that President Trump committed an impeachable act. Instead, they have offered an endless stream of hearsay, opinion and speculation.

The accusation that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into a “quid pro quo” in which U.S. military aid was contingent upon an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter is unsupported by the evidence presented. It is found nowhere in the transcript of the July 25 telephone conversation between Trump and Zelensky. Nor was it presented by any of the witnesses called by Schiff, D-Calif.

DEMS COULD DRAFT 4 ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT, GOP PLANS FOR FULL SENATE TRIAL, SOURCES SAY

Here is a summation of what the main witnesses said, coupled with a closing argument for why this impeachment charade should be dismissed.

DAY ONE

The first two witnesses had no firsthand knowledge of Trump’s decision to temporarily hold back nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, nor did they have any direct discussion with President Trump about his intent.

The witnesses did not listen in on the Trump-Zelensky phone conversation. To describe them as remote, irrelevant and immaterial witnesses is an understatement. This did not stop them from offering their interpretations and conjecture.

William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified it was his “understanding” there was a link between U.S. security assistance and an investigation of Joe Biden.

How did Taylor arrive at his opinion? He heard it through discussions with other diplomats, although there is no indication that any of these individuals had primary knowledge of anything.

The chain of hearsay went something like this: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told National Security Council official Tim Morrison who, in turn, told Taylor that there was a purported “quid pro quo.” This was triple hearsay. Or, as Taylor told the Intelligence Committee: “My understanding is only coming from people that I talked to.”

Taylor did admit that he had three meetings with President Zelensky after the Trump-Zelensky phone call – and said the subject of an alleged “quid pro quo” of financial aid in exchange for Ukrainian investigations never came up. This was strong evidence that no “quid pro quo” ever existed.

George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state, testified that he “believed” there was a “quid pro quo” after speaking to Taylor who spoke to Morrison who heard it from Sondland. This was quadruple hearsay. Importantly, the original source for both Kent and Taylor was Sondland. Where did Sondland get it? From no one at all. He “presumed” it. More on that to follow.

Neither Kent nor Taylor have ever met or spoken with President Trump. They simply propagated and repeated speculation built on multiple hearsay. Together, they represent a chattering class that traffics in gossip and supposition in their diplomatic echo chamber.

In a court of law, Kent and Taylor would never be allowed to testify. Yet, they were invited by Democrats to ruminate about a conversation to which they were not privy, even though Taylor readily conceded: “I don’t know what President Trump was thinking about the Ukrainians.”

Kent was more direct when he admitted: “I think, in the vacuum of a clear explanation, people started speculating.” No kidding.

DAY TWO

Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, took center stage in the second day of the hearings. She had no knowledge of the supposed “quid pro quo” because she had been fired a full two months before the Trump-Zelensky telephone call. This prompted ranking committee member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., to quip: “I’m not exactly sure what the ambassador is doing here today.” Valid point.

However, that did not stop Democrats from asking Yovanovitch to tender her opinion of the conversation and her innermost feelings at being described by Trump in an unflattering light. Right on cue, she lamented that she was “shocked and devastated.”

Democrats seized upon “the smear” of Yovanovitch as evidence of a larger scheme involving bribery that would constitute an impeachable offense. This was tortured logic, of course.

Bribery may be a more marketable way of describing a “quid pro quo,” which was Schiff’s obvious intent – a reported focus group told him so. But if there’s no evidence of a “quid pro quo,” there is no evidence of bribery. The chairman, a former prosecutor, seemed oblivious to the obvious deduction.

Schiff did manage to fabricate the most memorable, if not amusing, moment of the day when he read a critical comment of Yovanovitch tweeted by Trump during the hearing. He then invited the witness to bemoan that she felt “intimidated.”

In truth, the most egregious acts of obstruction have been committed by Rep. Schiff.

This produced an immediate and predictable charge by the chairman that the president was guilty of “witness intimidation,” which would surely constitute an article of impeachment.

Terribly sorry, but it is not “witness intimidation” for someone to publicly invoke his First Amendment right to free speech in defense of himself against what he perceives to be false accusations.

MARK LEVIN: ADAM SCHIFF IS THE 'ADMIRAL YAMAMOTO' OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS

DAY THREE

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a somewhat pompous staffer on the National Security Council, was the featured witness. After scolding Nunes for not addressing him by his Army rank, Vindman testified that he felt “concerned” about Trump’s conversation with Zelensky. As with the witnesses before him, this was his gratuitous opinion.

Vindman, not lacking in hubris, seemed convinced that he was in charge of U.S. foreign policy, not the president. Even though he confessed that he’d never so much as met Trump, the National Security Council staffer bragged in his deposition: “I’m the director for Ukraine. I’m responsible for Ukraine. I’m the most knowledgeable. I’m the authority for Ukraine, for the National Security Council and the White House.”

How dare the president not defer to an unelected subordinate employee on matters of foreign relations!

Vindman had prepared materials and talking points in advance for Trump’s use in his call with Zelensky. When Trump did not follow the staffer’s script, Vindman became offended.

Vindman grumbled about it to others, including the faux whistleblower or an intermediary who then fed it to the confidential informant. Vindman’s apparent insubordination and leak set in motion the chain of events that led to the present impeachment inquiry.

Tim Morrison, who served as Vindman’s boss, could barely contain his contempt for Vindman, calling into question his judgment.

For his part, Morrison testified he had no “concern” about Trump’s conversation with Zelensky. He said there was “nothing improper” although he feared that Democrats would politicize the call. “My fears have been realized,” he observed.

Morrison emphasized that Ukraine did not even know that financial aid had been temporarily halted until weeks after the phone call, discrediting the notion of a “quid pro quo.” He confirmed that President Trump’s reluctance to hand over almost $400 million in assistance was based on his overriding concern that the money would be squandered by corrupt government officials in Kiev.

Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, reiterated that Ukraine was unaware of the hold on aid. He told the committee he was “never involved in anything I considered to be bribery or quid pro quo.”

When asked if President Trump ever said he was not going to allow aid to go to Ukraine unless there were investigations into the Bidens or meddling in the 2016 election, Volker replied: “No, he did not.” The aid was delivered, and there was no investigation.

DAY FOUR

Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, was touted as the Democrats’ “star witness” who would implicate Trump in all manner of impeachable offenses. The opposite occurred.

Sondland acknowledged that the president kept repeating to him “over and over again” that there was no “quid pro quo.” Quoting Trump, the ambassador testified that the president said: “I want nothing, I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.”

DEM MOCKS SONDLAND OVER CHANGING TESTIMONY IN HEATED EXCHANGE

Thrusting a dagger into the heart of Democrats’ hopes of some damning indictment of Trump, Sondland made it abundantly clear that he never heard from the president that U.S. financial support was conditioned on an announcement of investigations.

Indeed, no one told Sondland. More than a dozen times he said that he merely “presumed” it. He called it a “guess.” The most penetrating exchange came during a withering cross-examination by Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio:

Turner: So you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations?

Sondland: Other than my presumption.

Turner: Which is nothing!

After that, Sondland seemed to melt and, with it, Schiff’s certitude that he had finally found a witness who would feed his insatiable desire to evict the president from the Oval Office.

DAY 5

After Sondland’s self-immolation, the fifth day of the two-week-long impeachment saga was comparatively anti-climactic.

David Holmes, an official at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, claimed he overheard portions of a telephone conversation between President Trump and Sondland on July 26 – just one day after the Trump-Zelensky call. By eavesdropping, he said he formed the “impression” that the hold on U.S. security assistance to Ukraine was “likely intended” to nudge Ukraine into investigating the Bidens.

Beyond his supposition, Holmes had no other knowledge to support his opinion. He admitted that he had no real idea why the aid was withheld or whether Ukrainian officials even knew that it was temporarily halted.

Unbelievably, Holmes relied on various news reports and accounts from other witnesses, rather than his own independent knowledge which was conspicuously scant. He was an eyewitness to almost nothing, but an ear-witness to only part of a telephone conversation.

Like Yovanovich before her, Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, left her position before the Trump-Zelensky conversation ever took place. She had no firsthand knowledge of it or why U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was temporarily delayed. Indeed, she was unaware of the call until it became public. Hill was a largely superfluous witness who added nothing to the central issue.

No Basis for Impeachment

Fox News has been informed that Democrats will be focusing on several specific articles of impeachment. One of them is bribery.

Yet, as Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, pointed out, not a single witness ever used the word “bribery” to describe President Trump’s conduct. To the contrary, most of the witnesses aggressively refuted any knowledge or evidence of bribery.

Since bribery necessarily requires a “quid pro quo,” where is the reliable or verifiable evidence of that anywhere in the testimony of the dozen witnesses who testified?

Many witnesses speculated. None offered proof. The best evidence is still the Trump-Zelensky conversation itself. The transcript shows there is no demand, threat, condition or pressure by Trump for a “quid pro quo.” This is corroborated by Zelensky himself, who is on record repudiating the purported “quid pro quo.”

A second impeachment article may be contempt of Congress, including “witness intimidation.” But that is clearly defined under law as a physical threat to a witness, bribing a witness, or coercing a witness to lie.

As noted earlier, a president – or anyone else, for that matter – is entitled to defend himself in a public statement or a tweet.

Another article of impeachment may be obstruction of justice and/or contempt of Congress for not providing documents and failing to produce witnesses to the Intelligence Committee. This is just plain silly.

Invoking executive or other communications privileges is neither obstruction nor impeachable contempt. The president is permitted to exercise legally recognized privileges.

As my colleague Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, explained: “When a person asserts a privilege recognized by law, we don’t call that obstruction. We call that the law in action.” If Schiff cares to challenge that right or privilege, he can do so in federal court.

In truth, the most egregious acts of obstruction have been committed by Rep. Schiff. He continues to hide the identity of the whistleblower without statutory authority. He refuses to apply the standards of fundamental fairness and due process to his impeachment proceedings.

By contorting the impeachment clause, Schiff has consistently demonstrated contempt for the Constitution. His Republican adversaries certainly have plenty of contempt for the way he has mishandled his impeachment charade.

It never ends.

Washington endured, and the rest of America ignored, yet another round of it on Wednesday. The hearings consumed virtually every hour of Wednesday's available daylight and elevated to international celebrity this country's current ambassador to the European Union, a man called Gordon Sondland.

In contrast to other recent witnesses, Sondland wasn't obviously hostile to the administration. In fact, he was appointed directly by President Trump. He was also a major Trump donor. So, given those two facts, Sondland's opening statement this morning initially looked like a complete disaster for the administration.

KEN STARR ON IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS SO FAR: WE'RE 'NOWHERE CLOSE' TO IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES

Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to European Union: I know that members of this committee frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question, ""Was there a quid pro quo?"" As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is, ""Yes.""

So that's how the morning began. ""The answer is, 'Yes,'"" said Gordon Sondland. ""There was a quid pro quo."" And not only that, he explained, pretty much everybody knew about it.

Sondland: Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19th, days before the presidential call.

Holy smokes! For a moment there, it looked like case closed. The final ignominious end of the Trump presidency, the one that our perpetually excitable friends in the news media have been confidently predicting day after rage-filled day, for more than three years now. The last meltdown -- the great Orange Hindenburg finally bursts into flames.

In TV studios across midtown Manhattan, cable news contributors struggled to hold back tears of joy. And then Adam Schiff took the microphone.

Schiff, as the ringmaster of this particular circus, was determined to bring it to its final theatrical close. ""Tell us,"" Adam Schiff said, ""about President Trump's deal with Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden in return for foreign aid.""

It was the moment Democrats had been waiting for. But, when it finally arrived, Gordon Sondland wouldn't read from the script.

Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: Though President Trump claimed to you there was no quid pro quo, he also made it clear to you in that call that President Zelensky had to ""clear things up and do it in public."" You don't have a reason to dispute that's what you told --

Sondland: I don't have any reason to dispute the ""clear things up and do it in public."" What I'm trying to be very clear about was President Trump never told me directly that the aid was tied to that statement.

Schiff: But in that same conversation you had with him about the aid, about the quid pro quo, he told you that President Zelensky had to ""clear things up and do it in public,"" correct?

Sondland: I did not have a conversation with him about the aid. I had a conversation with him as referenced in my text about quid pro quo.

Schiff: Well, the quid pro quo you were discussing was over the aid, correct?

Sondland: No. President Trump -- when I asked him the open-ended question, as I testified previously, ""What do you want from Ukraine,"" his answer was, ""I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing."" That's all I got from President Trump.

So, they pushed him, and they pushed him, and they pushed him again, but Gordon Sondland would not, in the end, mouth Adam Schiff's talking points. Well, why not?

Maybe because he didn't have any evidence that they were true.

As Sondland conceded in the exchange with Congressman Michael Turner, his assessment of any deals Trump may have struck with Ukraine was based mostly on assumptions.

U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio: No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations - yes or no?

Sondland: Yes.

Turner: So, you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations?

Sondland: Other than my own presumption.

Turner: Which is nothing.

This is tiresome. And of course, we apologize for it as we have in nights' past. But since it's happening, we feel duty-bound to explain it.

So a presumption. Now, some presumptions are correct. Others are laughably wrong. But one thing a presumption definitely isn't is evidence. You can't overturn an election based on a presumption. You can't stage an impeachment on presumptions. You need facts to do that. And as the day went on, Sondland introduced a new fact: the president, Gordon Sondland told us, had told him explicitly that he, in fact, didn't want a quid pro quo with Ukraine.

U.S. Rep Jim Jordan, R-Ohio: You said to the president of the United States, ""What do you want from Ukraine?"" The president: ""I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing. I want him to do what he ran on.""

Why didn't you put that statement in your opening statement? I think you said you couldn't fit it in. Is that right? Instead, we might be here for 46 minutes instead of 45 minutes?

Sondland: It wasn't -- it wasn't purposeful, trust me.

Jordan: It wasn't purposeful?

Sondland: No.

Jordan: Couldn't fit it in a 23-page opener?

It's a fair question, actually. So why wasn't that fact -- and it's not a small point, by the way. It's the point on which the entire impeachment hangs. Why wasn't that point included in Sondland's opening statement? Well, we don't know, really, but here's one possible explanation.

The statement was likely drafted by Sondland's legal team. All four of his attorneys -- it turns out, because we checked -- are Democratic donors. The man seated next to Gordon Sondland today during the hearing, that would be a man called Robert Luskin. He has given over $130,000 to the Democrats over the years. Luskin also represented the FBI informant, Stefan Halper during the Russia hoax not too long ago.

Yes, a lot of people in Washington despise Donald Trump. But still, to this moment, nobody can prove a crime.

So is it possible that someone like Luskin was thinking about more than his client's personal interests in this case? Could impeaching public enemy No. 1 have crossed his mind? We don't know, but it doesn't seem implausible.

We should also point out something that the press conveniently overlooked in its analysis Wednesday for the most part. Gordon Sondland and his family have been under intense political pressure -- in some cases, scary political pressure -- from the left for weeks.

Protesters have swarmed Gordon Sondland and his family in public. Democratic politicians have endorsed boycotts -- pushed boycotts -- of his businesses, his livelihood. In other words, the left has been working the refs. And that shouldn't surprise you because, for the left, this is total war.

And yet, in this one case, it didn't quite work. By the close of business today, we were back right where we were when the Ukraine circus started. In fact, we're back where we were on November 9, 2016.

Yes, a lot of people in Washington despise Donald Trump. But still, to this moment, nobody can prove a crime. Don't tell the press, though. They're celebrating as if someone did.

Jeffrey Toobin, CNN legal analyst: Now we know that every fantasy about how corrupt this administration was is actually true.

Brian Williams, MSNBC anchor: For our live coverage of the blowtorch testimony this morning from Gordon Sondland -- [he] turns out to be the guy that has offered the most stunning testimony.

Ari Melber, MSNBC anchor: In addition to that and the bombshells we've heard about, this was an IED from Mr. Sondland.

Nicolle Wallace, MSNBC anchor: As you said, taking a blowtorch to even the defense Donald Trump has offered -- we don't say this very often anymore, because it's rarely true, but I think today changed everything.

So, you heard it. ""Bombshells, IEDs, blowtorches."" Who writes the metaphors for these hair hats? It sounds like Wednesday's hearing was taking place in ISIS territory, in the caliphate. But the really telling line comes from the CNN legal analyst -- and we're quoting now: ""Every fantasy about how corrupt this administration was is actually true.""

So pause for a minute and think about what he's telling you. All of the fantasies the press has held without evidence are true based on testimony from another person who doesn't have evidence.

So you remember the Russia collusion story? Remember Stormy Daniels? Remember every totally baseless -- and in some cases, insane -- allegation that people like CNN's legal analyst Toobin invented and promoted and used to try to affect elections and, in so doing, destroyed lives? Well, they're telling us that all of them were true because of our presumptions. That's the most revealing thing in all of this.

From the beginning, Washington has had ""presumptions"" about what the new president was like, about what policies voters were allowed to choose. Voters weren't allowed to end foreign wars by casting a ballot, or to put America first, or to secure America's borders.

That's not on the table. Those aren't menu options. This isn't a real democracy, according to the people who administer the democracy.

And, by the way, that ought to make you nervous. You come to Washington, the city that's in charge of our democracy, and no one believes in it? You're like -- if you showed up in Detroit and everyone's driving a Japanese car, would it make you nervous? It would.

And they don't believe in it. And so, what they're really saying to voters is you can't actually make changes to American policies, the ones that we support. All you're allowed to do is rubber-stamp the current status quo, the one that enriches private equity managers and defense contractors and parasites in the vast federal bureaucracy -- our donors and friends. Other than that, shut up and obey.

So that's their program. And maybe they'll succeed in the end. Maybe they'll remove the president. OK. What then?

Well, Washington will celebrate, of course. But will they have learned anything from the exercise? Will the 2016 election have changed their minds or their priorities at all, in any way? Or will they continue to console themselves with the whole thing was just some weird aberration run by Russia and racists in the heartland. Something that they can safely ignore and return to a kind of arrangement that looks very much like 1998 -- or 1978 for that matter.

Well, you know the answer to that. If the people in charge were capable of learning anything, our country wouldn't look like it does today.

Published reports have described Perry, Sondland and former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker as one of ""three amigos"" trying to set policy outside the official track. During his testimony Wednesday, Sondland produced emails and texts showing the three kept Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others apprised of their activities.

""We've been talking about corruption [and] we'd been talking about unbundling of natural gas. We've been talking about that both with [Former Ukraine President Petro] Poroshenko before Zelinsky ever got into office,"" Perry said. ""We had these same conversations ... You must make sure that there is not corruption going on in your government if you expect Americans to come in to invest here and help your country get away from that Russian influence of their [natural] gas.""

ADAM SCHIFF CLOSES PUBLIC HEARING WITH ANIMATED SPEECH: ‘THIS PRESIDENT BELIEVES HE IS ABOVE THE LAW’

Trump has come under fire from House Democrats over his July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden's dealings in the country. House Democrats said the president withheld $400 million in military aid as a condition of Ukraine launching the investigation. Trump and the White House repeatedly have denied he did anything wrong.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., closed the fifth day of public impeachment inquiry hearings with a fiery speech, saying among other things that President Trump considers himself ""above the law” and “beyond accountability.”

FIONA HILL SAYS SHE WAS GIVEN STEELE DOSSIER JUST BEFORE IT WAS PUBLISHED

“In my view, there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law,” Schiff said, adding “We are better than that,” before dramatically banging his gavel to adjourn the hearing.

Perry predicted that Trump ""will muscle right on through this. He is an extraordinary individual to stay focused and disciplined from the standpoint of, you know, we got a mission here and we're going to get through it and we're going to make this happen.

“I don't see the American people buying into this thing,"" Perry added. When asked if the Senate would vote to remove Trump from office if he is impeached, Perry said: ""Oh, Lord, no. Not a chance.""

On the roster: Dems hustle to separate black voters from Biden - Hearings done, House plots next steps on impeachment - Trump says Pompeo may run for Senate - Get your hooves did



DEMS HUSTLE TO SEPARATE BLACK VOTERS FROM BIDEN

WaPo: “[Pete] Buttigieg and [Cory] Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances? … Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. … [Kamala] Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night. Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — ‘because they know me, they know who I am.’”



Warren makes plea to black women - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a full-throated pitch to black women in a much-hyped speech [in Atlanta] on Thursday night as she tries to tear into former Vice President Joe Biden’s durability with black voters. ‘The fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,’ Warren said at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college. … Warren cast her own campaign as learning from workers battles led by black women, from washerwomen in 1881 to the formation of the National Domestic Workers of America in the 1960s and ‘70s. … Black women, the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting bloc, led every part of the program on Thursday with the exception of Warren herself.”



Biden heckled over Obama-era deportations - Fox News: “A seemingly frustrated Joe Biden advised a protester to ‘vote for Trump’ Thursday after being confronted about the Obama administration’s record on deportations. It happened at a South Carolina town hall event for the former vice president, before about 800 people at Lander University in Greenwood. Biden seemed to lose his cool when Carlos Rojas, an immigration activist with a group called Cosecha Movement, pointed out that more illegal immigrants were deported during Obama's first two years as president than during Trump’s. … ‘You should vote for Trump. You should vote for Trump,’ Biden retorted, turning away from the man. … At that point a group of protesters -- many holding signs reading ‘Not 1 More Deportation’ – began to chant that very phrase, demanding Biden pledge to stop deporting all illegal immigrants if he’s elected president. ‘No matter what happens, if someone commits perjury, they should be deported,’ Biden pressed.”



Buttigieg campaign staffers unionize - HuffPo: “Field organizers on the presidential campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have joined a union, the campaign announced on Thursday. It said in a statement that the campaign had ‘voluntarily recognized’ that IBEW Local 2321 would serve as the sole union representing campaign staffers who have the title ‘organizer.’ Staffers were informed that the organizers were forming a union, and the campaign supported that move on Thursday afternoon. In a statement, Buttigieg campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said the campaign welcomed the workers’ decision.”



Continetti: Why candidates matter most - Free Beacon: “The coverage of recent Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana has emphasized President Trump's failure to drag Republicans past the finish line. Analysts have focused on Democratic strength in the suburban regions of these states, as well as in the suburbs of Mississippi where the Republican won by a surprisingly slim 5 points. Both of these storylines are important. But so is this one: Candidate attributes and positions matter more than a state or nation's partisan tilt. President Trump and his 17 Democratic challengers might want to pay attention. … Likability and empathy matter more than wonkiness and purity. … How ironic if Democrats so concerned with electability in the primary find themselves backing a flawed and uninspiring candidate in the general. Because, you see, fate can work that way in the Twilight Zone.”



Bloomberg files federal papers to join race - WaPo: “Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a Democratic candidate for president, a potentially disruptive move that could upend the party’s nomination fight this spring. The filing, coming just eight months after Bloomberg ruled out a bid because he believed it would be too hard to win the Democratic nomination, reflects his view that the field of Democratic contenders was not well positioned to win next year and that a candidate with his experience, political moderation and deep pockets would have a better chance of defeating President Trump in a general election. Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision.”



Obama warns Dems about ‘purity tests’ in the primary - AP: “Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting ‘purity tests’ in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. … Obama urged Democrats to ‘chill out,’ saying, ‘The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide’ better health care and education and address climate change.”



John Hendrickson: What Joe Biden can’t bring himself to say - Atlantic: “Maybe you’ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden’s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. … Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific—’ He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SHORT AND SWEET

“It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature… One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71



TIME OUT: NOT ALL BLARNEY

Smithsonian: “Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman provides a decades-spanning look at one man’s relationship to organized crime, organized labor, and the truth – however slippery that concept may be. That man, Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, was a union official and mob associate whose story intersects with labor organizer Jimmy Hoffa, the Mafia, and the Kennedys. The film, Scorsese’s first to stream exclusively on Netflix, is adapted from the 2004 Sheeran biography I Heard You Paint Houses by writer Charles Brandt, in which Sheeran claims that he killed Hoffa, amongst other figures. Hoffa’s sudden disappearance in 1975 still looms large as one of America’s longest-standing unsolved mysteries…. And while many Hoffa scholars think Sheeran’s claims are bogus, and that Scorsese … got the story wrong, the film’s portrait of how organized crime became interwoven with the labor movement and the highest levels of government in the 20th century carries many elements of truth.”

HEARINGS DONE, HOUSE PLOTS NEXT STEPS ON IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “The public phase of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal appears to have wrapped. But even most House Democrats aren’t clear what happens next. The Judiciary Committee will draft and vote on articles of impeachment and send those to the full House for debate, that much is clear. But how the Judiciary panel completes the already unorthodox impeachment process is still up in the air. Though lawmakers and aides expect the 1998 proceedings against former President Bill Clinton to be the model for the Trump case, they’re quick to emphasize they haven't been told how the endgame will play out. In fact, Judiciary Committee members have received little guidance from party leaders on how the panel will conduct the proceedings or the timeframe for completing them, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides.”



White House, Senate GOP plan for brief trial starting in January - WaPo: “A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks, according to multiple officials familiar with the talks. The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, described by officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private meeting, the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely.”



Graham readies hearings to target Biden - WaPo: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday requesting documents related to former vice president Joe Biden and his communications with Ukrainian officials, a step seen as a GOP effort to counter the House impeachment investigation of President Trump. The inquiry by Graham (R-S.C.) is focused on any calls Biden may have had with Petro Poroshenko, then the Ukrainian president, regarding the firing of the country’s top prosecutor, as well as any that referenced an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that employed Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation.”



Fear the mustache - Fox News: “Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose name has repeatedly surfaced in the impeachment hearings as a witness to key events, returned to Twitter on Friday following an unexplained hiatus since his resignation in September -- cryptically vowing to share the ‘backstory’ while saying his account had been ‘suppressed unfairly.’ ‘Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned….’ Bolton tweeted early Friday. … Later, Bolton tweeted again, adding: ‘We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come…’”



Report: FBI lawyer altered document related to Carter Page - NY Post: “A former FBI lawyer allegedly altered a document related to surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the 2016 election, a report said Thursday. The evidence of the altered document was turned over to federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating how intelligence was gathered by agencies including the CIA and FBI during the probe into the Trump campaign, CNN reported. It’s not clear what role the altered document played in the investigation into Page — or if a FISA warrant against him would have been okayed without the fudged document, according to the report.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Beware of dangers of an imperial presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses Attorney General William Barr’s role in the impeachment inquiry: “Throughout the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, President Trump has been pushing Attorney General William Barr to make a public statement on the president's behalf. …The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality. … However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.” More here.



TRUMP SAYS POMPEO MAY RUN FOR SENATE

The Kansas City Star: “President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is mulling a run for Senate in Kansas next year. In a lengthy phone interview with Fox & Friends, Trump said Pompeo would ‘easily’ win the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. ‘He loves the people of Kansas. If he thought that there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas,’ Trump said. Pompeo’s office declined to comment on the president’s remarks, which come after months of speculation that he might give up his post as top diplomat to launch a Senate run. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has repeatedly encouraged the former Wichita congressman to enter the race. Pompeo has downplayed his interest, but Trump’s comments ensure that the buzz will persist. Kansas has a filing deadline of June 1, later than many states.”

“Chris, as a reformed Catholic I hooted at this descriptor. Like a ‘near occasion of sin?’ My wife and I love your report and cocktail nightly sharing bits and pieces with each other. We read for balance and you never fail to produce.” – David and Paula Perino, Arivaca, Ariz.

You're probably already familiar; but if not, here's the one I have on constant repeat for the season: The John Rutter Christmas Album. Cheers and a happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.” – Deanna Ducher, Hillsdale, Mich.



[Ed. note: Funny you would say so Ms. Ducher! So wonderful are our readers and listeners that I can scarcely sometimes believe it. First, a little context for folks who may have missed the podcast: This is a challenging time of year musically for Christians. Thanksgiving is not quite here and Advent is still more than a week away. Meantime, every store, suggested playlist, Uber driver’s sound system and seemingly every show you watch is trying to cram full-blown Christmas cavalcade down your gullet. But this is a season of Thanksgiving and meditation on those great, good gifts which we have received. It is a time of quiet, thoughtful joy, not bells pealing and hosannas shouting. What to do? Well, what I did was talked to my friend Dana Perino about it and good folks like you overheard. But the gold star goes to Laura Whitney of Paradise, Utah. A self-described “choir nerd,” she offered us an entire playlist of just this kind of music. Most of it is sacred, but it could be enjoyed by anyone. Really beautiful stuff. It included some of my favorites of all time – “It Is Well With My Soul,” “How Can I Keep From Singing?,” Beethoven’s “Eroica,” “Abide With Me” and the magnificent “Come Thou Fount Every Blessing.” The ever-obliging Brianna was kind enough to put it all into a Spotify playlist for us all to enjoy. Because of some platform issues we weren’t able to exactly replicate Ms. Whitney’s original on Spotify, and at least in one case I made the editorial decision to pick Johnny Cash’s version of “I’m Bound For The Promised Land.” But hey, it’s Johnny Cash. We hope you find it as delightful as we do. It will be something wonderful to listen as you are giving thanks and preparing to make merry.]

Some candidates are promising that, if elected, they would expand it rapidly over the next four years.

""I pledge to you, as your president I will make sure that we connect all the households with raw broadband by 2022,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a recent meet and greet in Wisconsin.

Among the candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden is calling for $20 billion in broadband spending, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $85 billion and Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for $80 billion. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already spends $4.5 billion a year on broadband.

Buttigieg has called for a public option for broadband, Warren wants to give local municipalities more control over their own broadband networks and Biden wants to extend service to tribal areas and offer subsidies to rural Americans to get better internet.

But the intractable issue has long been an unwillingness for large tech conglomerates to do the heavy lifting themselves.

“You run into this problem with private organizations where it is difficult for them from a financial perspective to justify the costs in those areas,” said tech expert Russell Holly.

Increasing access to rural broadband could be part of the Democratic strategy to woo those who might have voted for President Trump in 2016. But for those who study voting behavior, they are skeptical. The tangible advantages of infrastructure reform are not immediate.

“It’s going to be several years before we start to see this impact, whereas what are the issues that are going to strike the pocketbook within the next twelve months, I think that’s going to strike a nerve with voters,” said Emory Business School professor David Schweidel.

But without high-speed internet, the knowledge available to rural voters is limited once in the run-up to an election. Voters may not see hardly any of the digital ads candidates spend millions of dollars on. Logistically, getting the word out about polling location changes could hinder turnout.

“Just being able to share that information in a way that affects a large group of people is easier in a larger city where there’s faster internet access,” said Holly.

The digital divide does happen to be narrowing, according to the FCC.

The percentage of the population with access to broadband has increased from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 93.5 percent in 2017.

Whether voters enter the ballot box with the issue on their mind remains to be seen.

“I haven’t heard of a life or death situation yet, but I think there are situations where...people can’t get access to a telephone or a call into a 911 center...but it’s more of a nuisance,” said Gooch."

Turner confronted Holmes about his testimony that he overheard a phone conversation between Sondland and Trump a day after the controversial July 25 phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry into alleged quid pro quo dealings between Trump and Ukraine.

Holmes said Trump was talking loud enough over the phone that he could hear the president say, ""So, he's gonna do the investigation?"" referring to Zelensky opening up an investigation into the Ukraine business dealings of 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Turner did not ask any questions to Holmes or Fiona Hill, a former top National Security Council who also appeared for testimony on the fifth day of public impeachment inquiry hearings, but instead lambasted the diplomat for his account of what he heard.

""Mr. Holmes, that information had nothing whatsoever to do with the subject matter of any of these hearings. It was anecdotal, it was extraneous.

Amid the fallout of Farrow's reporting, there had been growing calls for NBC News to conduct an outside investigation into the allegations surrounding Lauer, the former ""Today"" host. Earlier this week, presidential candidates Tom Steyer and Sens.

Wemple wrote that Lack ""dodged"" his questions about the growing calls for an outside investigation.

Former Vice President Joe Biden had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network when asked about how he would carry on the #MeToo movement as president at the MSNBC debate, but he ultimately went a different direction.

But the tables could turn, should the House approve impeachment articles and trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. There, Trump’s allies are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats.

""Frankly, I want a trial,"" Trump declared Friday on “Fox & Friends.”

TRUMP CALLS FOR SENATE TRIAL, SEEKS WHISTLEBLOWER AND SCHIFF AS IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES

There’s a reason for that.

Democrats have controlled everything during marathon proceedings in the House, frustrating GOP attempts to call witnesses pertaining to the matters Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate -- specifically, the Bidens’ business dealings in that country and Kiev’s alleged interference in the 2016 election.

But that changes on the Senate side, where Republicans have the majority and Trump allies chair key committees. Already, they’ve signaled their interest in exploring issues that House Democrats glossed over during their hearings.

On Thursday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between former Vice President Joe Biden and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

This pertains to questions surrounding the elder Biden’s role in pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the natural gas firm Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board. Biden denies any wrongdoing, but Republicans have pressed for details throughout the impeachment process, in a bid to show that even though Trump’s pressure campaign on Kiev triggered the impeachment inquiry, his concern was legitimate.

On the House side, Republicans likewise encountered challenges digging into allegations of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election. While Trump has sought to press an unsupported theory that Ukraine was tied to Democratic National Committee hacking, GOP lawmakers have sought details on other issues that are more grounded in published reports -- like whether former DNC consultant Alexandra Chalupa was improperly digging up dirt on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and others with Ukraine’s help at the time.

Democrats did not grant GOP requests to call Biden's son Hunter, Chalupa and others on the House side.

But while it’s unclear if Senate Republicans will at least attempt to call these and other witnesses, high-ranking members are showing their early interest in exploring the issues.

Aside from the Graham letter, Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have penned a letter to the head of the National Archives and Records Administration to request records of multiple White House meetings that took place in 2016 involving Obama administration officials, Ukrainian government representatives and Democratic National Committee officials.

GRAHAM DEMANDS DOCUMENTS ON UKRAINE, BIDENS, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FROM 2016

Johnson and Grassley wrote that during a meeting in 2016, officials “brought up investigations relating to Burisma Holdings.” The senators added that a Ukrainian political officer working in the Ukraine Embassy in Washington said U.S. officials in that meeting asked that ""Kiev drop the Burisma probe and allow the FBI to take it over.”

They added that White House records revealed that Chalupa had attended “numerous meetings at the White House, including one event with President Obama.”

The new requests from Senate Republicans come as the House ended its series of scheduled hearings on Thursday. The Intelligence Committee could announce additional hearings and depositions, but at this time, nothing has been scheduled.

The committee may now write and transmit its report to the House Judiciary Committee, which could begin writing articles of impeachment ahead of a floor vote.

“What the House ends up passing will drive a lot of what we end up doing over here,” a senior Republican aide familiar with the ongoing discussions told Fox News Friday.

The aide told Fox News that the White House made a “positive” and “significant” development this week, as officials indicated “what they want” for the trial.

In the Senate trial, three separate parties have input to how it will play out: Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats and the White House.

“It is impossible for us to come up with contours for impeachment without input from the White House,” the aide said. “Their input is a very positive step so we can try to control this as much as possible.”

The White House, on Thursday, signaled that they would like a Senate trial to last no longer than two weeks. The impeachment of former President Bill Clinton lasted for six weeks.

“We all want speedy,” the aide said. “This is the first indication the White House has given and that’s a positive — before it was radio silence from them, and now they’re starting to indicate what they want this thing to look like.”

The aide explained that the Senate, once they receive articles of impeachment, will begin working on two resolutions — one that governs the timeline of the trial, and the other that sets up witnesses for closed-door depositions, as well as which witness will be required to testify on the stand.

The aide explained that the resolutions are “significant,” noting that they will “be the main avenue that evidence is admitted.”

The aide suggested that Republican senators like Graham, Grassley and Johnson could be attempting to help “shape” the witness list and the trial.

A senior administration official, though, claimed Friday there’s “ample reasons” for the Senate to simply dismiss the case – though GOP senators have indicated that’s unlikely to happen.

Yet the official still maintained it’s “100 percent to our advantage to have [a] full trial” in the Senate.

Meanwhile, Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said sending articles of impeachment to the Senate was ""good news.""

“Everyone knows what they’re going to do next. They’re going to impeach the president and send it onto the Senate, but that is the good news. That’s good news,” Stewart said. “In the U.S. Senate, there won’t be any secret testimony or dishonest leadership … or to deny a defense.”

He added: “So we’ll finally be able to get to the truth.”

Stewart went on to list several witnesses he hoped the Senate would call to testify, including the whistleblower, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Hunter Biden, Burisma board member Devon Archer, Chalupa, and Fusion GPS researcher Nellie Ohr.

And the president, himself, seems to be welcoming the trial as well.

“There’s nothing there,” Trump said Friday during an interview with “Fox & Friends,” saying “there should never be an impeachment,” and echoing GOP requests for the whistleblower, Schiff and Hunter Biden to appear as witnesses.

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Kiev. That call prompted the whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. Trump challenged the accuracy of the complaint, though the transcript released by the White House did support the core allegations that he pressed for politically related investigations.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement. Trump denies any wrongdoing."

“In my view there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law,” Schiff, D-Calif., said, referring to the claim that Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and withheld military aid as an incentive.

“We are better than that,” Schiff concluded as he struck a gavel in dramatic fashion.

FIONA HILL SAYS SHE WAS GIVEN STEELE DOSSIER JUST BEFORE IT WAS PUBLISHED

Schiff also slammed Republican arguments, saying it was ""clear to everyone"" that aid was withheld from Ukraine on the condition of opening investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Furthermore, he said Republicans' chracterization of testimony in the impeachment hearings as ""hearsay"" is ""absurd.""

""That would be like saying you can't rely on the testimony of the burglars during Watergate because it's only hearsay,” he said. “Or you can’t consider the fact that they tried to break in because they got caught. They actually didn’t get what they came for so no harm no foul. That’s absurd.”

Schiff’s remarks came as Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee made their closing arguments to wrap up the final impeachment hearing of the week. It may, in fact, have been the final hearing in the Houe impeachment inquiry before the matter is turned over to the chamber's Judiciary Committee.

IMPEACHMENT WITNESS FIONA HILL ONCE OPPOSED SENDING LETHAL AID TO UKRAINE IN FIGHT WITH RUSSIA

In his 20-minute speech, Schiff laid out what the committee has learned over the course of seven hearings on President Trump’s conduct with Ukraine, including details about the smear campaign against a “dedicated public servant,” former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, and Trump's desire to have Ukraine investigate Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings and the Bidens.(Hunter had a seat on the company's board.)

“He [Trump] has to smear and destroy those who get in his way and someone fighting corruption in Ukraine was getting in his way so she’s [Yovanovitch is] gone,” Schiff said Thursday.

He said Democrats will have to examine “what is our duty” as they decide on next steps.

California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the panel, called the hearings “a show trial” and said they had a pre-determined verdict.

Trump, who calls Schiff “the most dishonest man in politics,” has repeatedly blasted the lawmaker.

On Wednesday, Trump called Schiff as a ""corrupt politician,"" telling reporters the congressman ""stands up and he tells lies all day long. .. We have no due process.""

On Thursday, the president directly attacked the congressman on Twitter. ""No pressure on Ukraine,"" he said, referring to allegations of a quid pro quo. ""Great corruption & dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!""

Schiff has accused Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo in pushing for Ukraine to investigate Burisma, the Bidens, and allegations that Ukraine, and not Russia, had attempted to meddle in American elections in 2016.

Schiff said Trump's actions were a ""conditioning of official acts for something of great value to the president. These political investigations -- it goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery as well as other potential high crimes or misdemeanors.""

A statement from Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director, released Thursday said, “Adam Schiff has turned the House Intelligence Committee into an arm of the Democratic National Committee, and despite that has managed to produce no evidence at all that President Trump did anything wrong.”

Rachel Maddow, the network’s top liberal voice and lead moderator, kicked off the Atlanta debate Wednesday by noting that Elizabeth Warren is ready to convict the president: “Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?”

Then she asked Amy Klobuchar about having said she’d wait for the evidence: “After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?”

SONDLAND DECLARES QUID PRO QUO, PUNDITS CALL TESTIMONY DAMAGING TO TRUMP

Next, Maddow asked Bernie Sanders: “How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?” And she put the same question to Pete Buttigieg.

And that’s pretty much how the evening went. No wonder the New York Times called it “the debate that wasn’t.”

There were few sparks. Most of the questions were polite, a chance for the 10 contenders to deliver their stump speeches. They said they were for daycare and voting rights and against climate change.

Maybe that’s why it was the lowest-rated debate of the season, seen by 6.5 million viewers—down from 8.5 million for the CNN debate last month.

The two reporters on the panel, MSNBC’s Kristen Welker and the Post’s Ashley Parker, asked some more aggressive questions. But the candidates, with little prodding, also showed little desire to mix it up. What passed for drama was Cory Booker professing shock that Joe Biden wouldn’t support legalizing marijuana. And all the pundit predictions about how Buttigieg would get beat up now that he’s the front-runner in Iowa proved to be wrong.

Andrea Mitchell did note that Mayor Pete won an election in South Bend with 11,000 votes, asking: “Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he said. That was as rough as it got.

It was all very high road. Warren wasn’t really pressed on her latest explanation for her $20-trillion Medicare for All plan. No one really “won.”

Afterward, things seemed rather clubby. Chris Matthews told Booker during an interview that he did “great” and was inspiring.

And Maddow told Brian Williams: “I felt sitting here like, you know, these 10 candidates are getting a chance to put their best foot forward and make their best cases.” Is that a network’s goal in hosting a presidential debate?

But even if the debate had produced conflict or fireworks, it would have been largely forgotten 10 hours later, when the impeachment hearings resumed. The anchor of MSNBC’s coverage Thursday: Anti-Trump host Nicolle Wallace, who has led or co-anchored every day of the hearings. Matthews anchored one day last week.

Wallace called Fiona Hill’s appearance “some of the most searing testimony” and said it “packed a wallop.” A day earlier, she declared: “I think Gordon Sondland’s testimony changed everything.”

If MSNBC has had a token conservative guest during these hearings, I’ve missed it. And as I keep pointing out, the impeachment coverage on CNN and Fox has consistently been anchored by journalists.

But the Democratic debate was always destined to be overshadowed. Impeachment is consuming all the media oxygen. The debate was barely mentioned all day Wednesday on MSNBC itself until a half hour before it began. And it’s already becoming a footnote.

Obama White House aide David Axelrod tweeted during the Atlanta event, “It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate. Kind of low energy.”

It wasn’t just you, David."

Chris Stewart said Thursday it would be “good news” if the Democrat-led House votes for President Trump's impeachment because a trial in the Republican-led Senate would set the truth free.

The Utah Republican addressed his colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee as the second week of public impeachment hearings came to a close.

“Everyone knows what they're going to do next,” Stewart said of the panel's Democrats. “They're going to impeach the president. They're going to send it on to the Senate. But that is the good news. That's good news.

DEMS COULD DRAFT 4 ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT, GOP PLANS FOR FULL SENATE TRIAL, SOURCES SAY

“The leadership of this committee has been unfair and dishonest,” Stewart continued, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. “I know we hear these crocodile tears from some of my colleagues who are heartbroken because they finally have to impeach this president. And we know that's absurd. They're not heartbroken. There's no prayerful tears over this. They're giddy over this. And there's not a person in the country who doesn't know that.”

“The leadership of this committee has been unfair and dishonest. They're giddy over this [impeachment inquiry]. And there's not a person in the country who doesn't know that.” — U.S. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah

The next step in the impeachment process involves the House Intelligence Committee sending a report to the House Judiciary Committee, which will then decide whether to file articles of impeachment against Trump. If the likely outcome occurs, the Senate is expected to hold a two-week-long trial that could begin as early as January, The Washington Post reported.

“These proceedings have been anything but fair. The Senate has an opportunity to fix that,” Stewart said, according to Deseret News of Salt Lake City. “I am confident they will. And I look forward to them completing the job that we could have done here.”

Stewart drew national attention last week when questioning former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who testified that she could supply the panel with no information regarding criminal activity or bribes that Trump may have been involved with. The White House praised Stewart on Twitter, saying it took Stewart just “30 seconds” to get the answer House Democrats spent seven hours trying to avoid.

According to Stewart, Democrats produced no evidence of bribery or extortion, and elicited from witnesses no “firsthand” knowledge of a quid pro quo agreement when Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the country, The Tribune reported. A transcript of the July 25 phone call between the two leaders showed Trump also asked for information about the hacking of the DNC server in 2016 – an issue that came up in Thursday’s hearing.

Also Thursday, Trump had lunch with two of his most vocal GOP critics in the Senate -- another Utah Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney, and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine – as the likelihood of an impeachment trial rises, Politico reported. The president has met with about 40 Republican senators this fall in an effort to communicate his account of the July 25 call that first prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to kick off an informal impeachment process in September.

Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday heard testimony from two witnesses -- former National Security Council aide Fiona Hill and U.S. State Department official David Holmes.

Holmes, who described how he overheard a phone call this summer with Trump about wanting Ukraine to conduct political investigations, testified he eventually understood that “demand” to be linked to delayed military aid. Hill clashed with Republicans after accusing some lawmakers of embracing the “fictional narrative” that only Ukraine -- and not Russia -- interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

During an interview, the first part which aired on Saturday, Perry said that ""this president understood that American LNG could really impact the emissions issue in Europe.""

According to Perry, President Trump specifically directed him during the transition to make American energy successful like it was for his home state of Texas.

""Here's what he said when I was sitting in his office getting interviewed back in December of 2016 -- he said: 'Perry, here's what I want you to do, I want you to go do for American energy what you did for Texas.'

Perry also claimed that Americans saved more than $200 billion because of regulations and taxes that encouraged the fossil fuel industry to develop that energy source.

During Perry's interview, he also derided 2020 Democrats for promising too many ""free"" things to the electorate.

""I hear too many people talking about, 'if you vote for me, here's what I'll give you. Free, free, free, free ... there are no free lunches. Stuff costs.

RICK PERRY, OTHER OFFICIALS CALLED TO TESTIFY IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

Perry's interview came as House Democrats held impeachment hearings surrounding President Trump's relationship with Ukraine -- specifically, allegations that he pressured Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and a natural gas firm, Burisma, that his son helped lead.

“Not once, not once was the name Burisma [or] the Bidens mentioned to me,"" Perry, the former governor of Texas, said. ""Not by the president, not by Rudy Giuliani and not by [U.S. Ambassador to the European Union] Gordon Sondland. And if there's anyone who says anything different, then they're surmising.

Published reports have described Perry, Sondland and former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker as one of ""three amigos"" trying to set policy outside the official track.

Stretched over the course of five days, 12 witnesses testified.

These hearings have revealed a common and consistent thread. None of the witnesses have provided any direct evidence that President Trump committed an impeachable act. Instead, they have offered an endless stream of hearsay, opinion and speculation.

The accusation that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into a “quid pro quo” in which U.S. military aid was contingent upon an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter is unsupported by the evidence presented. It is found nowhere in the transcript of the July 25 telephone conversation between Trump and Zelensky. Nor was it presented by any of the witnesses called by Schiff, D-Calif.

DEMS COULD DRAFT 4 ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT, GOP PLANS FOR FULL SENATE TRIAL, SOURCES SAY

Here is a summation of what the main witnesses said, coupled with a closing argument for why this impeachment charade should be dismissed.

DAY ONE

The first two witnesses had no firsthand knowledge of Trump’s decision to temporarily hold back nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, nor did they have any direct discussion with President Trump about his intent.

The witnesses did not listen in on the Trump-Zelensky phone conversation. To describe them as remote, irrelevant and immaterial witnesses is an understatement. This did not stop them from offering their interpretations and conjecture.

William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified it was his “understanding” there was a link between U.S. security assistance and an investigation of Joe Biden.

How did Taylor arrive at his opinion? He heard it through discussions with other diplomats, although there is no indication that any of these individuals had primary knowledge of anything.

The chain of hearsay went something like this: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told National Security Council official Tim Morrison who, in turn, told Taylor that there was a purported “quid pro quo.” This was triple hearsay. Or, as Taylor told the Intelligence Committee: “My understanding is only coming from people that I talked to.”

Taylor did admit that he had three meetings with President Zelensky after the Trump-Zelensky phone call – and said the subject of an alleged “quid pro quo” of financial aid in exchange for Ukrainian investigations never came up. This was strong evidence that no “quid pro quo” ever existed.

George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state, testified that he “believed” there was a “quid pro quo” after speaking to Taylor who spoke to Morrison who heard it from Sondland. This was quadruple hearsay. Importantly, the original source for both Kent and Taylor was Sondland. Where did Sondland get it? From no one at all. He “presumed” it. More on that to follow.

Neither Kent nor Taylor have ever met or spoken with President Trump. They simply propagated and repeated speculation built on multiple hearsay. Together, they represent a chattering class that traffics in gossip and supposition in their diplomatic echo chamber.

In a court of law, Kent and Taylor would never be allowed to testify. Yet, they were invited by Democrats to ruminate about a conversation to which they were not privy, even though Taylor readily conceded: “I don’t know what President Trump was thinking about the Ukrainians.”

Kent was more direct when he admitted: “I think, in the vacuum of a clear explanation, people started speculating.” No kidding.

DAY TWO

Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, took center stage in the second day of the hearings. She had no knowledge of the supposed “quid pro quo” because she had been fired a full two months before the Trump-Zelensky telephone call. This prompted ranking committee member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., to quip: “I’m not exactly sure what the ambassador is doing here today.” Valid point.

However, that did not stop Democrats from asking Yovanovitch to tender her opinion of the conversation and her innermost feelings at being described by Trump in an unflattering light. Right on cue, she lamented that she was “shocked and devastated.”

Democrats seized upon “the smear” of Yovanovitch as evidence of a larger scheme involving bribery that would constitute an impeachable offense. This was tortured logic, of course.

Bribery may be a more marketable way of describing a “quid pro quo,” which was Schiff’s obvious intent – a reported focus group told him so. But if there’s no evidence of a “quid pro quo,” there is no evidence of bribery. The chairman, a former prosecutor, seemed oblivious to the obvious deduction.

Schiff did manage to fabricate the most memorable, if not amusing, moment of the day when he read a critical comment of Yovanovitch tweeted by Trump during the hearing. He then invited the witness to bemoan that she felt “intimidated.”

In truth, the most egregious acts of obstruction have been committed by Rep. Schiff.

This produced an immediate and predictable charge by the chairman that the president was guilty of “witness intimidation,” which would surely constitute an article of impeachment.

Terribly sorry, but it is not “witness intimidation” for someone to publicly invoke his First Amendment right to free speech in defense of himself against what he perceives to be false accusations.

MARK LEVIN: ADAM SCHIFF IS THE 'ADMIRAL YAMAMOTO' OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS

DAY THREE

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a somewhat pompous staffer on the National Security Council, was the featured witness. After scolding Nunes for not addressing him by his Army rank, Vindman testified that he felt “concerned” about Trump’s conversation with Zelensky. As with the witnesses before him, this was his gratuitous opinion.

Vindman, not lacking in hubris, seemed convinced that he was in charge of U.S. foreign policy, not the president. Even though he confessed that he’d never so much as met Trump, the National Security Council staffer bragged in his deposition: “I’m the director for Ukraine. I’m responsible for Ukraine. I’m the most knowledgeable. I’m the authority for Ukraine, for the National Security Council and the White House.”

How dare the president not defer to an unelected subordinate employee on matters of foreign relations!

Vindman had prepared materials and talking points in advance for Trump’s use in his call with Zelensky. When Trump did not follow the staffer’s script, Vindman became offended.

Vindman grumbled about it to others, including the faux whistleblower or an intermediary who then fed it to the confidential informant. Vindman’s apparent insubordination and leak set in motion the chain of events that led to the present impeachment inquiry.

Tim Morrison, who served as Vindman’s boss, could barely contain his contempt for Vindman, calling into question his judgment.

For his part, Morrison testified he had no “concern” about Trump’s conversation with Zelensky. He said there was “nothing improper” although he feared that Democrats would politicize the call. “My fears have been realized,” he observed.

Morrison emphasized that Ukraine did not even know that financial aid had been temporarily halted until weeks after the phone call, discrediting the notion of a “quid pro quo.” He confirmed that President Trump’s reluctance to hand over almost $400 million in assistance was based on his overriding concern that the money would be squandered by corrupt government officials in Kiev.

Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, reiterated that Ukraine was unaware of the hold on aid. He told the committee he was “never involved in anything I considered to be bribery or quid pro quo.”

When asked if President Trump ever said he was not going to allow aid to go to Ukraine unless there were investigations into the Bidens or meddling in the 2016 election, Volker replied: “No, he did not.” The aid was delivered, and there was no investigation.

DAY FOUR

Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, was touted as the Democrats’ “star witness” who would implicate Trump in all manner of impeachable offenses. The opposite occurred.

Sondland acknowledged that the president kept repeating to him “over and over again” that there was no “quid pro quo.” Quoting Trump, the ambassador testified that the president said: “I want nothing, I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.”

DEM MOCKS SONDLAND OVER CHANGING TESTIMONY IN HEATED EXCHANGE

Thrusting a dagger into the heart of Democrats’ hopes of some damning indictment of Trump, Sondland made it abundantly clear that he never heard from the president that U.S. financial support was conditioned on an announcement of investigations.

Indeed, no one told Sondland. More than a dozen times he said that he merely “presumed” it. He called it a “guess.” The most penetrating exchange came during a withering cross-examination by Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio:

Turner: So you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations?

Sondland: Other than my presumption.

Turner: Which is nothing!

After that, Sondland seemed to melt and, with it, Schiff’s certitude that he had finally found a witness who would feed his insatiable desire to evict the president from the Oval Office.

DAY 5

After Sondland’s self-immolation, the fifth day of the two-week-long impeachment saga was comparatively anti-climactic.

David Holmes, an official at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, claimed he overheard portions of a telephone conversation between President Trump and Sondland on July 26 – just one day after the Trump-Zelensky call. By eavesdropping, he said he formed the “impression” that the hold on U.S. security assistance to Ukraine was “likely intended” to nudge Ukraine into investigating the Bidens.

Beyond his supposition, Holmes had no other knowledge to support his opinion. He admitted that he had no real idea why the aid was withheld or whether Ukrainian officials even knew that it was temporarily halted.

Unbelievably, Holmes relied on various news reports and accounts from other witnesses, rather than his own independent knowledge which was conspicuously scant. He was an eyewitness to almost nothing, but an ear-witness to only part of a telephone conversation.

Like Yovanovich before her, Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, left her position before the Trump-Zelensky conversation ever took place. She had no firsthand knowledge of it or why U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was temporarily delayed. Indeed, she was unaware of the call until it became public. Hill was a largely superfluous witness who added nothing to the central issue.

No Basis for Impeachment

Fox News has been informed that Democrats will be focusing on several specific articles of impeachment. One of them is bribery.

Yet, as Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, pointed out, not a single witness ever used the word “bribery” to describe President Trump’s conduct. To the contrary, most of the witnesses aggressively refuted any knowledge or evidence of bribery.

Since bribery necessarily requires a “quid pro quo,” where is the reliable or verifiable evidence of that anywhere in the testimony of the dozen witnesses who testified?

Many witnesses speculated. None offered proof. The best evidence is still the Trump-Zelensky conversation itself. The transcript shows there is no demand, threat, condition or pressure by Trump for a “quid pro quo.” This is corroborated by Zelensky himself, who is on record repudiating the purported “quid pro quo.”

A second impeachment article may be contempt of Congress, including “witness intimidation.” But that is clearly defined under law as a physical threat to a witness, bribing a witness, or coercing a witness to lie.

As noted earlier, a president – or anyone else, for that matter – is entitled to defend himself in a public statement or a tweet.

Another article of impeachment may be obstruction of justice and/or contempt of Congress for not providing documents and failing to produce witnesses to the Intelligence Committee. This is just plain silly.

Invoking executive or other communications privileges is neither obstruction nor impeachable contempt. The president is permitted to exercise legally recognized privileges.

As my colleague Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, explained: “When a person asserts a privilege recognized by law, we don’t call that obstruction. We call that the law in action.” If Schiff cares to challenge that right or privilege, he can do so in federal court.

In truth, the most egregious acts of obstruction have been committed by Rep. Schiff. He continues to hide the identity of the whistleblower without statutory authority. He refuses to apply the standards of fundamental fairness and due process to his impeachment proceedings.

By contorting the impeachment clause, Schiff has consistently demonstrated contempt for the Constitution. His Republican adversaries certainly have plenty of contempt for the way he has mishandled his impeachment charade.

John Kennedy, R-La., on Sunday slammed the House’s impeachment inquiry into President Trump for chasing after a ""red herring"" when trying to determine whether the president tied foreign aid to Ukraine to an investigation into his political rivals, and he attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for making impeachment proceedings a “political weapon.”

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Kennedy dodged a question by Chris Wallace on whether Trump was asking Ukraine to investigate corruption or to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and instead called out Pelosi for politicizing the impeachment process.

“Speaker Pelosi is acting in a manner that is insincere, even by the standards of Congress,” Kennedy said. “She is turning impeachment into a routine political weapon.”

READ: GORDON SONDLAND'S IMPEACHMENT HEARING OPENING STATEMENT

Kennedy went on to criticize House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s move to bar Republicans from calling witnesses in the impeachment inquiry and “not allowing the president to defend himself.”

A number of Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have commented that the president is welcome to testify before the committee during the impeachment hearings.

On the issue of if there was quid pro quo between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when the president asked his Eastern European counterpart to look into the Ukraine business dealings of Biden and his son Hunter, Kennedy made his feelings clear.

“The quid pro quo is a red herring,” he said. “President Trump asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival. The matter, if proven, would be in the national interest.”

The impeachment inquiry into Trump began when a whistleblower reported that Trump had pushed Zelensky to launch a public investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine — specifically, why the former vice president pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings.

Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his son.

Kennedy’s comments come two days after his fellow Republican senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, sent a letter Thursday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between Biden, his son and Poroshenko.

Graham’s letter, which was released as the final day of public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump wrapped up, asked Pompeo to release a series of documents and transcripts of conversations in 2016 between Biden and Poroshenko in relation to an investigation into Burisma Holdings."

President Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, “I would like you to do us a favor” during their July 25 phone call. This involved probing corruption, including at Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company with unusual ties to Hunter Biden and his father, former Vice President Joe Biden. At least 11 times, Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have said that they felt neither pressured nor blackmailed into launching such an investigation, which they ultimately never did.

And the 55-day pause in lethal military aid, while Team Trump evaluated Zelensky’s commitment to his anti-corruption promises, ended on Sept. 11, when assistance reached Kiev. As U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified Wednesday, Trump told him what he wanted from Ukraine: “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.”

Compare those innocuous facts with this chilling outline of Watergate, which began with actual crimes.

On June 17, 1972, members of the White House “Plumbers Unit,” which plugged news leaks, broke into the headquarters of the Democrat National Committee in Washington, D.C.’s Watergate office complex. Bernard Barker, Virgilio Gonzalez, Eugenio Martinez, James McCord and Frank Sturgis were caught red-handed stealing documents and installing illegal wiretaps. Their supervisors soon also were arrested, namely White House aide E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy, a general counsel at CREEP — the Committee to Re-elect the President.

The Washington Post called the break-in part of “a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage conducted on behalf of the Nixon re-election effort.” This confirmed that Watergate was no one-off stunt. It was a cavalcade of electoral lawbreaking.

Compare the innocuous facts regarding Trump's call with the Ukraine president with this chilling outline of Watergate, which began with actual crimes.

Most of this nefarious enterprise was the cover-up that quickly ensued, with President Richard Milhous Nixon at the helm.

To encourage the burglars to shut up about the break-in — and their September 1971 dirt-digging breach of the Los Angeles office of Dr. Lewis Fielding, psychiatrist to Pentagon Papers' chief leaker Daniel Ellsberg — Team Nixon paid them “hush money.” This constituted conspiracy and obstruction of justice.

When the burglars demanded more money to clam up, White House Counsel John Dean entered the Oval Office on March 21, 1973. He hoped that Nixon would stop digging himself into a rapidly collapsing hole and perhaps beg the American people to forgive an overzealous prank that got way out of hand.

“We have a cancer within — close to the presidency, that’s growing,” Dean told Nixon. “It grows geometrically now, because it compounds itself.” Dean then explained that the burglars wanted more cash, to keep their lips zipped.

“How much money do you need?” Nixon asked Dean, as captured on the recording system that would undo the president.

Dean answered: “I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years” — about $5.9 million today.

Rather than back down, Nixon doubled down.

“We could get that,” Nixon said. “You could get a million dollars. You could get it in cash. I know where it could be gotten.” Dean also proposed laundering this money, “And that means you have to go to Vegas with it or a bookmaker in New York City.”

Forthwith, the burglars got their greenbacks. In fact, as Woodward and Bernstein later reported, “Within 12 hours of the Oval office discussion, Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt Jr. received $75,000 cash.” A July 5, 1974 FBI Watergate summary offers this eerie detail: “Hunt’s wife died on Dec. 8, 1972, in an aircraft crash in Chicago. Bureau agents recovered $10,000 in one hundred dollar bills in Mrs. Hunt’s purse at the time of the crash.”

Nixon’s conspiracy to obstruct justice had reached epic proportions long before this million-dollar conversation. Nixon insisted publicly that he knew nothing about the cover-up or hush money until Dean alerted him on March 21, 1973. In truth, the final, fatal “Smoking Gun Tape” revealed that the supposedly clueless Nixon ordered the cover-up nearly nine months earlier. On June 23, 1972, just six days after the break-in, Nixon commanded that the CIA torpedo the FBI’s fledgling probe.

White House chief of staff Harry Robbins “H.R. Bob” Haldeman suggested to Nixon, “the way to handle this now is for us to have [CIA official Vernon] Walters call [acting FBI chief] Pat Gray and just say, ‘Stay the hell out of this.'""

Nixon concurred and instructed that the CIA “should call the FBI in and say that ‘We wish for the country, don’t go any further into this case, period!’”

The U.S. Supreme Court ordered this recorded conversation and others publicized. Nixon released the Smoking Gun Tape on August 5, 1974. His remaining support among House Republicans imploded. Nixon resigned four days later.

How did the House of Representatives' behavior then compare with today?

On Feb. 6, 1974, the House voted 410-4 to launch Nixon’s impeachment. Fully 98 percent of Republicans decided to commence a GOP president’s impeachment.

Conversely, when the House voted 232-196 on Oct. 31 to advance an impeachment inquiry against Trump, exactly 0 percent of Republicans chose to begin impeachment against a GOP president.

If Nancy Pelosi truly believes that Ukraine-o-rama is “so much worse” than Watergate, she needs much more than an 11-day, book-filled vacation.

The House Intelligence Committee has held five days of public hearings over the past two weeks in the impeachment inquiry, which centers on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Meanwhile, a senior administration official told Fox News Friday that the White House wants its lawyers to be able to cross-examine and call witnesses if the House Judiciary Committee takes up articles of impeachment.

During an interview, the first part which aired on Saturday, Perry said that ""this president understood that American LNG could really impact the emissions issue in Europe.""

According to Perry, President Trump specifically directed him during the transition to make American energy successful like it was for his home state of Texas.

""Here's what he said when I was sitting in his office getting interviewed back in December of 2016 -- he said: 'Perry, here's what I want you to do, I want you to go do for American energy what you did for Texas.' And I said, 'I got it, Mr. President,'"" Perry recalled. The former Texas governor plans to leave the administration by the end of the year.

""And that's what we've done. We're selling American LNG now into 36 different countries on five continents,"" he added before claiming that American LNG helped save Europeans billions of dollars.

""Not only are they not held hostage by Russian gas, they're also saving money,"" he said.

Perry also claimed that Americans saved more than $200 billion because of regulations and taxes that encouraged the fossil fuel industry to develop that energy source.

During Perry's interview, he also derided 2020 Democrats for promising too many ""free"" things to the electorate.

""I hear too many people talking about, 'if you vote for me, here's what I'll give you. Free, free, free, free ... there are no free lunches. Stuff costs. We need to get this country focused on how blessed we are today to have the resources that we have, to have the freedoms that we have, and don't let them get away from us,"" he said.

RICK PERRY, OTHER OFFICIALS CALLED TO TESTIFY IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

Perry's interview came as House Democrats held impeachment hearings surrounding President Trump's relationship with Ukraine -- specifically, allegations that he pressured Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and a natural gas firm, Burisma, that his son helped lead.

“Not once, not once was the name Burisma [or] the Bidens mentioned to me,"" Perry, the former governor of Texas, said. ""Not by the president, not by Rudy Giuliani and not by [U.S. Ambassador to the European Union] Gordon Sondland. And if there's anyone who says anything different, then they're surmising. And that's not a wise thing to do.""

Published reports have described Perry, Sondland and former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker as one of ""three amigos"" trying to set policy outside the official track. During his testimony Wednesday, Sondland produced emails and texts showing the three kept Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others apprised of their activities.

As a result, many of the Democrats competing for their party’s presidential nomination are scrambling to soften their support for this radical restructuring of our health care system or highlighting their opposition to it.

But here’s the truth you won’t hear from the Democratic would-be presidents: Those who say they oppose a government takeover of our health insurance system are simply trying to soothe nervous moderates.

JUSTIN HASKINS: ELIZABETH WARREN IS A SOCIALIST – IF SHE'S THE DEM NOMINEE, THIS HAPPENS IN 2020

In fact, every single Democratic presidential candidate supports a brand of health care reform that will lead to ""Medicare-for-all."" Each just has a different timeline, with a different path on how to get to the same result.

Think of the candidates like a large number of hikers making their way through a dense forest on different trails to reach a waterfall. Some will travel quickly, others more slowly as they encounter different obstacles, but eventually all will get to the same waterfall.

""Medicare-for-all"" is a radical plan to eliminate the private insurance industry and enroll every one of us in a taxpayer-funded government-run health plan – whether we like it or not. Like our income tax system, participation will be mandatory.

At this point 53 percent of Americans support “Medicare-for-all,” according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That's down from a high of 59 percent in March 2018.

In contrast, 65 percent of Americans favor the creation of a new, government-sponsored health plan that would compete against private insurers. This so-called ""public option"" would allow everyone to access affordable health insurance coverage without eliminating private insurance, its supporters say.

The Democratic presidential candidates have been following public opinion. Just look at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. At the first candidate debate, she proudly proclaimed she was ""with Bernie on Medicare-for-all."" On Nov. 1, she unveiled her wildly unrealistic plan to pay for it.

But at last week's debate in Atlanta, Warren didn't join Sanders in his full-throated defense of ""Medicare-for-all."" Instead, she explained how she would gradually transition to a single-payer system during her first term.

Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017. If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Under Warren's plan, 135 million people would be automatically enrolled in a new Medicare-like plan right off the bat, at no cost to them.

This would include ""everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000,"" she said. Every other American would have the option to buy into the plan at a ""modest"" cost.

Warren promises to get ""Medicare-for-all"" legislation passed ""no later than"" her third year in office. Of course, there’s no way to know if the House and Senate would approve her grand plan, no matter how hard she tries to win its passage.

What Warren is proposing is a public option for the first three years of her term – and ""Medicare-for-all"" thereafter. That timeline may be unrealistic – but it may not matter. The public option would invariably result in a government takeover of health insurance.

Proponents of the public option envision reimbursing doctors and hospitals at artificially low rates dictated by the government – typically Medicare's rates, which are about 40 percent below what private insurance pays.

Today hospitals receive just 87 cents for every dollar in costs they incur caring for beneficiaries. Those pennies on the dollar add up. Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017.

If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Government doesn't need to worry about covering its costs. So it can set premiums for the public option below its claims costs. It can make up the difference by dipping into the federal Treasury – or raising taxes on hard-working Americans.

The public option's low-cost structure would allow it to underprice private insurers. People would understandably drop their private coverage and sign up for the cheaper public plan.

As private insurance companies lost customers to government health insurance they would be forced to raise the price of the policies they sell – driving even more people to the public option.

You get it. Eventually, everyone would move from the private insurance companies to government health insurance. The private companies would shut down and all their employees and contractors would lose their jobs.

So when candidates claim their public option plans are alternatives to ""Medicare-for-all,"" they're not being honest. In time, the public option would turn into “Medicare-for-all.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is wrong to claim that his public option would ""allow people to choose"" the coverage that best suits them.

At least South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has admitted that his public option plan would ""create a natural glide-path"" to ""Medicare-for-all."" Give him points for honesty.

So far the Democratic presidential hopefuls have managed to paper over the differences between their health care plans. But the more candidates talk, the more Americans realize that ""Medicare-for-all"" and the ""public option"" are just two different blueprints for total government control.

Once private insurance companies were eliminated there would be nothing to stop the federal government from raising premiums and taxes and cutting insurance benefits. And we, the American people, would have nowhere else to turn to get needed health insurance.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who promised to sue CNN and the Daily Beast, said this week on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that the only way to hold the ""corrupt"" media accountable is to challenge them in federal court.

Nunes first threatened legal action on Friday, after both outlets published stories claiming the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee had met with Ukranian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in Vienna in 2018 to push for an investigation into Hunter and Joe Biden. Both stories cite former Rudy Guliani associate, Lev Parnas, who was indicted in October for conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations, prompting Nunes to question the validity of the source.

""I've been used to this for the last three years,"" Nunes told Fox News. ""The House Intelligence Committee Republicans, we continue to expose Democrat corruption over and over again. And what always happens is right when we expose them... they go out to kill the messenger.""

""So this week -- another fake news story. The problem with this week's fake news story is -- we actually caught them,"" he continued. ""And we caught them badly and it also involves criminal activity... We are going to take both CNN and the Daily Beast likely into federal court, right after Thanksgiving and we hope they cooperate.""

The Daily Beast originally broke the story about Nunes' alleged meeting on Thursday, citing Parnas' lawyer Ed MacMahon as their source. The Beast also cites congressional travel records which it claims shows Nunes traveled to Europe from Nov. 30 to Dec. 3, 2018, along with three of his aides. CNN followed up with an article on Saturday, citing Parnas' other lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, who said Nunes was put in touch with officials who could help him dig up dirt on the Bidens.

NUNES AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING: INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 'HIJACKED' BY 'PARTISAN EXTREMISTS' TO REMOVE THIS PRESIDENT

Nunes told Fox News it was inappropriate for a news organization to take the word of someone who is attempting to smear a congressman, while still under federal indictment.

""It is not OK to work with someone who has been indicted on [a] serious federal crime, to build a media narrative and dirty up a member of Congress,"" he said. ""You’ve seen it, the American people have seen it over the last three years. We out them, and then they come out with a media narrative to try to dirty up the people who are doing the work on behalf of the American people.

""So we hope that CNN and Daily Beast will cooperate with the court,"" Nunes continued. ""They should comply with the subpoenas once we file this and go through different depositions. It should be fun.""

Host Maria Bartiromo asked Nunes if he wished to elaborate further on his involvement in the case, but he declined to go any deeper, saying he would not debate the issue through the media.

""I really want to answer all these questions,"" he said. ""But I think you can understand that I can't compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 percent of the media are totally corrupt. And because this is criminal in nature and because it's so bad, it's so slanderous -- we've got all the facts on our side and we're going to file in federal court, because I’m not going to sit here and try to compete against the media that I have no chance of winning this. I will win in court.""

NUNES SLAMS IMPEACHMENT 'THREE-CARD MONTE,' THEN YIELDS TO SCHIFF FOR 'STORYLINE HOUR'

Nunes did, however, say it's ""likely"" that CNN and the Daily Beast committed criminal activity, and claimed the only way to find out the truth is to have them answer questions under oath.

""It's very likely [they committed a crime], or they're an accessory to it,"" he said. ""So none of this is true... We will get to all the facts when it's filed in court. But somehow they're either witting or unwitting of listening to somebody who's been indicted and not only that, but it's their lawyers. So you're talking about third and fourth hand hearsay to do what? To dirty up the leader of the Republicans on the Intelligence Committee that just destroyed their complete narrative that they've been pushing.""

Nunes provided a statement to Breitbart on Friday when news of a lawsuit first broke, calling the charges ""demonstrably false"" and ""reckless.""

“These demonstrably false and scandalous stories published by the Daily Beast and CNN are the perfect example of defamation and reckless disregard for the truth,” Nunes told Breitbart News. “Some political operative offered these fake stories to at least five different media outlets before finding someone irresponsible enough to publish them. I look forward to prosecuting these cases, including the media outlets, as well as the sources of their fake stories, to the fullest extent of the law. I intend to hold the Daily Beast and CNN accountable for their actions. They will find themselves in court soon after Thanksgiving.”"

On Friday, nearly 260 groups sent a letter requesting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., pursue policies like the Green New Deal instead of ""incremental or isolated policy tweaks.""

""We are also prepared to hold legislators accountable if they fail to support bold action,"" the letter, signed by groups such as CODEPINK, said. ""With millions of lives at stake, we need leaders in Congress with the courage to move beyond the decades-old political status quo that protects corporate interests over the health and well-being of our communities.""

The groups' letter came amid an internal debate in which Democrats wrestled with how ambitious their climate proposals should be. Activists' fears likely intensified earlier in November when President Trump filed paperwork to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, a multilateral pact aimed at reducing temperature increases during the century.

WORLD'S THICKEST MOUNTAIN GLACIER IS MELTING, NEW NASA IMAGES REVEAL

The Green New Deal, proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has become a rallying cry for more progressive elements of the party and a symbol of the desire to overcome congressional stagnation on the issue.

In January, the House of Representatives created the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, which Castor chairs, but activists were apparently dissatisfied with the progress made since its launch. Pelosi, who created the panel, faced another round of sit-ins at her D.C. office this week, which ended with several arrests.

According to The Washington Post, the group Extinction Rebellion held a hunger strike in an attempt to force the speaker into a video-recorded meeting. When they realized she was planning to leave D.C., the protesters attempted to storm past her office's entrance and into a broader room where her chief of staff sat.

The protests served as yet another indication of tension between the progressive base and Democratic leadership. Pelosi only created the climate committee after an earlier climate sit-in that took place in her office in 2018. Ocasio-Cortez joined that protest and has since been a leader in challenging establishment Democrats, like former Vice President Joe Biden, to pursue more ambitious proposals.

Friday's letter critiqued the Select Committee's efforts as self-defeating.

""By framing its request for input myopically, the Select Committee has created a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the solutions it is likely to recommend only partially address the climate crisis,"" the letter said.

ABBY HUNTSMAN CHALLENGES JANE FONDA ON 'FANTASTIC' GREEN NEW DEAL: 'NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN'

Protesters also occupied Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg's office on Friday, similarly demanding bolder action than what the 2020 hopeful outlined in his climate plan from September. That event was planned by the Sunrise Movement, a group that has cooperated with Ocasio-Cortez in pushing her Green New Deal.

Meanwhile in D.C, actress Jane Fonda led yet another climate demonstration in which police arrested protesters after they blocked traffic in front of the Supreme Court. Fonda, a vocal activist, has been arrested at least four times this year.

It's unclear how Pelosi intended to react, as her caucus has also been pushing a high-profile impeachment inquiry that included public hearings this week. She previously downplayed the potential of passing the Green New Deal, noting that she couldn't ""say we're going to take that and pass it.""

More than 150 House Democrats have signed on to legislation introduced Thursday that would seek net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. A similar bill emerged in July utilizing a carbon tax.

Although leading presidential candidates have endorsed the Green New Deal, the candidates and congressional Democrats could scale back their climate advocacy in an attempt to shore up moderates before 2020. While existing plans likely inspired hope among activists, that attempt at moderation might inflame the progressive base.

Friday's letter called for sweeping action beyond just emissions reductions.

Joe Biden: We're asking, Lindsey Graham. They have him under they're thumb right now. They know he knows if he comes out against Trump, he's got a real tough road for reelection. Number one, I am disappointed. And quite frankly, I'm angered by the fact he knows me. He knows my son. He knows there's nothing to this. Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life.

Male Speaker: What do you say to him?

Joe Biden: I say -- Lindsey, I just -- I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing. Are you? I mean, my Lord?

Brian Kilmeade: My Lord. That's how he ended it. And from the minute I saw that on another network, I wanted to find out what Senator Graham thought about that, who said in the past, ""I like Joe Biden,"" and more. But he's going to investigate Hunter Biden, and he wants to investigate what was going on in the Ukraine in 2014 and 2016. Senator Graham, well, welcome back. What's your response to that?

Lindsey Graham: Well, number one, I do like Joe Biden. He's -- I've traveled the world with him. I like him, I think he's a very decent fellow. He's had a lot of tragedy in his life. But I'm not going to create a country where only Republicans get investigated. There's a lot of corruption in the Ukraine. They're an important ally. I thought Mueller would end this, but Adam Schiff is created a process in the house that's un-American, dangerous to the Presidency. And we're going to ask questions of Hunter Biden's role and getting the prosecutor fired. He served on a company, Burisma, as a board member. He received $50,000 a month. For what? I don't know. After the investigation of the company was opened by the prosecutor general's office in the Ukraine. Hunter Biden called his friends in the State Department, Joe Biden called the president, the Ukraine, Persico , three times in10 days. Went to the Ukraine in March. The investigation began February the 4th. The prosecutor was fired.

I want to know the transcripts of the phone call between the Vice President and the President of the Ukraine. I want to know what Hunter Biden was doing talking to the State Department. His business partners and blue strategies also contacted at the State Department. The question is, did Hunter Biden use his political influence to stop the investigation of a gas company he was sitting on a as a board member? The president of Burisma was Zlochevsky, the former environmental minister in the Yanukovich administration, who was identified by the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine in 2015 as being one of the most corrupt people in the Ukraine.

The question is, did one of the most corrupt people in the Ukraine hired Joe -- Hunter Biden to be a board member on a gas company and Hunter Biden knows nothing about the gas business, as an insurance policy to protect his company in situations like this. I don't know what happened. I do know this. We're not going to allow the House to investigate Trump endlessly and not ask questions about all corruption in the Ukraine. Was there a corrupt motive behind Hunter Biden's interference contacting of the State Department after the gas company was being investigated?

Nothing to do with friendship. When Joe Biden was the vice presidential nominee in 2008, he tore the bark off John McCain and Sarah Palin, nobody asked him, hey, will that hurt your friendship. It hurt my relationship because that's the job he was assigned. My job is to make sure that people I represent in South Carolina, that their voice is heard. Nobody in the media really gives a damn that Hunter Biden was sitting on this board receiving $50,000 a month. Nobody in the media really gives a damn that Hunter Biden weighed in with the State Department after the company came under investigation. They tell me political fat looked at this. What a joke.

There has been no investigation regarding the role of the Vice President, Hunter Biden and getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired after the investigation of Permisa -- Burisma, whatever the name of the company is. I'm going to make sure that those questions are asked. And finally, why am I doing this? When House Republicans tried to ask these questions about the role of Hunter Biden in the investigation of the gas company, they were shut down. So, I'm going to ask. If it were up me, we would have ended this a long time ago on both sides.

Brian Kilmeade: Senator, well said. You have some legitimate questions and you put your job over your friendship. So, he says that you're being held hostage basically by Donald Trump, that if you go against Trump, you're not going to get reelected. What's your response to that?

Lindsey Graham: It's not going to work. It's not going to work with me. I supported legislation which Chris Coons to make sure that Mueller could not be fired without cause. I didn't think the President was going to fire Mueller, but he said some things that bothered me. I didn't know what the Trump campaign did regarding Russia. I supported the idea that Mueller would be a fair guy to look. I trusted Mueller. He spent two years and $25 million. He found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. And he made no recommendations for prosecution based on obstruction of justice allegations. I thought that would end it.

What Schiff is doing is dangerous to the Presidency. He's not allowing Republicans to call witnesses. The President's counsel can't participate in the Intel Committee hearings. You can't ask any questions about whether or not Hunter Biden interfered in an investigation at the gas company where he received $50,000 a month as a board member. I want to know what Joe Biden asked of the Ukrainian government after the raid on Burisma. I hope there's nothing there. Reveal the transcripts. Trump released the transcripts. All I'm asking is that somebody look at this line of inquiry. It does look very suspicious to me. The conflict of interest is obvious with Hunter Biden being on that board. So Checci was named the most corrupt person in the Ukraine by the U.S. ambassador in 2015. They hired Hunter Biden by 2014. Burmese -- Burisma did. Was that an insurance policy to protect them against investigations? I don't know. Blue Strategies weighed in with the State Department after the raid on the gas company. Who did they talk to and what did they ask? Hunter Biden's business partner met directly with John Kerry. What was that all about? I don't believe political factors is the end of the inquiry. Somebody needs to look at this. The House is not allowing these questions to be asked. I will make sure they're asking the Senate.

Brian Kilmeade: Well, we know this. He knows nothing about what he was doing over there, but he was golfing with Archer, his partner over there in the Hamptons.

Lindsey Graham: When did he know it? What did he do? And he's a friend. I mean, you know, it's up to him if he wants the friendship to continue. I hope it will continue. But don't expect me -- you know, Chris Coons, I work with a lot. You know, I work with you to protect Mueller. You're going to rally around Joe Biden's campaign. I understand that politically. But I can promise you that when Joe Biden was doing his job as the Democratic nominee for vice president, going after McCain and Palin. Nobody ask him about is the friendship in question. So it is obvious to me that Hunter Biden did some things that need to be looked at to stop the investigation of a company. He was receiving $50,000 a month from in the Ukraine. And the president that company was one of the most corrupt people in the entire country, according to the U.S. government.

Brian Kilmeade: So Joe Biden called out Lindsey Graham said basically he feels bad for many, is angered by his action. Lindsey Graham said --

Lindsey Graham: Don't feel bad about me. Don't worry about me. I am fine, Joe. You're a good man. You lived a very consequential life. You're running for president. You're sitting on the sidelines as the Democratic Party takes a sledgehammer to Trump and his family and his life in 2014. George can't contact the Biden team to raise the conflict of interest his son had being on the board with a Burisma and they said nothing. They basically -- Joe was grieving and I understand that. But the conflict --

Brian Kilmeade: Senator, we actually pulled -- I got his chair -- two things, Chris Coons said this about you, I guess this is what you're referring to. Delaware senator took Joe Biden's spot when he went to become vice president. Senator Coons, Lindsey Graham is abandoning his friendship with Biden by doing Trump's dirty work. Do you want to respond to that specifically?

Lindsey Graham: Yeah. Chris, you're a good man. I like working with you, but we're not going to have it. We're not going to play the game like you want to play. You asked me to join with you to protect Mueller from an investigation that I thought needed to be had. Now you're shutting down legitimate questions about the role of Hunter Biden regarding a prosecution of a company he served on. You're asking us to ignore an obvious conflict of interest. It's not going to work that way.

My friendship with these people are not going to keep me from asking questions that somebody needs to ask. I represent the people of South Carolina. Every time I go out in the community, people wanting to know when we're going to look at what happened with the. Here's what the allegation basically is against the Bidens. Hunter Biden served on a board owned by the most corrupt person in the Ukraine receiving $50,000 a month. And he knows nothing about the gas business. And when the company was being investigated in the president's house was being graded, Hunter Biden started calling the State Department. Joe Biden made three phone calls in 10 days to the president of the Ukraine, went over in March to meet with the president of Ukraine and they fired the guy investigating Hunter Biden's company. We're not going to give them a pass on this. They opened up this can of worms about corruption in the Ukraine. They're alleging the president denied aid to the Ukraine cause he wanted the Bidens investigated a political opponent. There was a quid pro quo for it. I don't see that. I don't see that being proven.

Brian Kilmeade: I want you to hear Lindsey Graham talk in July 2015 with The Huffington Post about Joe Biden.

Lindsey Graham: I think in it, Meyer Joe Biden as a person. There's probably you've got a problem that you need to do some self-evaluation. Because what's not to like? I called them after Beau died and he basically said, well, Beau was my soul for a long time. He came to my ceremony. He said some of the most incredibly heartfelt things that anybody could ever say to me, and he is the nicest person that I've ever met in politics.

Male Speaker: Is that right:

Lindsey Graham: He is as good a man as God ever created. And we don't agree on much.

Brian Kilmeade: So that that's what he was contrasting risk.

Lindsey Graham: Yeah. So everything I said was about Joe Biden the first -- I've traveled the world with him. He lost his son, Beau, who I knew. I don't think I've ever talked to Hunger Biden. If I have I don't remember it. The bottom line here is I'm the senator from South Carolina. I don't remember Joe Biden being asked, why if you're such good friends with John McCain, why are you saying all these things about McCain candidacy for president? Nobody in their right mind would suggest that Joe Biden, because of his friendship with John McCain, could not make a case against John McCain being president and for Barack Obama. He did. He did it effectively. They tore the bark off John McCain.

Now, here's where I find myself. Your son is serving on a gas company in the Ukraine, making $50,000 a month. An obvious conflict of interest. That gas company gets investigated for corruption. Did your son weigh in and use his political influence to stop that investigation? President Trump wants to find out about corruption in the Ukraine. And if there's nothing there. Fine. I hope there's not. I want the transcripts of the phone calls between Biden and the president of the Ukraine. I want somebody other than political fact, look at whether or not Hunter Biden used his influence to stop the investigation of a company he receiving $50,000 a month compensation in the Ukraine based on the gas business, which you knew nothing about.

Brian Kilmeade: Senator, are you acting as the chairman of Judiciary or are you doing President Trump's dirty work or does the president intimidate you into doing what he wants you to do?

Lindsey Graham: I'm doing this because somebody needs to do it. When I supported legislation to make sure Mueller could be fired, the Trump world didn't like that much.

I was okay with what I did because I thought somebody outside of politics needs to look at the Trump campaign's interaction with Russia, if any. There was one person that could clear Trump or find him guilty of wrongdoing. To me, that was Mueller. I supported that investigation and I was the hero of the town. Standing up for the rule of law. Good old, Lindsey. Now they're playing on a friendship.

They're trying to intimidate me from asking questions that somebody should ask. Ukraine is a corrupt country. I get that. Why Hunger Biden was on his board. I don't know. If Joe Biden didn't know, I find it hard to believe. What did he know and when did you know it? Did his son, Hunter Biden use his influence with the State Department in the Obama administration to call off the dogs investigating a company that he was serving on in the Ukraine? The president this company was known to be one of the most corrupt people in the country. Why were you on his board to begin if Joe Biden's job was to clean up corrupt.

Brian Kilmeade: There's legitimate questions that nobody's asking. They always press. They preface every question with there's no corruption there. And then they go on and move on. So you're asking those questions because you're doing your job.

Lindsey Graham: My friendship with Joe Biden, if they can't withstand me doing my job is not the friendship I thought we had. Everything I said about him in 2015 is true. I admire him as a person. I think he's always trying to do right by the country. I think that -- I think he's made a lot of bad policy choices. But as a person, I like him. He spoke at Senator Thurmond's funeral. I have. I have stood up for him against allegations he was a racist. That's absurd. But we're not going to allow a system in America where only one side gets looked at. These are legitimate questions. What did Hunter Biden do in February the 4th? Brian, this is important. The prosecutor general announces an investigation of Burisma, the gas company. And that's when Hunter Biden started contacting the State Department. And after that contact, Joe Biden made three phone calls in 10 days about the prosecutor. Now, I want to know what they were talking about.

Brian Kilmeade: That's it. Senator, you had to sit there for two days and take personal attacks from Joe Biden and all his supporters and you just sounded off. And I think you --

Lindsey Graham: I'm disappointed in him. He wants to play the game where I work with him to make sure Trump gets investigated, but all of a sudden, when I ask questions that are just -- a lot of Republicans want to know the answer to, I think every American will know the answer to, all that and the bad guy. That's not going to work with me.

Brian Kilmeade: Senator Graham, I get it. I agree. Thanks so much for using this vehicle to get your side of the story out. Back in a moment."

In an interview on ""Fox and Friends"" last week, Trump predicted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., would not see the impeachment process through to a vote.

""No, I don’t expect it,"" he said at the conclusion of two weeks of impeachment hearings, ""I think it’s very hard for them to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing.""

The Hill reported on Saturday that a House Democratic leadership aide called it “fantasy land” to think that there wouldn't be a vote on the House floor.

Democratic strategist Doug Schoen suggested that he hopes that the president is right.

""I am praying for censure. It can turn what could be a loss into a certain victory,"" he said, arguing that Pelosi should forgo impeachment and instead vote to publicly reprimand the president.

""While the Democratic electorate is almost unanimously in favor of impeachment, swing voters in swing states... are decidedly mixed, if not negative,"" the polling expert explained on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive.""

""And given that states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Florida -- ones the Democrats have to win in some combination to win the presidential election, it's hard for me to see that impeachment is anything but a very problematic issue for the party,"" he argued.

Paradoxically, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, who has been harshly critical of the Democrats' impeachment effort, said that he hopes that the House votes and moves the process to the Senate.

""I'm praying for a trial because it will boomerang terribly on the Democrats and only ensure the president's reelection come November,"" said Jarrett.

""Let's start exposing some of these malignant actions by people, not just [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff, and the whistleblower, but others involved in this as well,"" Jarrett contended. ""This is the witch hunt, the sequel. And it's ten times as preposterous as the original Trump/Russian collusion hoax.""

COULD PELOSI ABANDON IMPEACHMENT EFFORTS?: LEGAL ANALYST PREDICTS SHE MAY

Jarrett argued that if the Senate were to take up a trial of the president, Republicans would be in a position to raise questions over former Vice President Joe Biden's involvement in Ukraine policy, as well as his son Hunter's work with a notoriously corrupt Ukrainian company.

'There's an old saying -- the recoil is more dangerous than the projectile. And the recoil here is Hunter Biden and Joe Biden,"" continued Jarrett. ""I think the more we find out about the machinations of Hunter Biden, who appears increasingly like a prodigious grifter, this is only going to damage his father in his quest to become the next president of United States. I mean, Lindsey Graham is vowing an investigation of the activities of Hunter Biden and by implication, Joe Biden's actions in a quid pro quo.""

Schoen agreed with Jarrett that Joe and Hunter Biden's behavior appeared to have been wildly inappropriate.

""The idea that Burisma, Hunter Biden and Joe Biden didn't know what was going on is ridiculous,"" said Schoen. ""To me, Joe Biden turned the other cheek, turned the other eye, put a bag over his head, whatever. Why did he do that? He had a troubled son who landed a big, lucrative gig, and he was hoping against hope that he could skate through. Well, we're seeing now that that's not the case. I don't know that there was anything that was done that was illegal. It sure smells and it smells really bad.""

Schoen concluded that his party may regret devoting so much time and energy to the impeachment process.

""I also think that we Democrats are losing a huge opportunity because on issues like gun violence prevention, climate change, health care, we have an advantage. We won the midterm elections in 2018 because of the utilization and in part of those issues. And to not take advantage of what people care about, which is real-world day to day problems of our quality of life, and instead, just keep focusing on impeachment. If I were recommending to the Democrats what to do. I'd say vote for censure, get it and move on.""

John Kennedy, R-La., on Sunday slammed the House’s impeachment inquiry into President Trump for chasing after a ""red herring"" when trying to determine whether the president tied foreign aid to Ukraine to an investigation into his political rivals, and he attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for making impeachment proceedings a “political weapon.”

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Kennedy dodged a question by Chris Wallace on whether Trump was asking Ukraine to investigate corruption or to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and instead called out Pelosi for politicizing the impeachment process.

“Speaker Pelosi is acting in a manner that is insincere, even by the standards of Congress,” Kennedy said. “She is turning impeachment into a routine political weapon.”

READ: GORDON SONDLAND'S IMPEACHMENT HEARING OPENING STATEMENT

Kennedy went on to criticize House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s move to bar Republicans from calling witnesses in the impeachment inquiry and “not allowing the president to defend himself.”

A number of Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have commented that the president is welcome to testify before the committee during the impeachment hearings.

On the issue of if there was quid pro quo between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when the president asked his Eastern European counterpart to look into the Ukraine business dealings of Biden and his son Hunter, Kennedy made his feelings clear.

“The quid pro quo is a red herring,” he said. “President Trump asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival. The matter, if proven, would be in the national interest.”

The impeachment inquiry into Trump began when a whistleblower reported that Trump had pushed Zelensky to launch a public investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine — specifically, why the former vice president pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings.

Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his son.

Kennedy’s comments come two days after his fellow Republican senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, sent a letter Thursday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between Biden, his son and Poroshenko.

Graham’s letter, which was released as the final day of public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump wrapped up, asked Pompeo to release a series of documents and transcripts of conversations in 2016 between Biden and Poroshenko in relation to an investigation into Burisma Holdings."

BLOOMBERG UNION FIRES BACK ON BAN TO AVOID INVESTIGATING 2020 DEMS: 'SILENCING JOURNALISTS'

A video released on Sunday by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg marked the official start of the politician/media mogul's 2020 presidential run, Fox News reported.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but then he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Varney said he finds it ironic that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have ""built their campaigns around getting rid of billionaires,"" are now running against ""Bloomberg's mountain of money.""

""Money really talks in politics,"" Varney added.

Warren and Sanders shouldn't be the only ones opposed to a Bloomberg run, however, the Fox Nation host observed -- warning Joe Biden of his new competition.

""Joe Biden can't be happy. Joe occupies the center. But his campaign is lackluster and he's not raising much money. Overnight, Bloomberg has taken over the middle ground.,"" Varney explained.

Varney credited Bloomberg for his deliberately late strategy, but his run ""throws the party into even more chaos,"" he said.

BLOOMBERG CAMPAIGN MANAGER ON 2020: TRUMP IS WINNING

""His strategy is unusual, but very smart. He'll enter the race deliberately late. He'll let his competitors tear each other apart and spend their money and then jump into Super Tuesday in March. California and 14 other states hold primary votes that day. Bloomberg's billions will have an enormous impact,"" Varney said.

""And consider this,"" he added, ""there may be an impeachment trial in the Senate right around that time, March of next year. Senators Warren Sanders, Klobuchar, Booker, Harris. They're not going to be on the campaign trail -- they'll have to be in D.C. passing judgment on the president.""

Bloomberg's run further divides the Democratic Party, Varney explained, and he believes it ""opens the door to a Trump win in 2020.""

""It's hard to believe that Democrats welcome this,"" Varney said.""I can't see the supporters of Warren and Sanders suddenly jumping ship for the $50 billion man. I can't see rural moderates getting behind a candidate who has no time for guns. And I can't see Southerners or Midwesterners supporting a climate warrior.""

""Bloomberg not only splits the party, he throws it into even more chaos. And that means no matter who leads the Democrats next year, the party remains at war with itself.""

BLOOMY THROWS WARREN A LIFELINE

After a brutal six-week stretch, there’s finally some good news for the flagging fortunes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.



In early October, the political press prematurely ordained the Massachusetts Democrat as her party’s front-runner. But Warren had landed splay-footed. She was nowhere near ready to deal with the scrutiny after months of fawning coverage and deference from her rivals. It’s been brutal.



The proximate cause of Warren’s woes was said to have been her triple-dip goofs on health insurance: No plan, a politically preposterous plan and then a rapid walk-back under pressure.



Adding to her woes have been problems with her biographical claims, including a dispute over whether she really was fired for being pregnant as a young woman and now over her denial that her children attended private school.



That all left Warren stuck between emboldened rivals to her right, particularly front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and a surging South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and her longtime frenemy to her left, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.



Underpinning all of Warren’s problems is an understanding among many Democrats that she represents a special risk to her party as a potential nominee. Her out-of-the-mainstream ideology combined with a demeanor so dour that she makes Hillary Clinton seem cheerful is a potent combination for Republican message makers.



As House Democrats prepare for a brutal fight to retain the moderate, suburban swing districts that delivered them the lower chamber in 2018 and as party strategists survey the swing-state map, they have to see Warren as a worst-case scenario right now.



That understanding helps explain how Biden keeps his national lead and how Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in her previous strongholds of Iowa and New Hampshire.



But the same pundit-politico Democratic intelligentsia that has of late suddenly realized Warren’s massive defects still maintains its dislike of Biden. Biden, 77, is said to be too old, too gaffe prone and too much of an insider to be a good nominee. In the crucial “Morning Joe” and snarky Twitter primary, Biden is still mostly a punchline. As his puny fundraising shows, Democratic elites are still down on Sheriff Joe. And an establishmentarian front-runner without the backing of said establishment is as out of place as Corn Pop on a Wilmington city pool high dive.



Riding into the fray amid a cannonade of cash is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, with $30 million Friday, has already set a new record for single-day campaign spending.



But other than the owners of local television stations and the realtors selling vacation homes to his consultants, who stands to benefit from Bloomberg’s big buy in?



Why Warren, of course.



This isn’t complicated, folks. Just as Biden has benefited from the competition between Warren and Sanders — two hard-left, New England senators in their seventies — Warren will be aided by the rivalry between two moderate, Mid-Atlantic 77-year-olds.



It’s still unknowable what Bloomberg’s money can buy him. His forerunner, billionaire investor Tom Steyer, has been a fizzle in a tartan tie. But Bloomberg is a more formidable candidate, and not just for his service as mayor of America’s largest city.



As a media mogul and survivor of the same tabloid press that produced Donald Trump, Bloomberg has more moxie. Plus, he has more than one necktie.



How big will Bloomberg open? Will he draw from Biden more than Buttigieg? Will he be able to elbow onto the December debate stage? Can he connect with the black voters who have succored Biden?



That all remains to be seen. But we know for sure that Bloomberg is a godsend for Warren.



Aside from dividing the support for her rivals, Bloomberg, erstwhile Republican and Wall Street enthusiast, makes the perfect foil. She’s been talking for a year about not letting billionaires buy the election and Bloomberg rides into the arena blasting millions into the stands like free t-shirts out of a slingshot.



Democrats may ultimately choose to ignore Bloomberg’s bid, but for as long as he is a fascination, he’s helping Warren.



THE RULEBOOK: EVERYONE GETS TWO

“The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 62



TIME OUT: SAME WITH AXE BODY SPRAY

NYT: “When a bird preens its feathers, it uses a little of nature’s own pomade: an oil made by glands just above the tail. This oil helps clean and protect the bird’s plumage, but also contains a delicate bouquet of scents. To other birds — potential mates or would-be rivals — these smells carry many messages, not unlike the birdsongs and fancy feathers that are more obvious to human observers. These scents may signal that a bird would be dangerous to encounter or might be ready to mate, or any number of other cues. However, new research … suggests that these odoriferous messages may not be entirely of the bird’s own making. In a study published last month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, biologists reported that microbes living peacefully on the birds’ oil glands may play an important role in making the scent molecules involved. That implies that the birds’ microbiomes may influence both the smell and the behavior it provokes in other birds.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

In Friday’s edition of I’ll Tell You What, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss the week that was on Capitol Hill, a snoozer of a debate in Atlanta and a road trip comedy with President Trump and Senator Romney. And there's trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



BLOOMBERG NEWS WILL AVOID REPORTS ON OWNER DURING CAMPAIGN

WaPo: “Bloomberg News will stop writing unsigned editorials and its reporters will avoid investigating the personal life and finances of its owner, Mike Bloomberg, as the news organization seeks to avoid conflicts of interest in covering Bloomberg’s newly announced candidacy for president. In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations. … Most notably, [Micklethwait] said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’”



Biden can’t remember veep prospects’ names - NY Post: “Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has at least four women in mind as potential running mates — but had a hard time remembering their names when an Iowa voter asked him Friday who he would choose. … Biden then ran through a list of four prominent Democrats — without using any of their names. ‘The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware,’ he began, an apparent reference to Sally Yates… ‘The leader of the, uh, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman,’ he continued — meaning Stacey Abrams… ‘The two senators from the state of New Hampshire,’ he concluded. That would be Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Abrams … is widely seen as a top veep prospect in 2020. Yates, Shaheen, and Hassan have not been cited as potential running mates before now.”



Buttigieg proposes long-term care benefits for older Americans - Fox News: “Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Monday rolled out a plan to ‘promote dignity and security in retirement’ through additional regular payments to older Americans, along with imposing a payroll tax on the wealthiest Americans to ‘protect Social Security forever.’ The South Bend, Ind., mayor said his father had been admitted to a hospital last winter for an undisclosed illness, and died this past January. He said a social worker told him the best option for long-term care would be to deplete their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid. … On Monday, his campaign announced plans to establish Long-Term Care America, a program providing people 65 and older with a benefit of $90 per day. ‘Over 11 million will receive benefits from the program throughout their lifetime,’ according to the proposal.”



Black voters: Representation doesn’t mean change - NYT: “Moderate black voters, particularly older ones whose support has helped former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintain his lead atop most primary polls, pointed to the election of President Trump, and said nominating the candidate they saw as most capable of ending his administration was a moral priority above all others. And some black voters on the left — particularly younger ones — are disappointed by some aspects of former President Barack Obama’s legacy and have embraced the idea that supporting a candidate who is willing to upend unjust systems is more important than choosing one from their own community. … The sentiment among members of the black electorate has squeezed some candidates from both sides, and is especially meaningful for Mr. [Cory] Booker and Ms. [Kamala] Harris, two black candidates looking to replicate Mr. Obama’s electoral playbook.”



Booker wins praise but no support - WaPo: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”



MULVANEY SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY WITHHOLDING UKRAINE AID

NYT: “Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, asked officials in the budget office after President Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president whether there was a legal justification for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, according to two people briefed on an internal White House review. The discussions, which took place via email in August, came after the hold on the $391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said. The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats’ impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.”



House Intel has video, audio recordings from Giuliani associate - ABC News: “The House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who reportedly played a key role in assisting him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week. ‘We have subpoenaed Mr. Parnas and Mr. [Igor] Fruman for their records. We would like them to fully comply with those subpoenas,’ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN Sunday, with a committee spokesperson adding they would not elaborate beyond the chairman's comments.”



Schiff says Dems plan to keep moving forward - WaPo: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday that his panel will press ahead with its impeachment report even though key witnesses have not testified, in the latest signal that Democrats are moving swiftly in their probe of President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’”



Vulnerable Dems worry about constituent reactions at home - Politico: “Vulnerable Democrats are watching in horror as GOP impeachment attacks deluge their districts back home. And they want a much stronger counteroffensive from their own party and its allies. Some of those Democrats raised their concerns with party leaders this week as they prepared to leave for Thanksgiving recess, fearing that voters will be bombarded by anti-impeachment ads as families gather around the TV for parades and football, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. GOP-aligned outside groups have spent roughly $8 million on TV spots this cycle in battleground districts… The vast majority of those ads specifically hammer Democrats over impeachment. Meanwhile, swing-district Democrats are receiving little reinforcement from their own party or even other liberal coalitions.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If you jump back and forth between Fox News, Politico, and CNN you would think the impeachment hearings occurred on alternate universes. Witness X is the best thing since sliced bread, say the Dems and their Media allies. Witness X is a bomb thrower and anti-American, say the Republicans. I tend to believe that nobody has a constitutional right to a federal job. If they the Deep Statists can’t follow the President’s lead, they should follow the lead or resign. How do you know which side to believe (other than reading only Half Time Report 24/7)??” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.



[Ed. note: Did you ever hear the one about the blind men trying to describe an elephant? One said it was a snake, one said it was a rope, one said it was the trunk of a tree. It all depended on where they stood. I will say that Fox News’ coverage — helmed by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum — has done a very fine job of showing you the whole elephant. But I take your point about the overall coverage. I encourage people to do a few things when it comes to navigating the political press. First, mostly try to ignore rank partisans. They’re usually boring anyway. Second, seek out good, in-depth reporting first. I start my day with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and go from there. Third, remember that nobody has a monopoly on the truth. American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.]

TACOS. IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN’T DO?

KOLD: “An Arizona man claimed a taco helped save his life after a near-miss with a stray bullet. KOLD reported that a Tucson, Arizona named Ryan Bishop man said he feels lucky to be alive after a bullet came close to causing him serious injuries and possibly death while he was driving. Bishop told KOLD that, just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, he was driving down Houghton Road when the driver's window of his vehicle shattered. … Bishop said he got a safe distance away and pulled over to call police. That's when he said he saw a bullet. … Bishop said he normally drives with his windows down and his arm on the window ledge, exactly where the bullet hit the vehicle. ‘I'm pretty sure [eating a] taco saved my life or at least stopped my arm from getting blown apart,’ he said. ‘I had the window closed because I didn’t want pieces of the taco flying around.’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“This episode and others have brought me to the highly self-serving conclusion that nothing parents do alters a child’s character anyway, so there is no need to fret that some misdirected pedagogy or slip of the tongue will forever ruin him.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, 1990.

President Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, “I would like you to do us a favor” during their July 25 phone call. This involved probing corruption, including at Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company with unusual ties to Hunter Biden and his father, former Vice President Joe Biden. At least 11 times, Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have said that they felt neither pressured nor blackmailed into launching such an investigation, which they ultimately never did.

And the 55-day pause in lethal military aid, while Team Trump evaluated Zelensky’s commitment to his anti-corruption promises, ended on Sept. 11, when assistance reached Kiev. As U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified Wednesday, Trump told him what he wanted from Ukraine: “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.”

Compare those innocuous facts with this chilling outline of Watergate, which began with actual crimes.

On June 17, 1972, members of the White House “Plumbers Unit,” which plugged news leaks, broke into the headquarters of the Democrat National Committee in Washington, D.C.’s Watergate office complex. Bernard Barker, Virgilio Gonzalez, Eugenio Martinez, James McCord and Frank Sturgis were caught red-handed stealing documents and installing illegal wiretaps. Their supervisors soon also were arrested, namely White House aide E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy, a general counsel at CREEP — the Committee to Re-elect the President.

The Washington Post called the break-in part of “a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage conducted on behalf of the Nixon re-election effort.” This confirmed that Watergate was no one-off stunt. It was a cavalcade of electoral lawbreaking.

Compare the innocuous facts regarding Trump's call with the Ukraine president with this chilling outline of Watergate, which began with actual crimes.

Most of this nefarious enterprise was the cover-up that quickly ensued, with President Richard Milhous Nixon at the helm.

To encourage the burglars to shut up about the break-in — and their September 1971 dirt-digging breach of the Los Angeles office of Dr. Lewis Fielding, psychiatrist to Pentagon Papers' chief leaker Daniel Ellsberg — Team Nixon paid them “hush money.” This constituted conspiracy and obstruction of justice.

When the burglars demanded more money to clam up, White House Counsel John Dean entered the Oval Office on March 21, 1973. He hoped that Nixon would stop digging himself into a rapidly collapsing hole and perhaps beg the American people to forgive an overzealous prank that got way out of hand.

“We have a cancer within — close to the presidency, that’s growing,” Dean told Nixon. “It grows geometrically now, because it compounds itself.” Dean then explained that the burglars wanted more cash, to keep their lips zipped.

“How much money do you need?” Nixon asked Dean, as captured on the recording system that would undo the president.

Dean answered: “I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years” — about $5.9 million today.

Rather than back down, Nixon doubled down.

“We could get that,” Nixon said. “You could get a million dollars. You could get it in cash. I know where it could be gotten.” Dean also proposed laundering this money, “And that means you have to go to Vegas with it or a bookmaker in New York City.”

Forthwith, the burglars got their greenbacks. In fact, as Woodward and Bernstein later reported, “Within 12 hours of the Oval office discussion, Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt Jr. received $75,000 cash.” A July 5, 1974 FBI Watergate summary offers this eerie detail: “Hunt’s wife died on Dec. 8, 1972, in an aircraft crash in Chicago. Bureau agents recovered $10,000 in one hundred dollar bills in Mrs. Hunt’s purse at the time of the crash.”

Nixon’s conspiracy to obstruct justice had reached epic proportions long before this million-dollar conversation. Nixon insisted publicly that he knew nothing about the cover-up or hush money until Dean alerted him on March 21, 1973. In truth, the final, fatal “Smoking Gun Tape” revealed that the supposedly clueless Nixon ordered the cover-up nearly nine months earlier. On June 23, 1972, just six days after the break-in, Nixon commanded that the CIA torpedo the FBI’s fledgling probe.

White House chief of staff Harry Robbins “H.R. Bob” Haldeman suggested to Nixon, “the way to handle this now is for us to have [CIA official Vernon] Walters call [acting FBI chief] Pat Gray and just say, ‘Stay the hell out of this.'""

Nixon concurred and instructed that the CIA “should call the FBI in and say that ‘We wish for the country, don’t go any further into this case, period!’”

The U.S. Supreme Court ordered this recorded conversation and others publicized. Nixon released the Smoking Gun Tape on August 5, 1974. His remaining support among House Republicans imploded. Nixon resigned four days later.

How did the House of Representatives' behavior then compare with today?

On Feb. 6, 1974, the House voted 410-4 to launch Nixon’s impeachment. Fully 98 percent of Republicans decided to commence a GOP president’s impeachment.

Conversely, when the House voted 232-196 on Oct. 31 to advance an impeachment inquiry against Trump, exactly 0 percent of Republicans chose to begin impeachment against a GOP president.

If Nancy Pelosi truly believes that Ukraine-o-rama is “so much worse” than Watergate, she needs much more than an 11-day, book-filled vacation.

Calling the evidence against the president ""overwhelming, unchallenged and damning,"" Schiff nevertheless asserted that investigative work would continue, and left open the possibility that Democrats would hold additional hearings. But all scheduled public hearings before Schiff's panel wrapped up on a testy note last week, and no new proceedings are planned.

""As required under House Resolution 660, the Committees are now preparing a report summarizing the evidence we have found this far, which will be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee soon after Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess,"" Schiff wrote in a letter to congressional colleagues.

He noted that the report ""will catalog the instances of non-compliance with lawful subpoenas as part of our report to the Judiciary Committee, which will allow that committee to consider whether an article of impeachment based on obstruction of Congress is warranted along with an article or articles based on this underlying conduct or other presidential misconduct. Such obstruction was the basis of the third article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon.""

In a worrying omen for moderate Democrats in swing districts that could have factored into Schiff's decision, polls have shown that independents are souring on the impeachment process. Fifty percent of independents questioned in an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted Nov. 11-15 did not support impeaching and removing Trump from office, with just 42 percent backing such a move. That’s a slight dip in support compared with the previous NPR/PBS/Marist poll – conducted the first week in October – when support stood at 45 percent.

TRUMP CALLS FOR SENATE TRIAL, SEEKS WHISTLEBLOWER AND SCHIFF AS IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES

Once it receives Schiff's report, the House Judiciary Committee has the option of drafting articles of impeachment outright or holding further hearings. Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in any potential Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such proceedings.

But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

Fox News reported last week that Democrats were considering four articles of impeachment against the president: Abuse of power, bribery, contempt of Congress, and obstruction of justice.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House last Thursday, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

""Frankly, I want a trial,"" Trump declared Friday on “Fox & Friends.”

""Frankly, I want a trial."" — President Trump

Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration. ""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

Should the House approve impeachment articles and trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump’s allies are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats -- including Trump's allegations of corruption against Joe and Hunter Biden involving their Ukraine dealings.

Additionally, Republicans would likely focus on Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and defend the president's push for investigations in that area before releasing any foreign aid. Numerous media outlets, and a Ukrainian court, have confirmed that Ukrainian actors meddled in the election, despite claims by Democrats and many media personalities that the allegations amount to a ""conspiracy theory.""

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

But, Graham indicated that any Senate trial wouldn't be pleasant for at least one Democratic presidential frontrunner. On Thursday, Graham penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between Biden former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

The letter pertained to Biden's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid when he was vice president and in charge of Ukraine policy. The prosecutor was probing Burisma holdings, where Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board despite having little relevant experience.

Already, some witnesses in the impeachment probe have raised concerns about the Biden's dealings in Ukraine.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, for example, testified behind closed doors last month that he had qualms about the younger Biden's role on the board of Burisma. And former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch said she was ""aware"" of a potential issue, because Obama administration officials prepped her for questions about Hunter Biden during her confirmation process.

""I was aware of it because as I told you before in the deposition, there had been a -- in terms of the preparation for my Senate confirmation hearings for Ukraine, there was a question about that and a select answer, so I was aware of it,"" Yovanovitch said.

She added that she was told that if the matter came up, she should refer questions to other departments.

Navy secretary fired over handling, 'lack of candor' in Eddie Gallagher case; SEAL will keep Trident pin, Pentagon says

Defense Secretary Mark Esper fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer on Sunday over his handling of the case of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who posed for a photo next to an Islamic State group terrorist’s corpse in Iraq. Spencer was fired for ""lack of candor"" -- for dishonesty and undermining the military justice system, the senior U.S. official told Fox News.

The controversy swirled around whether the Navy would strip Gallagher of his Trident pin, which is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, a source told Fox News. In July, Gallagher was cleared of serious 2017 war crimes charges in Iraq, including premeditated murder, but convicted on a lesser offense of posing with the corpse of an ISIS fighter. He was demoted from chief petty officer to a 1st class petty officer following his conviction. President Trump this month restored Gallagher’s rank and ordered that the Navy halt its internal review of his actions.

Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley spoke to Trump on Friday with the intention of persuading the president to allow the Trident review board to go forward with its inquiry. Instead, Esper learned that Spencer previously and privately proposed to the White House – contrary to Spencer’s public position – to restore Gallagher’s rank and let him retire with his Trident pin, the Pentagon said. When Esper recently asked, Spencer confirmed that he'd never informed the defense secretary about his private proposal.

Spencer had asked Trump to let the Navy review board go forward, promising that the board would, in the end, allow Gallagher to keep his Trident and rank. He effectively suggested he would be willing to fix the results of the board, which is usually comprised of the defendant’s peers, a senior U.S. official told Fox News. Trump rejected the offer.

Esper ordered that Gallagher be allowed to keep his Trident pin, noting that it would be nearly impossible for him to get a fair hearing from the military in light of recent events, a senior official said. Trump late Sunday tweeted he would nominate Kenneth Braithwaite, the current U.S. ambassador to Norway and a retired Navy rear admiral, to replace Spencer. Click here for more on our top story.

Bloomberg officially enters 2020 presidential race - and his media company faces immediate ethics problems

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially launched his 2020 presidential campaign Sunday with the release of a one-minute video. However, his entry into the race has posed a dilemma for the news service that bears his name and editors at Bloomberg have already raised eyebrows with how they say they will approach their coverage.

Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait announced Sunday it will not “investigate” the candidate or any of his Democratic rivals, and Bloomberg Opinion will no longer run unsigned editorials. The entry of Bloomberg into the presidential race also raises potential conflict-of-interest questions involving his extensive business holdings, which go well beyond his news service.

Nunes doubles down on promise to sue CNN and Daily Beast over impeachment coverage

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who promised to sue CNN and the Daily Beast, told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo this week on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that the only way to hold the ""corrupt"" media accountable is to challenge them in federal court.

Nunes first threatened legal action against both news organizations Friday for their coverage of the Trump impeachment inquiry proceedings. Both outlets had published stories claiming the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee had met with Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in Vienna in 2018 to push for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Both stories cite former Rudy Guliani associate Lev Parnas, who was indicted in October for conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations, prompting Nunes to question the validity of the source.

As a result, many of the Democrats competing for their party’s presidential nomination are scrambling to soften their support for this radical restructuring of our health care system or highlighting their opposition to it.

But here’s the truth you won’t hear from the Democratic would-be presidents: Those who say they oppose a government takeover of our health insurance system are simply trying to soothe nervous moderates.

JUSTIN HASKINS: ELIZABETH WARREN IS A SOCIALIST – IF SHE'S THE DEM NOMINEE, THIS HAPPENS IN 2020

In fact, every single Democratic presidential candidate supports a brand of health care reform that will lead to ""Medicare-for-all."" Each just has a different timeline, with a different path on how to get to the same result.

Think of the candidates like a large number of hikers making their way through a dense forest on different trails to reach a waterfall. Some will travel quickly, others more slowly as they encounter different obstacles, but eventually all will get to the same waterfall.

""Medicare-for-all"" is a radical plan to eliminate the private insurance industry and enroll every one of us in a taxpayer-funded government-run health plan – whether we like it or not. Like our income tax system, participation will be mandatory.

At this point 53 percent of Americans support “Medicare-for-all,” according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That's down from a high of 59 percent in March 2018.

In contrast, 65 percent of Americans favor the creation of a new, government-sponsored health plan that would compete against private insurers. This so-called ""public option"" would allow everyone to access affordable health insurance coverage without eliminating private insurance, its supporters say.

The Democratic presidential candidates have been following public opinion. Just look at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. At the first candidate debate, she proudly proclaimed she was ""with Bernie on Medicare-for-all."" On Nov. 1, she unveiled her wildly unrealistic plan to pay for it.

But at last week's debate in Atlanta, Warren didn't join Sanders in his full-throated defense of ""Medicare-for-all."" Instead, she explained how she would gradually transition to a single-payer system during her first term.

Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017. If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Under Warren's plan, 135 million people would be automatically enrolled in a new Medicare-like plan right off the bat, at no cost to them.

This would include ""everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000,"" she said. Every other American would have the option to buy into the plan at a ""modest"" cost.

Warren promises to get ""Medicare-for-all"" legislation passed ""no later than"" her third year in office. Of course, there’s no way to know if the House and Senate would approve her grand plan, no matter how hard she tries to win its passage.

What Warren is proposing is a public option for the first three years of her term – and ""Medicare-for-all"" thereafter. That timeline may be unrealistic – but it may not matter. The public option would invariably result in a government takeover of health insurance.

Proponents of the public option envision reimbursing doctors and hospitals at artificially low rates dictated by the government – typically Medicare's rates, which are about 40 percent below what private insurance pays.

Today hospitals receive just 87 cents for every dollar in costs they incur caring for beneficiaries. Those pennies on the dollar add up. Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017.

If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Government doesn't need to worry about covering its costs. So it can set premiums for the public option below its claims costs. It can make up the difference by dipping into the federal Treasury – or raising taxes on hard-working Americans.

The public option's low-cost structure would allow it to underprice private insurers. People would understandably drop their private coverage and sign up for the cheaper public plan.

As private insurance companies lost customers to government health insurance they would be forced to raise the price of the policies they sell – driving even more people to the public option.

You get it. Eventually, everyone would move from the private insurance companies to government health insurance. The private companies would shut down and all their employees and contractors would lose their jobs.

So when candidates claim their public option plans are alternatives to ""Medicare-for-all,"" they're not being honest. In time, the public option would turn into “Medicare-for-all.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is wrong to claim that his public option would ""allow people to choose"" the coverage that best suits them.

At least South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has admitted that his public option plan would ""create a natural glide-path"" to ""Medicare-for-all."" Give him points for honesty.

So far the Democratic presidential hopefuls have managed to paper over the differences between their health care plans. But the more candidates talk, the more Americans realize that ""Medicare-for-all"" and the ""public option"" are just two different blueprints for total government control.

Once private insurance companies were eliminated there would be nothing to stop the federal government from raising premiums and taxes and cutting insurance benefits. And we, the American people, would have nowhere else to turn to get needed health insurance.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who promised to sue CNN and the Daily Beast, said this week on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that the only way to hold the ""corrupt"" media accountable is to challenge them in federal court.

Nunes first threatened legal action on Friday, after both outlets published stories claiming the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee had met with Ukranian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in Vienna in 2018 to push for an investigation into Hunter and Joe Biden. Both stories cite former Rudy Guliani associate, Lev Parnas, who was indicted in October for conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations, prompting Nunes to question the validity of the source.

""I've been used to this for the last three years,"" Nunes told Fox News. ""The House Intelligence Committee Republicans, we continue to expose Democrat corruption over and over again. And what always happens is right when we expose them... they go out to kill the messenger.""

""So this week -- another fake news story. The problem with this week's fake news story is -- we actually caught them,"" he continued. ""And we caught them badly and it also involves criminal activity... We are going to take both CNN and the Daily Beast likely into federal court, right after Thanksgiving and we hope they cooperate.""

The Daily Beast originally broke the story about Nunes' alleged meeting on Thursday, citing Parnas' lawyer Ed MacMahon as their source. The Beast also cites congressional travel records which it claims shows Nunes traveled to Europe from Nov. 30 to Dec. 3, 2018, along with three of his aides. CNN followed up with an article on Saturday, citing Parnas' other lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, who said Nunes was put in touch with officials who could help him dig up dirt on the Bidens.

NUNES AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING: INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 'HIJACKED' BY 'PARTISAN EXTREMISTS' TO REMOVE THIS PRESIDENT

Nunes told Fox News it was inappropriate for a news organization to take the word of someone who is attempting to smear a congressman, while still under federal indictment.

""It is not OK to work with someone who has been indicted on [a] serious federal crime, to build a media narrative and dirty up a member of Congress,"" he said. ""You’ve seen it, the American people have seen it over the last three years. We out them, and then they come out with a media narrative to try to dirty up the people who are doing the work on behalf of the American people.

""So we hope that CNN and Daily Beast will cooperate with the court,"" Nunes continued. ""They should comply with the subpoenas once we file this and go through different depositions. It should be fun.""

Host Maria Bartiromo asked Nunes if he wished to elaborate further on his involvement in the case, but he declined to go any deeper, saying he would not debate the issue through the media.

""I really want to answer all these questions,"" he said. ""But I think you can understand that I can't compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 percent of the media are totally corrupt. And because this is criminal in nature and because it's so bad, it's so slanderous -- we've got all the facts on our side and we're going to file in federal court, because I’m not going to sit here and try to compete against the media that I have no chance of winning this. I will win in court.""

Nunes did, however, say it's ""likely"" that CNN and the Daily Beast committed criminal activity, and claimed the only way to find out the truth is to have them answer questions under oath.

""It's very likely [they committed a crime], or they're an accessory to it,"" he said. ""So none of this is true... We will get to all the facts when it's filed in court. But somehow they're either witting or unwitting of listening to somebody who's been indicted and not only that, but it's their lawyers. So you're talking about third and fourth hand hearsay to do what? To dirty up the leader of the Republicans on the Intelligence Committee that just destroyed their complete narrative that they've been pushing.""

Nunes provided a statement to Breitbart on Friday when news of a lawsuit first broke, calling the charges ""demonstrably false"" and ""reckless.""

“These demonstrably false and scandalous stories published by the Daily Beast and CNN are the perfect example of defamation and reckless disregard for the truth,” Nunes told Breitbart News. “Some political operative offered these fake stories to at least five different media outlets before finding someone irresponsible enough to publish them. I look forward to prosecuting these cases, including the media outlets, as well as the sources of their fake stories, to the fullest extent of the law. I intend to hold the Daily Beast and CNN accountable for their actions. They will find themselves in court soon after Thanksgiving.”"

NEWT GINGRICH: FIRST THANKSGIVING WASN'T LIKE WHAT YOU WERE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL – HERE'S THE TRUE STORY

Keeping our democracy has always been a challenge. Wars have been fought and more than one million Americans have died to protect our freedom. As President Kennedy said in his inaugural speech, “Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.”

Today, our county is again under assault from forces foreign and domestic. Russia continues its attack on us unabated, from propaganda campaigns to interference in our political campaigns and elections. In addition, we are sorely tested by those who serve not the idea of America but an individual who acts like a tyrannical monarch and puts the wishes of Russian President Vladimir Putin before the best interests of this country.

The confluence of this conflict was on full display during the impeachment hearings with the testimony of three witnesses. Each one is an immigrant who chose to be an American. Their words and deeds represent the best of us.

The first one was former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Her parents fled communist and Nazi regimes and settled in Canada, where Yovanovitch was born, before moving to Connecticut. A career diplomat, Yovanovitch testified that her efforts as ambassador to help Ukraine become a democracy resulted in her removal by President Trump simply because doing her job stymied his agenda.

The second example was Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. Seeking a better life, his family came to the United States from the Soviet Union when he was 3. Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, serves on the National Security Council as the director for European affairs, and he became concerned about Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.

That call, which included mention of investigating the Ukraine connections of Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, occurred while military aid for Ukraine was being held up by the Trump administration, clear evidence of a bribe, according to many. Vindman still serves on the National Security Council but testified that he is now omitted from meetings.

During their testimony, Yovanovitch and Vindman had their loyalty to America questioned. Yet their actions while serving, their decades of public service, and their testimony before Congress prove they put their country first every day.

Finally, Fiona Hill left England because her father, a coal miner, thought America would offer her opportunities England would never provide. Hill, an expert on Russia and Putin, also served on the National Security Council until she resigned, believing she could no longer fulfill her legitimate responsibilities under the Trump administration.

During their testimony, Yovanovitch and Vindman had their loyalty to America questioned by Republican members of the Intelligence Committee. Yet their actions while serving, their decades of public service, and their testimony before Congress prove they put their country first every day. The same cannot be said of their Republican interrogators.

Hill’s opening statement made clear the real threat to our country.

“Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country — and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,” Hill said. “This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.”

She continued, “The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports. It is beyond dispute…

“The Russian government’s goal is to weaken our country — to diminish America’s global role and to neutralize a perceived U.S. threat to Russian interests. President Putin and the Russian security services aim to counter U.S. foreign policy objectives in Europe, including in Ukraine, where Moscow wishes to reassert political and economic dominance.”

She also issued this ominous warning:

“Right now, Russia’s security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We are running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.”

Despite her plea, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee continued to recite Russian propaganda, doing Putin’s work for him. The next morning during an interview, Trump did the same thing. This is a clear and present danger to our country.

""A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on,” said President Kennedy.

The idea of America has always been worth fighting to save. We are the beacon of hope and opportunity in the world. Saving America now is more important than ever.

On Friday, nearly 260 groups sent a letter requesting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., pursue policies like the Green New Deal instead of ""incremental or isolated policy tweaks.""

""We are also prepared to hold legislators accountable if they fail to support bold action,"" the letter, signed by groups such as CODEPINK, said. ""With millions of lives at stake, we need leaders in Congress with the courage to move beyond the decades-old political status quo that protects corporate interests over the health and well-being of our communities.""

The groups' letter came amid an internal debate in which Democrats wrestled with how ambitious their climate proposals should be. Activists' fears likely intensified earlier in November when President Trump filed paperwork to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, a multilateral pact aimed at reducing temperature increases during the century.

WORLD'S THICKEST MOUNTAIN GLACIER IS MELTING, NEW NASA IMAGES REVEAL

The Green New Deal, proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has become a rallying cry for more progressive elements of the party and a symbol of the desire to overcome congressional stagnation on the issue.

In January, the House of Representatives created the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, which Castor chairs, but activists were apparently dissatisfied with the progress made since its launch. Pelosi, who created the panel, faced another round of sit-ins at her D.C. office this week, which ended with several arrests.

According to The Washington Post, the group Extinction Rebellion held a hunger strike in an attempt to force the speaker into a video-recorded meeting. When they realized she was planning to leave D.C., the protesters attempted to storm past her office's entrance and into a broader room where her chief of staff sat.

The protests served as yet another indication of tension between the progressive base and Democratic leadership. Pelosi only created the climate committee after an earlier climate sit-in that took place in her office in 2018. Ocasio-Cortez joined that protest and has since been a leader in challenging establishment Democrats, like former Vice President Joe Biden, to pursue more ambitious proposals.

Friday's letter critiqued the Select Committee's efforts as self-defeating.

""By framing its request for input myopically, the Select Committee has created a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the solutions it is likely to recommend only partially address the climate crisis,"" the letter said.

ABBY HUNTSMAN CHALLENGES JANE FONDA ON 'FANTASTIC' GREEN NEW DEAL: 'NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN'

Protesters also occupied Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg's office on Friday, similarly demanding bolder action than what the 2020 hopeful outlined in his climate plan from September. That event was planned by the Sunrise Movement, a group that has cooperated with Ocasio-Cortez in pushing her Green New Deal.

Meanwhile in D.C, actress Jane Fonda led yet another climate demonstration in which police arrested protesters after they blocked traffic in front of the Supreme Court. Fonda, a vocal activist, has been arrested at least four times this year.

It's unclear how Pelosi intended to react, as her caucus has also been pushing a high-profile impeachment inquiry that included public hearings this week. She previously downplayed the potential of passing the Green New Deal, noting that she couldn't ""say we're going to take that and pass it.""

More than 150 House Democrats have signed on to legislation introduced Thursday that would seek net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. A similar bill emerged in July utilizing a carbon tax.

Although leading presidential candidates have endorsed the Green New Deal, the candidates and congressional Democrats could scale back their climate advocacy in an attempt to shore up moderates before 2020. While existing plans likely inspired hope among activists, that attempt at moderation might inflame the progressive base.

Friday's letter called for sweeping action beyond just emissions reductions.

Full transcript

Joe Biden: We're asking, Lindsey Graham. They have him under they're thumb right now. They know he knows if he comes out against Trump, he's got a real tough road for reelection. Number one, I am disappointed. And quite frankly, I'm angered by the fact he knows me. He knows my son. He knows there's nothing to this. Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life.

Male Speaker: What do you say to him?

Joe Biden: I say -- Lindsey, I just -- I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing. Are you? I mean, my Lord?

Brian Kilmeade: My Lord. That's how he ended it. And from the minute I saw that on another network, I wanted to find out what Senator Graham thought about that, who said in the past, ""I like Joe Biden,"" and more. But he's going to investigate Hunter Biden, and he wants to investigate what was going on in the Ukraine in 2014 and 2016. Senator Graham, well, welcome back. What's your response to that?

Lindsey Graham: Well, number one, I do like Joe Biden. He's -- I've traveled the world with him. I like him, I think he's a very decent fellow. He's had a lot of tragedy in his life. But I'm not going to create a country where only Republicans get investigated. There's a lot of corruption in the Ukraine. They're an important ally. I thought Mueller would end this, but Adam Schiff is created a process in the house that's un-American, dangerous to the Presidency. And we're going to ask questions of Hunter Biden's role and getting the prosecutor fired. He served on a company, Burisma, as a board member. He received $50,000 a month. For what? I don't know. After the investigation of the company was opened by the prosecutor general's office in the Ukraine. Hunter Biden called his friends in the State Department, Joe Biden called the president, the Ukraine, Persico , three times in10 days. Went to the Ukraine in March. The investigation began February the 4th. The prosecutor was fired.

I want to know the transcripts of the phone call between the Vice President and the President of the Ukraine. I want to know what Hunter Biden was doing talking to the State Department. His business partners and blue strategies also contacted at the State Department. The question is, did Hunter Biden use his political influence to stop the investigation of a gas company he was sitting on a as a board member? The president of Burisma was Zlochevsky, the former environmental minister in the Yanukovich administration, who was identified by the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine in 2015 as being one of the most corrupt people in the Ukraine.

The question is, did one of the most corrupt people in the Ukraine hired Joe -- Hunter Biden to be a board member on a gas company and Hunter Biden knows nothing about the gas business, as an insurance policy to protect his company in situations like this. I don't know what happened. I do know this. We're not going to allow the House to investigate Trump endlessly and not ask questions about all corruption in the Ukraine. Was there a corrupt motive behind Hunter Biden's interference contacting of the State Department after the gas company was being investigated?

Nothing to do with friendship. When Joe Biden was the vice presidential nominee in 2008, he tore the bark off John McCain and Sarah Palin, nobody asked him, hey, will that hurt your friendship. It hurt my relationship because that's the job he was assigned. My job is to make sure that people I represent in South Carolina, that their voice is heard. Nobody in the media really gives a damn that Hunter Biden was sitting on this board receiving $50,000 a month. Nobody in the media really gives a damn that Hunter Biden weighed in with the State Department after the company came under investigation. They tell me political fat looked at this. What a joke.

There has been no investigation regarding the role of the Vice President, Hunter Biden and getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired after the investigation of Permisa -- Burisma, whatever the name of the company is. I'm going to make sure that those questions are asked. And finally, why am I doing this? When House Republicans tried to ask these questions about the role of Hunter Biden in the investigation of the gas company, they were shut down. So, I'm going to ask. If it were up me, we would have ended this a long time ago on both sides.

Brian Kilmeade: Senator, well said. You have some legitimate questions and you put your job over your friendship. So, he says that you're being held hostage basically by Donald Trump, that if you go against Trump, you're not going to get reelected. What's your response to that?

Lindsey Graham: It's not going to work. It's not going to work with me. I supported legislation which Chris Coons to make sure that Mueller could not be fired without cause. I didn't think the President was going to fire Mueller, but he said some things that bothered me. I didn't know what the Trump campaign did regarding Russia. I supported the idea that Mueller would be a fair guy to look. I trusted Mueller. He spent two years and $25 million. He found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. And he made no recommendations for prosecution based on obstruction of justice allegations. I thought that would end it.

What Schiff is doing is dangerous to the Presidency. He's not allowing Republicans to call witnesses. The President's counsel can't participate in the Intel Committee hearings. You can't ask any questions about whether or not Hunter Biden interfered in an investigation at the gas company where he received $50,000 a month as a board member. I want to know what Joe Biden asked of the Ukrainian government after the raid on Burisma. I hope there's nothing there. Reveal the transcripts. Trump released the transcripts. All I'm asking is that somebody look at this line of inquiry. It does look very suspicious to me. The conflict of interest is obvious with Hunter Biden being on that board. So Checci was named the most corrupt person in the Ukraine by the U.S. ambassador in 2015. They hired Hunter Biden by 2014. Burmese -- Burisma did. Was that an insurance policy to protect them against investigations? I don't know. Blue Strategies weighed in with the State Department after the raid on the gas company. Who did they talk to and what did they ask? Hunter Biden's business partner met directly with John Kerry. What was that all about? I don't believe political factors is the end of the inquiry. Somebody needs to look at this. The House is not allowing these questions to be asked. I will make sure they're asking the Senate.

Brian Kilmeade: Well, we know this. He knows nothing about what he was doing over there, but he was golfing with Archer, his partner over there in the Hamptons.

Lindsey Graham: When did he know it? What did he do? And he's a friend. I mean, you know, it's up to him if he wants the friendship to continue. I hope it will continue. But don't expect me -- you know, Chris Coons, I work with a lot. You know, I work with you to protect Mueller. You're going to rally around Joe Biden's campaign. I understand that politically. But I can promise you that when Joe Biden was doing his job as the Democratic nominee for vice president, going after McCain and Palin. Nobody ask him about is the friendship in question. So it is obvious to me that Hunter Biden did some things that need to be looked at to stop the investigation of a company. He was receiving $50,000 a month from in the Ukraine. And the president that company was one of the most corrupt people in the entire country, according to the U.S. government.

Brian Kilmeade: So Joe Biden called out Lindsey Graham said basically he feels bad for many, is angered by his action. Lindsey Graham said --

Lindsey Graham: Don't feel bad about me. Don't worry about me. I am fine, Joe. You're a good man. You lived a very consequential life. You're running for president. You're sitting on the sidelines as the Democratic Party takes a sledgehammer to Trump and his family and his life in 2014. George can't contact the Biden team to raise the conflict of interest his son had being on the board with a Burisma and they said nothing. They basically -- Joe was grieving and I understand that. But the conflict --

Brian Kilmeade: Senator, we actually pulled -- I got his chair -- two things, Chris Coons said this about you, I guess this is what you're referring to. Delaware senator took Joe Biden's spot when he went to become vice president. Senator Coons, Lindsey Graham is abandoning his friendship with Biden by doing Trump's dirty work. Do you want to respond to that specifically?

Lindsey Graham: Yeah. Chris, you're a good man. I like working with you, but we're not going to have it. We're not going to play the game like you want to play. You asked me to join with you to protect Mueller from an investigation that I thought needed to be had. Now you're shutting down legitimate questions about the role of Hunter Biden regarding a prosecution of a company he served on. You're asking us to ignore an obvious conflict of interest. It's not going to work that way.

My friendship with these people are not going to keep me from asking questions that somebody needs to ask. I represent the people of South Carolina. Every time I go out in the community, people wanting to know when we're going to look at what happened with the. Here's what the allegation basically is against the Bidens. Hunter Biden served on a board owned by the most corrupt person in the Ukraine receiving $50,000 a month. And he knows nothing about the gas business. And when the company was being investigated in the president's house was being graded, Hunter Biden started calling the State Department. Joe Biden made three phone calls in 10 days to the president of the Ukraine, went over in March to meet with the president of Ukraine and they fired the guy investigating Hunter Biden's company. We're not going to give them a pass on this. They opened up this can of worms about corruption in the Ukraine. They're alleging the president denied aid to the Ukraine cause he wanted the Bidens investigated a political opponent. There was a quid pro quo for it. I don't see that. I don't see that being proven.

Brian Kilmeade: I want you to hear Lindsey Graham talk in July 2015 with The Huffington Post about Joe Biden.

Lindsey Graham: I think in it, Meyer Joe Biden as a person. There's probably you've got a problem that you need to do some self-evaluation. Because what's not to like? I called them after Beau died and he basically said, well, Beau was my soul for a long time. He came to my ceremony. He said some of the most incredibly heartfelt things that anybody could ever say to me, and he is the nicest person that I've ever met in politics.

Male Speaker: Is that right:

Lindsey Graham: He is as good a man as God ever created. And we don't agree on much.

Brian Kilmeade: So that that's what he was contrasting risk.

Lindsey Graham: Yeah. So everything I said was about Joe Biden the first -- I've traveled the world with him. He lost his son, Beau, who I knew. I don't think I've ever talked to Hunger Biden. If I have I don't remember it. The bottom line here is I'm the senator from South Carolina. I don't remember Joe Biden being asked, why if you're such good friends with John McCain, why are you saying all these things about McCain candidacy for president? Nobody in their right mind would suggest that Joe Biden, because of his friendship with John McCain, could not make a case against John McCain being president and for Barack Obama. He did. He did it effectively. They tore the bark off John McCain.

Now, here's where I find myself. Your son is serving on a gas company in the Ukraine, making $50,000 a month. An obvious conflict of interest. That gas company gets investigated for corruption. Did your son weigh in and use his political influence to stop that investigation? President Trump wants to find out about corruption in the Ukraine. And if there's nothing there. Fine. I hope there's not. I want the transcripts of the phone calls between Biden and the president of the Ukraine. I want somebody other than political fact, look at whether or not Hunter Biden used his influence to stop the investigation of a company he receiving $50,000 a month compensation in the Ukraine based on the gas business, which you knew nothing about.

Brian Kilmeade: Senator, are you acting as the chairman of Judiciary or are you doing President Trump's dirty work or does the president intimidate you into doing what he wants you to do?

Lindsey Graham: I'm doing this because somebody needs to do it. When I supported legislation to make sure Mueller could be fired, the Trump world didn't like that much.

I was okay with what I did because I thought somebody outside of politics needs to look at the Trump campaign's interaction with Russia, if any. There was one person that could clear Trump or find him guilty of wrongdoing. To me, that was Mueller. I supported that investigation and I was the hero of the town. Standing up for the rule of law. Good old, Lindsey. Now they're playing on a friendship.

They're trying to intimidate me from asking questions that somebody should ask. Ukraine is a corrupt country. I get that. Why Hunger Biden was on his board. I don't know. If Joe Biden didn't know, I find it hard to believe. What did he know and when did you know it? Did his son, Hunter Biden use his influence with the State Department in the Obama administration to call off the dogs investigating a company that he was serving on in the Ukraine? The president this company was known to be one of the most corrupt people in the country. Why were you on his board to begin if Joe Biden's job was to clean up corrupt.

Brian Kilmeade: There's legitimate questions that nobody's asking. They always press. They preface every question with there's no corruption there. And then they go on and move on. So you're asking those questions because you're doing your job.

Lindsey Graham: My friendship with Joe Biden, if they can't withstand me doing my job is not the friendship I thought we had. Everything I said about him in 2015 is true. I admire him as a person. I think he's always trying to do right by the country. I think that -- I think he's made a lot of bad policy choices. But as a person, I like him. He spoke at Senator Thurmond's funeral. I have. I have stood up for him against allegations he was a racist. That's absurd. But we're not going to allow a system in America where only one side gets looked at. These are legitimate questions. What did Hunter Biden do in February the 4th? Brian, this is important. The prosecutor general announces an investigation of Burisma, the gas company. And that's when Hunter Biden started contacting the State Department. And after that contact, Joe Biden made three phone calls in 10 days about the prosecutor. Now, I want to know what they were talking about.

Brian Kilmeade: That's it. Senator, you had to sit there for two days and take personal attacks from Joe Biden and all his supporters and you just sounded off. And I think you --

Lindsey Graham: I'm disappointed in him. He wants to play the game where I work with him to make sure Trump gets investigated, but all of a sudden, when I ask questions that are just -- a lot of Republicans want to know the answer to, I think every American will know the answer to, all that and the bad guy. That's not going to work with me.

Brian Kilmeade: Senator Graham, I get it. I agree. Thanks so much for using this vehicle to get your side of the story out. Back in a moment."

On the roster: Bernie, Warren, Buttigieg, Biden knotted in N.H. - Detroit Democrat does impeachment flip-flop-flip - Audible: How it’s done - The car that caught the dog



BERNIE, WARREN, BUTTIGIEG, BIDEN KNOTTED IN N.H.

Boston Globe: “A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters shows a tight, four-way contest, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on top but statistically tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former vice president Joe Biden. It has been decades since this many candidates have jostled for the lead so soon before a New Hampshire presidential primary. On Monday, longtime New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner officially scheduled the vote for Feb. 11. The survey found Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, leading the field with 16 percent, including those who lean toward the candidate. Warren had 14 percent, Buttigieg had 13 percent, and Biden had 12 percent. All other candidates, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who jumped in the race this month, were in single digits. The poll suggested little about this race is set in stone.”



Senior Biden staffer, Latina adviser quits campaign - Politico: “A senior Joe Biden campaign staffer in charge of outreach to Latino, African-American and women’s groups has quit her post, telling two allies she was frustrated over her lack of input and with the presidential candidate’s immigration rhetoric. Vanessa Cárdenas, the most senior Latina Biden staffer, had been serving as national coalitions director since the campaign formally announced its existence April 25. She resigned last week and has since changed her bio on Twitter to say she was ‘formerly with @joebiden.’ Cárdenas did not return a call or text message, but two friends familiar with her thinking told POLITICO that she felt the campaign wasn’t heeding her advice on immigration as she tried to reach out to Latino groups that have had longstanding concerns with the former vice president’s rhetoric and record stemming from the Obama administration.”



Bloomy’s low-key, high-dollar launch - NYT: “Michael R. Bloomberg started his campaign at a hushed diner in downtown Norfolk, Va. … before strolling to a nearby hotel ballroom and making an efficient statement before a bank of television cameras. Accompanied by a small platoon of aides, including two of his former deputy mayors from New York City and a security team that flitted around a downtown waterfront nearly barren of pedestrians, Mr. Bloomberg described himself as a political pragmatist skilled at wielding his wealth to win elections. … If Mr. Bloomberg’s first in-person appearance as a presidential candidate lacked something in organic political energy, he has already jolted the race through the sheer scale of his political spending, stunning the Democratic political establishment and stirring an outcry from the party’s populist wing.”



Deval Patrick has a long way to go - Politico: “To call Deval Patrick’s campaign a shoestring operation would be insulting to shoestrings. Attend a Patrick event and there’s not a bumper sticker or pin to be found, let alone organizers with clipboards collecting names of would-be voters. His ground game looks to be nonexistent: The entire campaign appears to consist of a handful of volunteers and one publicly announced staffer, campaign manager Abe Rakov. In comparison, other campaigns have several hundred paid staffers and dozens of offices combined — and that’s just in New Hampshire. Patrick has spent the first dozen days of his campaign trying to persuade senior Democratic leaders in the early voting states to take him seriously. They want to give the former Massachusetts governor with an inspirational life story and friendship with Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt. But Patrick has a way to go before they fully buy in.”



Ryan Lizza: Waiting for Obama - Politico: “The post-presidency of Obama is unlike any other. Many presidents have had to navigate the tricky politics of leaving office when a president from the other party takes over. And plenty of presidents have had to grapple with the delicate situation of their vice president seeking a promotion. But Obama has to grapple with both situations simultaneously, and under unprecedented conditions: Obama is under near daily personal assault from the president, who has tweeted about him relentlessly in the past three years, often accusing him and his top officials of an array of crimes, a situation that no ex-president has faced or even imagined.”



THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS

“THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 82



TIME OUT: PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE

Smithsonian: “In the spring of 1900, twenty-four years after Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone, a Danish inventor named Valdemar Poulsen unveiled the ‘telegraphone’ at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was an engineering marvel—Poulsen recorded sound on a wire using nothing but a magnet, similar to the principle that underlies computer hard drives—and it was a minor social miracle, an antidote to Bell’s constantly ringing telephone. The telegraphone was the world’s first answering machine. … Not everyone was overjoyed. AT&T, which held a monopoly on the U.S. phone system and forbid the use of third-party technology, suppressed the innovation for more than half a century, according to research by Mark Clark, a historian of technology. … A big concern was that the device would be used not just to answer calls but to record conversations. The American Telegraphone Company, which had attempted unsuccessfully to market the machine, claimed that AT&T feared the device’s ability to record calls.”

DETROIT DEMOCRAT DOES IMPEACHMENT FLIP-FLOP-FLIP

Detroit Metro Times: “Rep. Brenda Lawrence [D-Mich.] is walking back statements she made about impeaching President Trump in an interview with Charlie LeDuff. In a written statement to Metro Times, Lawrence said she still supports impeaching Trump but censure may be a more viable option because of Republicans’ opposition to impeachment. ‘I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,’ Lawrence says. ‘The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.’”

“Chris Wallace is a damn good reporter. He asked me a very direct question. He asked me about hacking the DNC computer. I heard him say I thought he'd said meddling in the election. Chris was right.

John Kennedy, R-La., on “America’s Newsroom” taking a do-over for statements he made on “Fox News Sunday.”



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Upon hearing yet another of Joe Biden’s continuing verbal gaffes, I’m reminded that when Gov. Rick Perry had ONE instance of ‘brain fade’ during a presidential debate, it did great damage to his campaign and his viability as a candidate. But when we hear Biden’s frequent brain fades, during debates and everywhere else, Democrats and the MSM shrug and say, ‘Oh that’s just good ol’ Uncle Joe.’ Doesn’t seem like a level playing field to me – what was levied against the goose ought to be levied against the gander. Short-term memory loss is often a fact of life as we age – OK, fine! But should someone who continuously exhibits those symptoms be in the most powerful position on the planet? Should that person be the commander-in-chief?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: I thiiiiink you may be shading the past in a favorable light for the former secretary of energy. Perry burst into the 2012 primary race as a frontrunner. When he declared in August of 2011 he was already running even with Mitt Romney. By mid-September, Perry was way out in front with a double-digit lead on his fellow former governor. But then the cracks started to show. Aside from some spectacularly bad political moves – dissing Iowa, feuding with the Bush family, etc. – Perry was a simply awful debater. One performance in September in which Perry tried to attack Romney for inconstancy turned into such a debacle that commentators openly wondered about his health. In October, Perry seemed to rally for a bit, but his steep descent had already begun. By the time of the “brain fade” you reference in November, Perry was tied for fifth and headed for the exits. When he couldn’t remember the third federal agency he had called to shutter – ironically, the one he would eventually lead – it was bad enough. But that he stood there vapor locking so long and then eventually said, Heaven help us, “Oops,” it wasn’t instant disqualification. It was the coda to a long symphony of Perry’s ill-conceived, poorly executed presidential campaign. (He would later reveal that the after effects of intense back surgery the summer before his entry had been worse than he had admitted.) Biden takes a lot of abuse for his rambling, discursive answers and the anxiety-inducing inability to land answers. But that’s been his thing for 40 years. Biden was a notorious blarney and bluster merchant when he first ran in 1988. So I don’t know how much of it is media bias or, as Perry did in his subsequent 2012 candidacy and federal service, what another former Texas governor might call “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”]



“I am puzzled by the whole quid pro quo/bribery charge against Trump for calling for an investigation of Biden. If the investigation showed that there was no wrongdoing, wouldn’t that benefit Biden and be detrimental to Trump? So, those who believe the President urging Zelensky to investigate Biden was bribery (i.e., a benefit to Trump for a granted favor) must assume the investigation would find that Biden is guilty of wrongdoing.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas



[Ed. note: Why would you ever, ever, ever want a sitting president to directly involve himself in a criminal or corruption matter involving his leading political rival? Instead, one would want the sitting president to keep himself as far removed from the process on that matter more than any except for those that might involve himself or those close to him. Members of the House may get the chance to decide whether what Trump did merits removal and they can debate the names they want to use for specific conduct. But that isn’t about whether Biden did or didn’t do the things Trump claims. The conduct at issue in Congress is about Trump involving himself personally and through his personal attorney in the process. Maybe think of it this way: police or judicial misconduct isn’t dependent on whether the suspect is guilty or not. The two issues are separable.]

THE CAR THAT CAUGHT THE DOG

WPTV: “What dog doesn’t love a car ride? Better yet- a ride behind the wheel? Some Port St. Lucie neighbors watched a dog get the ride of a lifetime. It was stuck inside a car spinning in reverse for nearly an hour. Neighbors say the dog did not seem to mind at all. ‘I figured ‘how the heck did they manage to do that?’’ said neighbor Anna Sabol. Sabol said she looked out her window Thursday morning and a police car grabbed her attention. … She realized they were all responding to a grey sedan spinning in reverse in a cul-de-sac. The one occupant inside was a Black Labrador. … Police say the dog’s owner had briefly stepped out of the car when the dog somehow knocked the car into reverse. Police say they were able to stop the joyride by punching the passcode into the driver’s side door. But, not before the dog took out a mailbox, a trash can, and moved some bricks in front of a home. … Police say the dog was not hurt. No neighbors were hurt. … Instead, they say the dog seemed pretty happy about his first, and likely last, solo drive.”

“The sun rises regularly, too, but so often that we can't help being dulled to the wonder of its rhythm. And what rhythms, beyond that of the familiar year, really touch us?” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Dec. 13, 1985.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. told Fox News Radio, Monday.

""I do like Joe Biden... I think he's a very decent fella. He's had a lot of tragedy in his life,"" Graham said on ""The Brian Kilmeade Show."" ""But I'm not going to create a country where only Republicans get investigated. There's a lot of corruption in the Ukraine. They're an important ally. I thought [Robert] Mueller would end this, but Adam Schiff has created a process in the House that's un-American, dangerous to the presidency, and we're going to ask questions of Hunter Biden's role in getting the prosecutor fired.

""He served on a company, Burisma, as a board member. He received $50,000 a month, for what -- I don't know,"" he continued. ""After the investigation of the company was opened by the prosecutor general's office in the Ukraine -- Hunter Biden called his friends in the State Department. Joe Biden called the president of the Ukraine... three times in ten days.""

Graham said lawmakers need to start digging to find out if Hunter Biden exerted his political influence to benefit him legally and financially.

""The prosecutor was fired. I want to know the transcripts of the phone call between the vice president and the president of Ukraine,"" he said. ""I want to know what Hunter Biden was doing talking to the State Department.""

""The question is, did Hunter Biden use his political influence to stop an investigation of a gas company he was sitting on as a board member?"" Graham added.

He also claimed the issue would have already been put to rest if congressional Democrats halted their persecution of the Trump administration.

""We're not going to allow the House to investigate Trump endlessly and not ask questions about all corruption in the Ukraine,"" Graham said. ""Was there a corrupt motive behind Hutner Biden's interference, contacting the State Department after the gas company was being investigated. [It has] nothing to do with friendship... My job is to make sure the people I represent... that their voice is heard. Nobody in the media really gives a damn that Hunter Biden was sitting on this board.""

""What a joke. There has been no investigation,"" he added. ""If it were up to me, we would have ended this a long time ago on both sides."""

In an interview on ""Fox and Friends"" last week, Trump predicted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., would not see the impeachment process through to a vote.

""No, I don’t expect it,"" he said at the conclusion of two weeks of impeachment hearings, ""I think it’s very hard for them to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing.""

The Hill reported on Saturday that a House Democratic leadership aide called it “fantasy land” to think that there wouldn't be a vote on the House floor.

Democratic strategist Doug Schoen suggested that he hopes that the president is right.

""I am praying for censure. It can turn what could be a loss into a certain victory,"" he said, arguing that Pelosi should forgo impeachment and instead vote to publicly reprimand the president.

""While the Democratic electorate is almost unanimously in favor of impeachment, swing voters in swing states... are decidedly mixed, if not negative,"" the polling expert explained on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive.""

""And given that states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Florida -- ones the Democrats have to win in some combination to win the presidential election, it's hard for me to see that impeachment is anything but a very problematic issue for the party,"" he argued.

Paradoxically, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, who has been harshly critical of the Democrats' impeachment effort, said that he hopes that the House votes and moves the process to the Senate.

""I'm praying for a trial because it will boomerang terribly on the Democrats and only ensure the president's reelection come November,"" said Jarrett.

""Let's start exposing some of these malignant actions by people, not just [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff, and the whistleblower, but others involved in this as well,"" Jarrett contended. ""This is the witch hunt, the sequel. And it's ten times as preposterous as the original Trump/Russian collusion hoax.""

COULD PELOSI ABANDON IMPEACHMENT EFFORTS?: LEGAL ANALYST PREDICTS SHE MAY

Jarrett argued that if the Senate were to take up a trial of the president, Republicans would be in a position to raise questions over former Vice President Joe Biden's involvement in Ukraine policy, as well as his son Hunter's work with a notoriously corrupt Ukrainian company.

'There's an old saying -- the recoil is more dangerous than the projectile. And the recoil here is Hunter Biden and Joe Biden,"" continued Jarrett. ""I think the more we find out about the machinations of Hunter Biden, who appears increasingly like a prodigious grifter, this is only going to damage his father in his quest to become the next president of United States. I mean, Lindsey Graham is vowing an investigation of the activities of Hunter Biden and by implication, Joe Biden's actions in a quid pro quo.""

Schoen agreed with Jarrett that Joe and Hunter Biden's behavior appeared to have been wildly inappropriate.

""The idea that Burisma, Hunter Biden and Joe Biden didn't know what was going on is ridiculous,"" said Schoen. ""To me, Joe Biden turned the other cheek, turned the other eye, put a bag over his head, whatever. Why did he do that? He had a troubled son who landed a big, lucrative gig, and he was hoping against hope that he could skate through. Well, we're seeing now that that's not the case. I don't know that there was anything that was done that was illegal. It sure smells and it smells really bad.""

Schoen concluded that his party may regret devoting so much time and energy to the impeachment process.

""I also think that we Democrats are losing a huge opportunity because on issues like gun violence prevention, climate change, health care, we have an advantage. We won the midterm elections in 2018 because of the utilization and in part of those issues. And to not take advantage of what people care about, which is real-world day to day problems of our quality of life, and instead, just keep focusing on impeachment. If I were recommending to the Democrats what to do. I'd say vote for censure, get it and move on.""

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new report that sheds light on Obama's personal views of the jam-packed primary field with no clear front-runner.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines to date, refraining from any endorsements though he has issued general warnings to the party to avoid calls for radical upheaval in their policy pitches. These warnings were seen as a swipe at candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sanders.

But a new Politico Magazine report gives a clearer picture of what Obama is worried about -- claiming he has said in private he'd speak out against Sanders if it looked like he could actually win.

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

""Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him,"" the report says. An Obama spokesperson, however, reportedly noted that the former president has stated that he would get behind the Democratic nominee regardless of who it is.

One adviser said that while they personally had no knowledge of this, the threat of a Sanders nomination would likely be cause for action.

""I can't really confirm that,"" the adviser said, regarding the possibility of Obama trying to stop Sanders. ""He hasn't said that directly to me. The only reason I'm hesitating at all is because, yeah, if Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don't think that's likely. It's not happening.""

This aversion to Sanders would be in line with Obama's recent comments. At an Obama Foundation Summit event in October, Obama took aim at political ""wokeness"" and cancel culture.

""This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said.

Weeks later, at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, Obama warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls that most voters do not want to “tear down the system.”

Obama dismissed far-left positions as not being popular among average Americans, even if they make waves on social media.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The same Politico report, meanwhile, addressed Obama's relationship with Biden, whom he has not yet endorsed, despite Biden serving as vice president in his administration -- and routinely touting their relationship on the stump.

The Politico piece said Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Biden says he never sought Obama's endorsement.

Since 2016, President Trump has focused on his promises in an almost demented fashion. Get the economy moving; bring back jobs; renegotiate trade deals; stand up to China; appoint conservative judges; end foreign wars, build the wall; put America first.

This is why he gets into trouble. He wants to get things done and can’t stand all these stupid rules and judges, and professional politicians in Congress blocking progress.

Democrats got elected in 2018 and promised to lower health care costs, clean up Washington, rebuild our infrastructure. They’ve behaved in a demented fashion, too, not about delivering their promises, but breaking them. They've put every single ounce of energy and political capital into getting rid of President Trump.

The Democrats’ abandonment of their promises, their voters, and their responsibility to help solve people’s real-life problems is a stain on their party and frankly, all of politics. What’s going on in Washington is why real people hate Washington.

But, we promised we’d bring you the truth about impeachment every Sunday for as long as this farce goes on. And we did, in fact, learn three important things last week.

What kind of Alice in Wonderland world are we in where actual corruption is not just ignored but defended, and investigating corruption is grounds for impeachment?

One: Despite the anti-Trump cult that is ruling-class state TV screaming about yet another devastating ""bombshell,"" we actually learned that the whole aid-for-investigations allegation at the heart of the Democrats’ case was cooked up by the officials running Ukraine policy, not President Trump. Here’s Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker.

Kurt Volker: This is an effort we are doing, that this could be helpful in getting a reset of the thinking of the president, the negative view of Ukraine that he had. And if we did that, I thought that would also be helpful in unblocking whatever hold there was on security assistance, that if there’s this negative presumption about Ukraine. Getting this stuff on track would be helpful.

And this was confirmed by Mr. Bombshell himself, E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland.

Stephen Castor, GOP lawyer: You testified that Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president, correct?

Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to European Union: That’s our understanding, yes.

Castor: Okay, but how did you know that? Who told you?

Gordon Sondland: Well, when the president says, “Talk to my personal attorney,” and then Mr. Giuliani, as his personal attorney, makes certain requests or demands, we assume it’s coming from the president. I don’t -- I’m not testifying that I heard the president tell Mr. Giuliani to tell us. So, if that’s your question…

Castor: Right, but --

Sondland: Our conclusion and the conclusion of the three of us was that if we did not talk to Rudy, nothing would move forward on Ukraine.

President Trump had a negative view of Ukraine. The officials wanted to change his mind and thought the best way to do that was to get the Ukrainians to promise investigations. That’s it. That’s what this whole thing comes down to. They’re trying to overturn an election because of some bureaucrat’s tactics for handling the president, not because of anything the president himself actually did.

Two: We learned last week that when these bureaucrats say they’re “non-partisan,” that’s not true.

They may not see themselves as Republican or Democrat, but they’re partisans in the fight between the establishment and anyone who challenges its power -- between the insiders and the outsiders, the defining fight of our age.

National security staffer Alex Vindman called himself “never partisan."" But he said that while Trump asking for an investigation is “improper,” he was totally uninterested in the obvious hiding in plain sight corruption of Hunter Biden being on the board of a Ukraine energy company while his dad was in charge of Ukraine policy and channeling billions of dollars of U.S. aid to Ukraine, some of it to the Ukraine energy sector.

And that leads us nicely to the third thing we learned last week, courtesy of the pompous, sanctimonious time-waster-in-chief himself, “Shifty” Schiff. Ever since this thing started, I’ve been on the warpath against the Democrats and ruling class state TV for the way they endlessly describe Trump's alleged wrongdoing as ""investigations into his political rivals.""

But Joe Biden is not just a political rival. He is a former vice president facing credible allegations of corruption while he ran Ukraine policy. Now, he wants to be president. Yes, that’s what makes him a political rival. But it doesn’t make him above the law.

And it was Shifty Schiff himself, of all people, who inadvertently explained why Joe Biden should be investigated.

Schiff: And would you have thought it was appropriate if President Trump had asked Zelensky to investigate John Kasich, or to investigate Nancy Pelosi, or to investigate Ambassador Volker? Would that be appropriate?

Schiff just made my point. John Kasich may be a political rival of Donald Trump, but he wasn’t vice president in charge of Ukraine policy. Asking Ukraine to investigate John Kasich really would be out of order.

And here’s our breaking news, proving exactly why we need to ask Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. As we’ve shown you week after week, the real scandal here is cash-for-gas. The big question is how much U.S. taxpayer aid went to a Biden family business in Ukraine while Joe Biden was in charge of that aid.

We know that Joe Biden pushed for Ukraine to boost its gas industry. We know that soon after, his son joined Ukraine’s biggest natural gas company. We know that during Joe Biden’s time running Ukraine policy, at least $4.28 billion went to Ukraine in cash and loan guarantees. We know that some of that money was earmarked for Ukraine’s energy sector. And we also know that Joe Biden boasted about controlling that aid.

Joe Biden, former U.S. vice president: I look at them and said, “We leave in six hours. If the prosecutor’s not fired, you’re not getting the money.” Well, son of a [beep] ... he got fired.

What we don’t know is how much went to Burisma, the company paying Biden's son hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, we tried to find out. We put in a Freedom of Information request and this week, we got an answer: Our government doesn’t have this information. That’s why we need to ask the Ukrainian government.

Did you see this exchange last week?

Maloney: Who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens?

Sondland: I assume President Trump would benefit.

Maloney: There we have it. See?

What a self-regarding, grandstanding oaf.

I’ll tell you who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens -- taxpayers who want to know if their money ended up in the pockets of a corrupt oligarch because he put Joe Biden’s son on his board. Voters who want to know if the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination sells his public office for private family gain. That’s who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens and that’s why this impeachment is a farce.

What kind of Alice in Wonderland world are we in where actual corruption is not just ignored but defended, and investigating corruption is grounds for impeachment?

It’s the crazed, partisan world of Planet Pelosi, where the people are so consumed by hate and intolerance that they’ll undermine democratic norms, subvert the rule of law, destroy faith in our institutions, and divide the country just to take out their political rival because they think he’ll be reelected in 2020.

BLOOMBERG UNION FIRES BACK ON BAN TO AVOID INVESTIGATING 2020 DEMS: 'SILENCING JOURNALISTS'

A video released on Sunday by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg marked the official start of the politician/media mogul's 2020 presidential run, Fox News reported.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but then he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Varney said he finds it ironic that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have ""built their campaigns around getting rid of billionaires,"" are now running against ""Bloomberg's mountain of money.""

""Money really talks in politics,"" Varney added.

Warren and Sanders shouldn't be the only ones opposed to a Bloomberg run, however, the Fox Nation host observed -- warning Joe Biden of his new competition.

""Joe Biden can't be happy. Joe occupies the center. But his campaign is lackluster and he's not raising much money. Overnight, Bloomberg has taken over the middle ground.,"" Varney explained.

Varney credited Bloomberg for his deliberately late strategy, but his run ""throws the party into even more chaos,"" he said.

BLOOMBERG CAMPAIGN MANAGER ON 2020: TRUMP IS WINNING

""His strategy is unusual, but very smart. He'll enter the race deliberately late. He'll let his competitors tear each other apart and spend their money and then jump into Super Tuesday in March. California and 14 other states hold primary votes that day. Bloomberg's billions will have an enormous impact,"" Varney said.

""And consider this,"" he added, ""there may be an impeachment trial in the Senate right around that time, March of next year. Senators Warren Sanders, Klobuchar, Booker, Harris. They're not going to be on the campaign trail -- they'll have to be in D.C. passing judgment on the president.""

Bloomberg's run further divides the Democratic Party, Varney explained, and he believes it ""opens the door to a Trump win in 2020.""

BLOOMBERG LAUNCHING 'MASSIVE' COAST TO COAST TV AD BUY

""It's hard to believe that Democrats welcome this,"" Varney said.""I can't see the supporters of Warren and Sanders suddenly jumping ship for the $50 billion man. I can't see rural moderates getting behind a candidate who has no time for guns. And I can't see Southerners or Midwesterners supporting a climate warrior.""

""Bloomberg not only splits the party, he throws it into even more chaos. And that means no matter who leads the Democrats next year, the party remains at war with itself.""

BLOOMY THROWS WARREN A LIFELINE

After a brutal six-week stretch, there’s finally some good news for the flagging fortunes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.



In early October, the political press prematurely ordained the Massachusetts Democrat as her party’s front-runner. But Warren had landed splay-footed. She was nowhere near ready to deal with the scrutiny after months of fawning coverage and deference from her rivals. It’s been brutal.



The proximate cause of Warren’s woes was said to have been her triple-dip goofs on health insurance: No plan, a politically preposterous plan and then a rapid walk-back under pressure.



Adding to her woes have been problems with her biographical claims, including a dispute over whether she really was fired for being pregnant as a young woman and now over her denial that her children attended private school.



That all left Warren stuck between emboldened rivals to her right, particularly front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and a surging South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and her longtime frenemy to her left, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.



Underpinning all of Warren’s problems is an understanding among many Democrats that she represents a special risk to her party as a potential nominee. Her out-of-the-mainstream ideology combined with a demeanor so dour that she makes Hillary Clinton seem cheerful is a potent combination for Republican message makers.



As House Democrats prepare for a brutal fight to retain the moderate, suburban swing districts that delivered them the lower chamber in 2018 and as party strategists survey the swing-state map, they have to see Warren as a worst-case scenario right now.



That understanding helps explain how Biden keeps his national lead and how Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in her previous strongholds of Iowa and New Hampshire.



But the same pundit-politico Democratic intelligentsia that has of late suddenly realized Warren’s massive defects still maintains its dislike of Biden. Biden, 77, is said to be too old, too gaffe prone and too much of an insider to be a good nominee. In the crucial “Morning Joe” and snarky Twitter primary, Biden is still mostly a punchline. As his puny fundraising shows, Democratic elites are still down on Sheriff Joe. And an establishmentarian front-runner without the backing of said establishment is as out of place as Corn Pop on a Wilmington city pool high dive.



Riding into the fray amid a cannonade of cash is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, with $30 million Friday, has already set a new record for single-day campaign spending.



But other than the owners of local television stations and the realtors selling vacation homes to his consultants, who stands to benefit from Bloomberg’s big buy in?



Why Warren, of course.



This isn’t complicated, folks. Just as Biden has benefited from the competition between Warren and Sanders — two hard-left, New England senators in their seventies — Warren will be aided by the rivalry between two moderate, Mid-Atlantic 77-year-olds.



It’s still unknowable what Bloomberg’s money can buy him. His forerunner, billionaire investor Tom Steyer, has been a fizzle in a tartan tie. But Bloomberg is a more formidable candidate, and not just for his service as mayor of America’s largest city.



As a media mogul and survivor of the same tabloid press that produced Donald Trump, Bloomberg has more moxie. Plus, he has more than one necktie.



How big will Bloomberg open? Will he draw from Biden more than Buttigieg? Will he be able to elbow onto the December debate stage? Can he connect with the black voters who have succored Biden?



That all remains to be seen. But we know for sure that Bloomberg is a godsend for Warren.



Aside from dividing the support for her rivals, Bloomberg, erstwhile Republican and Wall Street enthusiast, makes the perfect foil. She’s been talking for a year about not letting billionaires buy the election and Bloomberg rides into the arena blasting millions into the stands like free t-shirts out of a slingshot.



Democrats may ultimately choose to ignore Bloomberg’s bid, but for as long as he is a fascination, he’s helping Warren.

TIME OUT: SAME WITH AXE BODY SPRAY

NYT: “When a bird preens its feathers, it uses a little of nature’s own pomade: an oil made by glands just above the tail. This oil helps clean and protect the bird’s plumage, but also contains a delicate bouquet of scents. To other birds — potential mates or would-be rivals — these smells carry many messages, not unlike the birdsongs and fancy feathers that are more obvious to human observers. These scents may signal that a bird would be dangerous to encounter or might be ready to mate, or any number of other cues. However, new research … suggests that these odoriferous messages may not be entirely of the bird’s own making. In a study published last month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, biologists reported that microbes living peacefully on the birds’ oil glands may play an important role in making the scent molecules involved. That implies that the birds’ microbiomes may influence both the smell and the behavior it provokes in other birds.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

In Friday’s edition of I’ll Tell You What, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss the week that was on Capitol Hill, a snoozer of a debate in Atlanta and a road trip comedy with President Trump and Senator Romney. And there's trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



BLOOMBERG NEWS WILL AVOID REPORTS ON OWNER DURING CAMPAIGN

WaPo: “Bloomberg News will stop writing unsigned editorials and its reporters will avoid investigating the personal life and finances of its owner, Mike Bloomberg, as the news organization seeks to avoid conflicts of interest in covering Bloomberg’s newly announced candidacy for president. In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations. … Most notably, [Micklethwait] said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’”



Biden can’t remember veep prospects’ names - NY Post: “Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has at least four women in mind as potential running mates — but had a hard time remembering their names when an Iowa voter asked him Friday who he would choose. … Biden then ran through a list of four prominent Democrats — without using any of their names. ‘The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware,’ he began, an apparent reference to Sally Yates… ‘The leader of the, uh, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman,’ he continued — meaning Stacey Abrams… ‘The two senators from the state of New Hampshire,’ he concluded. That would be Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Abrams … is widely seen as a top veep prospect in 2020. Yates, Shaheen, and Hassan have not been cited as potential running mates before now.”



Buttigieg proposes long-term care benefits for older Americans - Fox News: “Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Monday rolled out a plan to ‘promote dignity and security in retirement’ through additional regular payments to older Americans, along with imposing a payroll tax on the wealthiest Americans to ‘protect Social Security forever.’ The South Bend, Ind., mayor said his father had been admitted to a hospital last winter for an undisclosed illness, and died this past January. He said a social worker told him the best option for long-term care would be to deplete their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid. … On Monday, his campaign announced plans to establish Long-Term Care America, a program providing people 65 and older with a benefit of $90 per day. ‘Over 11 million will receive benefits from the program throughout their lifetime,’ according to the proposal.”



Black voters: Representation doesn’t mean change - NYT: “Moderate black voters, particularly older ones whose support has helped former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintain his lead atop most primary polls, pointed to the election of President Trump, and said nominating the candidate they saw as most capable of ending his administration was a moral priority above all others. And some black voters on the left — particularly younger ones — are disappointed by some aspects of former President Barack Obama’s legacy and have embraced the idea that supporting a candidate who is willing to upend unjust systems is more important than choosing one from their own community. … The sentiment among members of the black electorate has squeezed some candidates from both sides, and is especially meaningful for Mr. [Cory] Booker and Ms. [Kamala] Harris, two black candidates looking to replicate Mr. Obama’s electoral playbook.”



Booker wins praise but no support - WaPo: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”



MULVANEY SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY WITHHOLDING UKRAINE AID

NYT: “Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, asked officials in the budget office after President Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president whether there was a legal justification for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, according to two people briefed on an internal White House review. The discussions, which took place via email in August, came after the hold on the $391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said. The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats’ impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.”



House Intel has video, audio recordings from Giuliani associate - ABC News: “The House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who reportedly played a key role in assisting him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week. ‘We have subpoenaed Mr. Parnas and Mr. [Igor] Fruman for their records. We would like them to fully comply with those subpoenas,’ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN Sunday, with a committee spokesperson adding they would not elaborate beyond the chairman's comments.”



Schiff says Dems plan to keep moving forward - WaPo: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday that his panel will press ahead with its impeachment report even though key witnesses have not testified, in the latest signal that Democrats are moving swiftly in their probe of President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’”



Vulnerable Dems worry about constituent reactions at home - Politico: “Vulnerable Democrats are watching in horror as GOP impeachment attacks deluge their districts back home. And they want a much stronger counteroffensive from their own party and its allies. Some of those Democrats raised their concerns with party leaders this week as they prepared to leave for Thanksgiving recess, fearing that voters will be bombarded by anti-impeachment ads as families gather around the TV for parades and football, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. GOP-aligned outside groups have spent roughly $8 million on TV spots this cycle in battleground districts… The vast majority of those ads specifically hammer Democrats over impeachment. Meanwhile, swing-district Democrats are receiving little reinforcement from their own party or even other liberal coalitions.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If you jump back and forth between Fox News, Politico, and CNN you would think the impeachment hearings occurred on alternate universes. Witness X is the best thing since sliced bread, say the Dems and their Media allies. Witness X is a bomb thrower and anti-American, say the Republicans. I tend to believe that nobody has a constitutional right to a federal job. If they the Deep Statists can’t follow the President’s lead, they should follow the lead or resign. How do you know which side to believe (other than reading only Half Time Report 24/7)??” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.

It all depended on where they stood. I will say that Fox News’ coverage — helmed by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum — has done a very fine job of showing you the whole elephant. But I take your point about the overall coverage. I encourage people to do a few things when it comes to navigating the political press. First, mostly try to ignore rank partisans. They’re usually boring anyway. Second, seek out good, in-depth reporting first. I start my day with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and go from there. Third, remember that nobody has a monopoly on the truth. American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.]

TACOS. IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN’T DO?

KOLD: “An Arizona man claimed a taco helped save his life after a near-miss with a stray bullet. KOLD reported that a Tucson, Arizona named Ryan Bishop man said he feels lucky to be alive after a bullet came close to causing him serious injuries and possibly death while he was driving. Bishop told KOLD that, just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, he was driving down Houghton Road when the driver's window of his vehicle shattered. … Bishop said he got a safe distance away and pulled over to call police. That's when he said he saw a bullet. … Bishop said he normally drives with his windows down and his arm on the window ledge, exactly where the bullet hit the vehicle. ‘I'm pretty sure [eating a] taco saved my life or at least stopped my arm from getting blown apart,’ he said. ‘I had the window closed because I didn’t want pieces of the taco flying around.’”

Calling the evidence against the president ""overwhelming, unchallenged and damning,"" Schiff nevertheless asserted that investigative work would continue, and left open the possibility that Democrats would hold additional hearings. But all scheduled public hearings before Schiff's panel wrapped up on a testy note last week, and no new proceedings are planned.

""As required under House Resolution 660, the Committees are now preparing a report summarizing the evidence we have found this far, which will be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee soon after Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess,"" Schiff wrote in a letter to congressional colleagues.

He noted that the report ""will catalog the instances of non-compliance with lawful subpoenas as part of our report to the Judiciary Committee, which will allow that committee to consider whether an article of impeachment based on obstruction of Congress is warranted along with an article or articles based on this underlying conduct or other presidential misconduct. Such obstruction was the basis of the third article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon.""

In a worrying omen for moderate Democrats in swing districts that could have factored into Schiff's decision, polls have shown that independents are souring on the impeachment process. Fifty percent of independents questioned in an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted Nov. 11-15 did not support impeaching and removing Trump from office, with just 42 percent backing such a move. That’s a slight dip in support compared with the previous NPR/PBS/Marist poll – conducted the first week in October – when support stood at 45 percent.

TRUMP CALLS FOR SENATE TRIAL, SEEKS WHISTLEBLOWER AND SCHIFF AS IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES

Once it receives Schiff's report, the House Judiciary Committee has the option of drafting articles of impeachment outright or holding further hearings. Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in any potential Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such proceedings.

But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

Fox News reported last week that Democrats were considering four articles of impeachment against the president: Abuse of power, bribery, contempt of Congress, and obstruction of justice.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House last Thursday, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

""Frankly, I want a trial,"" Trump declared Friday on “Fox & Friends.”

""Frankly, I want a trial."" — President Trump

Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration. ""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

Should the House approve impeachment articles and trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump’s allies are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats -- including Trump's allegations of corruption against Joe and Hunter Biden involving their Ukraine dealings.

Additionally, Republicans would likely focus on Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and defend the president's push for investigations in that area before releasing any foreign aid. Numerous media outlets, and a Ukrainian court, have confirmed that Ukrainian actors meddled in the election, despite claims by Democrats and many media personalities that the allegations amount to a ""conspiracy theory.""

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

But, Graham indicated that any Senate trial wouldn't be pleasant for at least one Democratic presidential frontrunner. On Thursday, Graham penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between Biden former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

The letter pertained to Biden's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid when he was vice president and in charge of Ukraine policy. The prosecutor was probing Burisma holdings, where Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board despite having little relevant experience.

Already, some witnesses in the impeachment probe have raised concerns about the Biden's dealings in Ukraine.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, for example, testified behind closed doors last month that he had qualms about the younger Biden's role on the board of Burisma. And former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch said she was ""aware"" of a potential issue, because Obama administration officials prepped her for questions about Hunter Biden during her confirmation process.

""I was aware of it because as I told you before in the deposition, there had been a -- in terms of the preparation for my Senate confirmation hearings for Ukraine, there was a question about that and a select answer, so I was aware of it,"" Yovanovitch said.

She added that she was told that if the matter came up, she should refer questions to other departments.

Navy secretary fired over handling, 'lack of candor' in Eddie Gallagher case; SEAL will keep Trident pin, Pentagon says

Defense Secretary Mark Esper fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer on Sunday over his handling of the case of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who posed for a photo next to an Islamic State group terrorist’s corpse in Iraq. Spencer was fired for ""lack of candor"" -- for dishonesty and undermining the military justice system, the senior U.S. official told Fox News.

The controversy swirled around whether the Navy would strip Gallagher of his Trident pin, which is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, a source told Fox News. In July, Gallagher was cleared of serious 2017 war crimes charges in Iraq, including premeditated murder, but convicted on a lesser offense of posing with the corpse of an ISIS fighter. He was demoted from chief petty officer to a 1st class petty officer following his conviction. President Trump this month restored Gallagher’s rank and ordered that the Navy halt its internal review of his actions.

Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley spoke to Trump on Friday with the intention of persuading the president to allow the Trident review board to go forward with its inquiry. Instead, Esper learned that Spencer previously and privately proposed to the White House – contrary to Spencer’s public position – to restore Gallagher’s rank and let him retire with his Trident pin, the Pentagon said. When Esper recently asked, Spencer confirmed that he'd never informed the defense secretary about his private proposal.

Spencer had asked Trump to let the Navy review board go forward, promising that the board would, in the end, allow Gallagher to keep his Trident and rank. He effectively suggested he would be willing to fix the results of the board, which is usually comprised of the defendant’s peers, a senior U.S. official told Fox News. Trump rejected the offer.

Esper ordered that Gallagher be allowed to keep his Trident pin, noting that it would be nearly impossible for him to get a fair hearing from the military in light of recent events, a senior official said. Trump late Sunday tweeted he would nominate Kenneth Braithwaite, the current U.S. ambassador to Norway and a retired Navy rear admiral, to replace Spencer. Click here for more on our top story.

Bloomberg officially enters 2020 presidential race - and his media company faces immediate ethics problems

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially launched his 2020 presidential campaign Sunday with the release of a one-minute video. However, his entry into the race has posed a dilemma for the news service that bears his name and editors at Bloomberg have already raised eyebrows with how they say they will approach their coverage.

Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait announced Sunday it will not “investigate” the candidate or any of his Democratic rivals, and Bloomberg Opinion will no longer run unsigned editorials. The entry of Bloomberg into the presidential race also raises potential conflict-of-interest questions involving his extensive business holdings, which go well beyond his news service.

Nunes doubles down on promise to sue CNN and Daily Beast over impeachment coverage

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who promised to sue CNN and the Daily Beast, told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo this week on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that the only way to hold the ""corrupt"" media accountable is to challenge them in federal court.

Nunes first threatened legal action against both news organizations Friday for their coverage of the Trump impeachment inquiry proceedings. Both outlets had published stories claiming the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee had met with Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in Vienna in 2018 to push for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Both stories cite former Rudy Guliani associate Lev Parnas, who was indicted in October for conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations, prompting Nunes to question the validity of the source.

For allies of President Trump, the timing could be perfect.

No matter how the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act review judges the actions of law enforcement with regard to Trump campaign associate surveillance, the report will give Trump the opportunity to shift focus once more to the Russia ""witch hunt"" -- and, as he has before, attempt to link that to Democrats' escalating impeachment inquiry over his dealings with Ukraine.

HOROWITZ REPORTEDLY FINDS FBI LAWYER FALSIFIED FISA DOC

“What they have coming out is historic,” Trump himself teased last week, in an interview with ""Fox & Friends.""

Previewing his rhetorical line of attack, he said: “This was spying on my campaign. ... This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency.”

As he's already telegraphing, Trump is poised to argue anew that he has been the victim of unfair investigations since he was a candidate for president -- and allies say he'll be able to hammer home those claims, at a time when he'll need to keep any wavering Republicans by his side should impeachment head to the Senate for trial.

Horowitz has been investigating alleged FISA abuses related to the Justice Department and FBI's surveillance of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign for more than a year and a half. The report, which is said to have few redactions, is expected to be made public on Dec. 9.

'This was spying on my campaign. ... This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency.' — President Trump

One House Republican source involved in impeachment proceedings told Fox News on Monday that the president is likely to seize on the findings to argue to lawmakers and the public that he has been unfairly targeted.

“It will be damning evidence that government officials really were trying to sabotage Trump, which is what he’s been saying all along, including during the impeachment debate,” the source told Fox News.

The individual added: “It’ll make it easy for Trump to portray impeachment as yet another political hit job by the Resistance meant to undermine him and oust him—which of course it is.”

Last week, multiple news reports said that Horowitz had found evidence that an FBI lawyer manipulated a key investigative document related to the FBI’s secretive surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. In its initial 2016 FISA warrant application, the FBI described Page as an “agent of a foreign power.”

Horowitz, in the course of his review, found that the FBI employee who allegedly manipulated the document falsely stated that he had “documentation to back up a claim he had made in discussions with the Justice Department about the factual basis” for the FISA warrant application, according to a report by The Washington Post. Then, the FBI employee allegedly “altered an email” to substantiate his inaccurate version of events. The employee has since been forced out of the bureau.

At the same time, the Post reported that the alleged conduct did not affect an underlying finding that the surveillance application for Page ""had a proper legal and factual basis.""

The details suggest the report could present a mixed picture -- a document members of both parties will likely mine for information favorable to their argument.

Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos -- who believes he, separately, was surveilled during the 2016 election through human sources while doing work overseas -- said the leaks surrounding the report were meant to reflect favorably upon law enforcement but warned there is likely damaging information forthcoming.

“I think these leaks were incredibly timed,” Papadopoulos said on “Fox & Friends” Monday. “I think the report is not going to be as pleasant as many think it’s going to be for the FBI. And it’s actually probably going to lead into criminal prosecutions that [prosecutor John] Durham is going to end up taking over for.”

Horowitz is expected to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 11, another event that will keep the FISA matter in the headlines. Horowitz has said that his final report would be released publicly, with few redactions, and noted that he did not anticipate a need to prepare or issue “separate classified and public versions of the report.”

Horowitz's report could even spark new congressional investigations while offering information to other federal reviews probing allegations of abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI, giving Republicans yet another chance to turn the tables on Democrats amid the impeachment probe -- something they've already sought to do by focusing on allegations against the Bidens, as opposed to the allegations Trump wrongly pressured Ukraine to investigate the same issue.

The Justice Department and the FBI obtained warrants in 2016 to monitor Page. Page told Fox News earlier this month he was ""frustrated"" he had not been interviewed in Horowitz's probe.

According to a House GOP memo released in 2018, the unverified anti-Trump dossier “formed an essential part” of the approval of the warrant. The dossier was authored and compiled by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and was created on behalf of Fusion GPS—the firm that was hired to conduct opposition research funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign through law firm Perkins Coie.

Additionally, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was unable to substantiate key claims in the dossier, including that the Trump campaign employed hackers in the United States, that there was a compromising recording of the president in a hotel room, and that ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen flew to Prague to build a conspiracy with hackers. Cohen has denied ever heading to Prague, and no public evidence has contradicted that claim.

Meanwhile, sources told Fox News last month that U.S. Attorney John Durham’s separate, ongoing probe into potential FBI and Justice Department misconduct in the run-up to the 2016 election through the spring of 2017 has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation—and that Horowitz’s report will shed light on why Durham’s probe has become a criminal inquiry.

IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, SENATE REPUBLICANS COULD TURN TABLES ON DEMS

Durham has reportedly taken up Horowitz’s findings concerning the falsified FISA document, meaning the ex-FBI lawyer who made the changes is now under criminal investigation.

The FISA report comes after a packed spree of impeachment hearings led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. He announced a report is now being prepared for the Judiciary Committee, signaling that his panel is wrapping up its work. That committee could eventually draft articles of impeachment for a floor vote; if approved, the debate would shift to the Senate.

There, Trump’s allies, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats.

Graham penned a letter last week to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between former Vice President Joe Biden and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

This pertains to questions surrounding the elder Biden’s role in pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the natural gas firm Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board. Biden denies any wrongdoing, but Republicans have pressed for details throughout the impeachment process, in a bid to show that even though Trump’s pressure campaign on Kiev triggered the impeachment inquiry, his concern was legitimate.

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Kiev. That call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. Trump challenged the accuracy of the complaint, though the transcript released by the White House did support the core allegations that he pressed for politically related investigations.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement. Trump denies any wrongdoing.

The episode is titled “Coup.” Harold Wilson is prime minister of Britain. He has just devalued the British pound and a bad economy has provoked street demonstrators to call for his removal from office.

A cabal ensues, led by Cecil King, the editor of the otherwise pro-Labour Party newspaper, the Daily Mirror. The plotters select Lord Mountbatten as the one they wish to replace Wilson.

LIZ PEEK: REGRETFUL DEMOCRATS LOCKED INTO TRUMP IMPEACHMENT — AND PAYING A PRICE FOR IT

Wilson hears about the coup attempt and calls the Queen before the plotters can get to her. She then invites Mountbatten to Buckingham Palace where she admonishes her second cousin after which the following exchange takes place:

Mountbatten: “Why would you protect a man like Wilson?”

The Queen: “I am protecting the prime minister. I am protecting the Constitution. I am protecting democracy.”

Mountbatten: “But if the man at the heart of that democracy threatens to destroy it, are we supposed to just stand by and do nothing?”

The Queen: Yes. Doing nothing is exactly what we do and bide our time and wait for the people who voted him in to vote him out again if, indeed that is what they decide to do.”

Mountbatten decides not to proceed. Whether this scene is accurate, or not (and much of the series claims fidelity to history), it makes a point Americans should take to heart. President Trump won the 2016 election in spite of many obstacles, including united media opposition, meddling by Russia and corrupt elements in Ukraine, which sought to tilt the U.S. election in favor of Hillary Clinton.

Unlike 1968 when the economy was bad in Britain, the U.S. economy now is booming and consumer confidence is high. The impeachment hearings exposed disagreements over foreign policy, foreign policy the president has a right to make. They revealed a legitimate concern by the president that U.S. aid would go down a corruption rabbit hole, something the Obama administration had also been concerned about because it refused to send lethal aid to Ukraine “fearing that it would only escalate the bloodshed and give President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a pretext for further incursions.”

It appears that Trump also wanted the new leadership in Ukraine to investigate the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter in Ukraine, and whether they had become tainted, something the American media and President Obama’s Justice Department failed to do.

If articles of impeachment are passed by the House, it could take the Senate at least until the beginning of the primary election season in February to hold a trial. The process might drag on even further should Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decide to do so, and Republicans call witnesses of their own, including the Bidens.

While impeachment is a constitutional process, democracy is a greater one. The phrase “We the people” in the Preamble was critical to the founders. It separated America from the notion that the state and its leader, whether kings, queens, or dictators, and testimony from unelected bureaucrats is supreme. It says the people possess ultimate power.

That is why it should be up to voters this close to the next election. Wait for the people who voted Trump in either to reelect him or vote him out. Impeaching him will likely alienate half the country and could damage faith in our electoral process.

NEWT GINGRICH: FIRST THANKSGIVING WASN'T LIKE WHAT YOU WERE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL – HERE'S THE TRUE STORY

Keeping our democracy has always been a challenge. Wars have been fought and more than one million Americans have died to protect our freedom. As President Kennedy said in his inaugural speech, “Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.”

Today, our county is again under assault from forces foreign and domestic. Russia continues its attack on us unabated, from propaganda campaigns to interference in our political campaigns and elections. In addition, we are sorely tested by those who serve not the idea of America but an individual who acts like a tyrannical monarch and puts the wishes of Russian President Vladimir Putin before the best interests of this country.

The confluence of this conflict was on full display during the impeachment hearings with the testimony of three witnesses. Each one is an immigrant who chose to be an American. Their words and deeds represent the best of us.

The first one was former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Her parents fled communist and Nazi regimes and settled in Canada, where Yovanovitch was born, before moving to Connecticut. A career diplomat, Yovanovitch testified that her efforts as ambassador to help Ukraine become a democracy resulted in her removal by President Trump simply because doing her job stymied his agenda.

The second example was Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. Seeking a better life, his family came to the United States from the Soviet Union when he was 3. Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, serves on the National Security Council as the director for European affairs, and he became concerned about Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.

That call, which included mention of investigating the Ukraine connections of Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, occurred while military aid for Ukraine was being held up by the Trump administration, clear evidence of a bribe, according to many. Vindman still serves on the National Security Council but testified that he is now omitted from meetings.

During their testimony, Yovanovitch and Vindman had their loyalty to America questioned. Yet their actions while serving, their decades of public service, and their testimony before Congress prove they put their country first every day.

Finally, Fiona Hill left England because her father, a coal miner, thought America would offer her opportunities England would never provide. Hill, an expert on Russia and Putin, also served on the National Security Council until she resigned, believing she could no longer fulfill her legitimate responsibilities under the Trump administration.

During their testimony, Yovanovitch and Vindman had their loyalty to America questioned by Republican members of the Intelligence Committee. Yet their actions while serving, their decades of public service, and their testimony before Congress prove they put their country first every day. The same cannot be said of their Republican interrogators.

Hill’s opening statement made clear the real threat to our country.

“Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country — and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,” Hill said. “This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.”

She continued, “The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports. It is beyond dispute…

“The Russian government’s goal is to weaken our country — to diminish America’s global role and to neutralize a perceived U.S. threat to Russian interests. President Putin and the Russian security services aim to counter U.S. foreign policy objectives in Europe, including in Ukraine, where Moscow wishes to reassert political and economic dominance.”

She also issued this ominous warning:

“Right now, Russia’s security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We are running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.”

Despite her plea, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee continued to recite Russian propaganda, doing Putin’s work for him. The next morning during an interview, Trump did the same thing. This is a clear and present danger to our country.

""A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on,” said President Kennedy.

He doggedly refused to release his weekend schedule, even if he was traveling out of town, favoring his own privacy over the public’s right to know.

Now, as of Sunday, he’s running for president. But one organization that won’t be covering him aggressively is Bloomberg News.

FORGOTTEN? WHY MSNBC’S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE MADE NO NEWS

This is a journalistic giant, churning out 5,000 stories a day, some of them market-moving. Bloomberg News has 2,700 journalists spread across 150 bureaus around the globe, along with a television network, a magazine and those extremely lucrative Wall Street terminals.

But after the 77-year-old billionaire jumped into the Democratic race, the news service’s editor-in-chief, John Micklethwait, issued an edict to his staff.

“We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation),” the memo said. And that prohibition would extend to his rivals in the party because “We cannot treat Mike’s Democratic competitors differently.”

So everyone from Biden to Bernie to Booker to Bloomberg is off-limits for investigation.

But its team “will continue to investigate the Trump administration as the government of the day.”

If you wanted to come up with a policy that would seem to favor Bloomberg and his re-adopted party—he ran for mayor as a Republican—while disadvantaging the man whose job he wants, it would be hard to beat this.

I get that it’s a messy situation, but this is a compromise that satisfies precisely no one.

If Bloomberg’s family (and presumably Joe Biden’s son) are off-limits, are Donald Trump’s kids still fair game?

Bloomberg News has always been squeamish about covering its founder. A similarly restrictive policy was in place during Mayor Bloomberg’s 12-year tenure. But now he’s running for the highest office in the land. What issue doesn’t in some way touch on the presidential campaign?

When the ex-mayor flirted with a 2016 run, Kathy Kiely resigned as Bloomberg News’ political editor because of the same policy.

“I think that when you're running a political operation as we were that you should follow every story aggressively, and I felt that we weren't able to follow this story aggressively,” Kiely told me on “Media Buzz.” “And that I thought compromised us as an organization. I certainly --- I certainly felt it compromised me as an editor.”

Megan Murphy, Bloomberg’s former Washington bureau chief, tweeted that the policy was “ridiculous” and “not journalism.” She said she threatened to resign over a similar memo during that 2016 exploration.

The Micklethwait memo also addresses Bloomberg Opinion. The two top editors, Tim O’Brien (an MSNBC contributor) and David Shipley, are taking leaves to join the Bloomberg campaign. Meanwhile, the rest of the editorial board is being suspended and the section will refuse to publish any outside op-ed on the 2020 campaign. Closed for business.

The company says it will assign a reporter to follow the Bloomberg campaign, writing about speeches, policies and polls. The initial story on the launch said the candidate is “offering his own mix of moderate policy stances and experience in business, government and philanthropy as the way to beat President Donald Trump.”

The editor-in-chief says he doesn’t want to lay down too many rules so they can adapt to changing circumstances, and will reassess the situation if Bloomberg wins the nomination.

This is a dilemma not seen since William Randolph Hearst blatantly used his newspapers to promote his 1904 presidential bid. But Bloomberg’s company dwarfs that early 20th-century enterprise.

Other media companies examine their owners, or corporate parents, with little fuss. The Washington Post reports on Jeff Bezos and Amazon. ABC sometimes has to cover Disney. CNN had to cover Time Warner and now AT&T. It’s a fact of life in the era of corporate media.

Mike Bloomberg, to his everlasting credit, took a $10-million payout from a Wall Street firm to launch an incredibly successful business news operation. Many talented journalists have worked there over the years. It’s a shame that this short-sighted move could taint its reputation for journalistic independence."

As with so many debates in Washington, it could all come down to the moderates.

A senior administration official claimed Friday, after the apparent conclusion of House Intelligence Committee hearings, that it's ""not clear the House is going to impeach.""

DEM REVERSES COURSE ON IMPEACHMENT AGAIN, NOW SUPPORTS AFTER SAYING IT HAD NO VALUE

This, despite House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., declaring the ""evidence of Trump's misconduct is already overwhelming"" -- and many Democrats playing up testimony that linked top officials to a pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and asserted an Oval Office meeting, and possibly aid, were used as leverage.

Yet as with the Russia investigation, while the hearings have been covered extensively -- featuring analysis replete with phrases such as “game over” and “the walls are closing in” -- the polling suggests the needle isn’t moving much in the court of public opinion.

Among critical independents, there are troubling signs for impeachment backers. Fifty percent of independents questioned in an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted Nov. 11-15 did not support impeaching and removing Trump from office, with just 42 percent backing such a move. That’s a slight dip in support compared with the previous NPR/PBS/Marist poll – conducted the first week in October – when support stood at 45 percent.

While that poll was conducted before last week’s high-profile testimony, it raises the possibility that the hearings in Washington are not resonating so much outside the Beltway.

Under pressure from aggressive GOP ads, it remains unclear whether vulnerable Democrats in districts Trump won would have the stomach to go through with impeachment in the end even if the party appears united against Trump now. Just two Democrats voted against the resolution establishing the inquiry last month: Reps. Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey. But voting to start the process and voting to impeach the president are different political equations.

A window into the pressure campaign to keep Democrats in line came over a 48-hour period this week when Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., changed her tune twice on impeachment.

On Sunday, Lawrence said she no longer saw any value in the process and called on Democrats to back a symbolic censure resolution instead.

""We are so close to an election,"" Lawrence said Sunday on a Michigan radio program, noting that Trump stands little chance of being convicted by the GOP-controlled Senate. ""I will tell you, sitting here knowing how divided this country is, I don't see the value of taking him out of office. But I do see the value of putting down a marker saying his behavior is not acceptable.""

While Lawrence presented a censure as a “marker,” it would also mark a climbdown for Democrats, whose impeachment push has sidelined almost every other political issue since the summer.

AS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BREAKS FOR THANKSGIVING, CONVERSATIONS OVER TURKEY COULD DICTATE NEXT STEPS

But on Tuesday Lawrence issued a new statement, saying she continues to support impeachment.

""I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,"" Lawrence said in a statement. ""The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment.""

Asked by Fox News whether Democratic leadership pushed for the latest statement, an aide said: ""Not that I know of."" But the aide suggested the congresswoman still likes the idea of a censure, saying, ""What she was trying to say is that because she doesn't think the Senate will convict, that maybe censure would be a viable option.""

The Republican National Committee promptly sent out an email blast crowing that Democrats are getting ""cold feet"" and ""vulnerable"" members ""should listen to their constituents and be the next group to abandon ship.""

Other Democrats have expressed some uncertainty without tipping their hands. Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., told The Washington Examiner that she doesn’t know if the impeachment hearings will change voters' minds.

“I’ll have to see,” she said. “Whether it will shift their minds one way or the other, I don’t know that.”

The next few weeks are key.

Lawmakers are likely to keep a close eye on how public opinion shifts or doesn’t over the Thanksgiving break. Democrats in pro-Trump districts could face difficult decisions -- and while the math is in the pro-impeachment favor, it isn’t a slam dunk.

A simple majority -- 216 of 431 members -- is needed to impeach. There are 233 Democrats, meaning that presuming anti-Trump independent Rep. Justin Amash backs impeachment, Democrats can lose 18 of their own and still impeach the president.

Thirty-one of those Democrats represent districts carried by Trump in 2016. Those members will be watched closely as the House Judiciary Committee takes up the case and considers articles of impeachment as soon as next month.

As for Republicans, it seems extremely unlikely that any will break off. Republicans such as Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, who was eyed as a possible break-off from the GOP, recently indicated he will vote against impeachment.

Democrats also face the prospect of a Republican-controlled Senate trial, in which Republicans could use the proceedings to go on offense and call their own witnesses to make their case that there was Ukrainian interference in 2016, or that former Vice President Joe Biden or his son's conduct in the country was inappropriate.

Sensing a possible opening, the Republican National Committee is ramping up the pressure on Democrats in pro-Trump districts. As reported by The Daily Caller, the RNC is running ads urging voters to pick a lawmaker who “won’t waste taxpayer $$$ on partisan impeachment.”

“[House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi herself said impeachment must be ‘compelling,’ ‘overwhelming,’ and ‘bipartisan,’"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted.

“After 2 weeks of sham hearings, the Democrats’ case against @realDonaldTrump is dead — and the only thing that’s 'bipartisan' is the opposition to their entire charade,” she said.

* The right expected way too much from the Horowitz report: “The Justice Department’s inspector general found no evidence that the F.B.I. attempted to place undercover agents or informants inside Donald J. Trump’s campaign in 2016 as agents investigated whether his associates conspired with Russia’s election interference operation, people familiar with a draft of the inspector general’s report said.”

* Dems seem to be raising a legitimate point: “As the Justice Department’s internal watchdog prepares to release a long-awaited report examining the FBI’s conduct in 2016 and 2017 in the Russia investigation, Democrats are expressing frustration over what they view as his failure to examine the conduct of Donald Trump’s attorneys general over the past two years.”

* Climate crisis: “With world leaders gathering in Madrid next week for their annual bargaining session over how to avert a climate catastrophe, the latest assessment issued by the United Nations said Tuesday that greenhouse gas emissions are still rising dangerously.”

* Remember last week, when Trump’s EPA started rolling back chemical-plant safeguards? “An explosion at a chemical plant in southeastern Texas early on Wednesday injured at least eight people, shattered the windows of nearby homes and forced residents near the site to flee as orange flames shot into the sky.”

* Perhaps we should encourage more immigration while creating a support infrastructure for families, including child care: “A final tally of babies born in the U.S. last year confirms that the birth rate fell again in 2018, reaching the lowest level in more than three decades.”

First, there was the persistent criticism of Biden's campaign from Obama's inner circle. Then, there were the lingering questions over why ""44"" has not simply endorsed his former vice president. Now come reports that Obama has made discouraging -- even derisive -- comments about his candidacy.

BIDEN CLINGS TO OBAMA LEGACY AS CANDIDACY STUMBLES -- THOUGH EX-PRESIDENT, AIDES KEEP DISTANCE

""[Y]ou know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden,"" Obama said about a connection with voters, according to a recent Politico Magazine report. That remark reportedly was made to one of Biden's Democratic primary opponents.

An August New York Times report also cited a source who claimed that before Biden officially entered the 2020 race, Obama told him, “You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t.”

That article came after Obama's former top strategist David Axelrod had harsh words for the former vice president. Axelrod warned that Biden “has sort of played into the caricature” of being mentally weak that President Trump has played on in the past. This, after Axelrod had questioned Biden's ""steadiness"" regarding an abortion policy flip-flop.

Axelrod also has described Biden as “confused” and suggested he looked like “part of the past rather than the future,” after a heated exchange during a June debate between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The dismissive commentary from one of the chief architects of Obama's history-making 2008 presidential run is not helpful for a candidate who has latched his campaign to the Obama legacy -- routinely defending ObamaCare in the face of primary rivals vowing to pursue ""Medicare-for-all,"" and reminding voters of their bond. (In the category of kidding/not kidding, Biden once posted matching friendship bracelets on Twitter wishing the former commander-in-chief a happy Best Friends Day. Obama responded with a classy, ""Back atcha Joe,"" along with a GIF of him calling Biden the ""best VP America has ever had."")

Obama may think Biden was a great VP -- but that doesn't mean he sees him as president.

Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and current Fox News contributor, pointed to signals from Obama's aides.

“The Obama team is everywhere across the field and you don’t get the sense that there’s a lot of love and enthusiasm for Joe Biden as a candidate,” Rove said Tuesday. “Maybe it’s because they don’t think he can get it across the line, maybe it’s because they don’t agree with him, or maybe it’s because they dealt with him in the Obama administration and while they have a great deal of affection for him don’t think he has what it takes to be a presidential candidate and a victor.”

Obama has yet to endorse any candidate in the race, but Biden has said that it was his decision not to seek an endorsement from the former president.

At the same time, the mixed messages from Obama World do not seem to be hurting Biden at the moment.

A new CNN poll released Wednesday has Biden leading the pack with 28 percent, well ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with 17 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with 14 percent, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 11 percent.

And a newly released Quinnipiac University poll of Democratic-leaning voters had Biden in first place with 24 percent, and way ahead of the other candidates on the question of who would have the best chance of defeating Trump."

On the roster: Bernie, Warren, Buttigieg, Biden knotted in N.H. - Detroit Democrat does impeachment flip-flop-flip - Audible: How it’s done - The car that caught the dog



BERNIE, WARREN, BUTTIGIEG, BIDEN KNOTTED IN N.H.

Boston Globe: “A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters shows a tight, four-way contest, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on top but statistically tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former vice president Joe Biden. It has been decades since this many candidates have jostled for the lead so soon before a New Hampshire presidential primary. On Monday, longtime New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner officially scheduled the vote for Feb. 11. The survey found Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, leading the field with 16 percent, including those who lean toward the candidate. Warren had 14 percent, Buttigieg had 13 percent, and Biden had 12 percent. All other candidates, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who jumped in the race this month, were in single digits. The poll suggested little about this race is set in stone.”



Senior Biden staffer, Latina adviser quits campaign - Politico: “A senior Joe Biden campaign staffer in charge of outreach to Latino, African-American and women’s groups has quit her post, telling two allies she was frustrated over her lack of input and with the presidential candidate’s immigration rhetoric. Vanessa Cárdenas, the most senior Latina Biden staffer, had been serving as national coalitions director since the campaign formally announced its existence April 25. She resigned last week and has since changed her bio on Twitter to say she was ‘formerly with @joebiden.’ Cárdenas did not return a call or text message, but two friends familiar with her thinking told POLITICO that she felt the campaign wasn’t heeding her advice on immigration as she tried to reach out to Latino groups that have had longstanding concerns with the former vice president’s rhetoric and record stemming from the Obama administration.”



Bloomy’s low-key, high-dollar launch - NYT: “Michael R. Bloomberg started his campaign at a hushed diner in downtown Norfolk, Va. … before strolling to a nearby hotel ballroom and making an efficient statement before a bank of television cameras. Accompanied by a small platoon of aides, including two of his former deputy mayors from New York City and a security team that flitted around a downtown waterfront nearly barren of pedestrians, Mr. Bloomberg described himself as a political pragmatist skilled at wielding his wealth to win elections. … If Mr. Bloomberg’s first in-person appearance as a presidential candidate lacked something in organic political energy, he has already jolted the race through the sheer scale of his political spending, stunning the Democratic political establishment and stirring an outcry from the party’s populist wing.”



Deval Patrick has a long way to go - Politico: “To call Deval Patrick’s campaign a shoestring operation would be insulting to shoestrings. Attend a Patrick event and there’s not a bumper sticker or pin to be found, let alone organizers with clipboards collecting names of would-be voters. His ground game looks to be nonexistent: The entire campaign appears to consist of a handful of volunteers and one publicly announced staffer, campaign manager Abe Rakov. In comparison, other campaigns have several hundred paid staffers and dozens of offices combined — and that’s just in New Hampshire. Patrick has spent the first dozen days of his campaign trying to persuade senior Democratic leaders in the early voting states to take him seriously. They want to give the former Massachusetts governor with an inspirational life story and friendship with Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt. But Patrick has a way to go before they fully buy in.”



Ryan Lizza: Waiting for Obama - Politico: “The post-presidency of Obama is unlike any other. Many presidents have had to navigate the tricky politics of leaving office when a president from the other party takes over. And plenty of presidents have had to grapple with the delicate situation of their vice president seeking a promotion. But Obama has to grapple with both situations simultaneously, and under unprecedented conditions: Obama is under near daily personal assault from the president, who has tweeted about him relentlessly in the past three years, often accusing him and his top officials of an array of crimes, a situation that no ex-president has faced or even imagined.”



THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS

“THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 82



TIME OUT: PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE

Smithsonian: “In the spring of 1900, twenty-four years after Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone, a Danish inventor named Valdemar Poulsen unveiled the ‘telegraphone’ at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was an engineering marvel—Poulsen recorded sound on a wire using nothing but a magnet, similar to the principle that underlies computer hard drives—and it was a minor social miracle, an antidote to Bell’s constantly ringing telephone. The telegraphone was the world’s first answering machine. … Not everyone was overjoyed. AT&T, which held a monopoly on the U.S. phone system and forbid the use of third-party technology, suppressed the innovation for more than half a century, according to research by Mark Clark, a historian of technology. … A big concern was that the device would be used not just to answer calls but to record conversations. The American Telegraphone Company, which had attempted unsuccessfully to market the machine, claimed that AT&T feared the device’s ability to record calls.”

DETROIT DEMOCRAT DOES IMPEACHMENT FLIP-FLOP-FLIP

Detroit Metro Times: “Rep. Brenda Lawrence [D-Mich.] is walking back statements she made about impeaching President Trump in an interview with Charlie LeDuff. In a written statement to Metro Times, Lawrence said she still supports impeaching Trump but censure may be a more viable option because of Republicans’ opposition to impeachment. ‘I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,’ Lawrence says. ‘The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.’”

AUDIBLE: HOW IT’S DONE

“Chris Wallace is a damn good reporter. He asked me a very direct question. He asked me about hacking the DNC computer. I heard him say I thought he'd said meddling in the election. Chris was right. I was wrong. So let me be clear. Russia hacked the DNC computer. I have no evidence whatsoever that Ukraine did it.” – Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., on “America’s Newsroom” taking a do-over for statements he made on “Fox News Sunday.”



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Upon hearing yet another of Joe Biden’s continuing verbal gaffes, I’m reminded that when Gov. Rick Perry had ONE instance of ‘brain fade’ during a presidential debate, it did great damage to his campaign and his viability as a candidate. But when we hear Biden’s frequent brain fades, during debates and everywhere else, Democrats and the MSM shrug and say, ‘Oh that’s just good ol’ Uncle Joe.’ Doesn’t seem like a level playing field to me – what was levied against the goose ought to be levied against the gander. Short-term memory loss is often a fact of life as we age – OK, fine! But should someone who continuously exhibits those symptoms be in the most powerful position on the planet? Should that person be the commander-in-chief?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: I thiiiiink you may be shading the past in a favorable light for the former secretary of energy. Perry burst into the 2012 primary race as a frontrunner. When he declared in August of 2011 he was already running even with Mitt Romney. By mid-September, Perry was way out in front with a double-digit lead on his fellow former governor. But then the cracks started to show. Aside from some spectacularly bad political moves – dissing Iowa, feuding with the Bush family, etc. – Perry was a simply awful debater. One performance in September in which Perry tried to attack Romney for inconstancy turned into such a debacle that commentators openly wondered about his health. In October, Perry seemed to rally for a bit, but his steep descent had already begun. By the time of the “brain fade” you reference in November, Perry was tied for fifth and headed for the exits. When he couldn’t remember the third federal agency he had called to shutter – ironically, the one he would eventually lead – it was bad enough. But that he stood there vapor locking so long and then eventually said, Heaven help us, “Oops,” it wasn’t instant disqualification. It was the coda to a long symphony of Perry’s ill-conceived, poorly executed presidential campaign. (He would later reveal that the after effects of intense back surgery the summer before his entry had been worse than he had admitted.) Biden takes a lot of abuse for his rambling, discursive answers and the anxiety-inducing inability to land answers. But that’s been his thing for 40 years. Biden was a notorious blarney and bluster merchant when he first ran in 1988. So I don’t know how much of it is media bias or, as Perry did in his subsequent 2012 candidacy and federal service, what another former Texas governor might call “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”]



“I am puzzled by the whole quid pro quo/bribery charge against Trump for calling for an investigation of Biden. If the investigation showed that there was no wrongdoing, wouldn’t that benefit Biden and be detrimental to Trump? So, those who believe the President urging Zelensky to investigate Biden was bribery (i.e., a benefit to Trump for a granted favor) must assume the investigation would find that Biden is guilty of wrongdoing.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas



[Ed. note: Why would you ever, ever, ever want a sitting president to directly involve himself in a criminal or corruption matter involving his leading political rival? Instead, one would want the sitting president to keep himself as far removed from the process on that matter more than any except for those that might involve himself or those close to him. Members of the House may get the chance to decide whether what Trump did merits removal and they can debate the names they want to use for specific conduct. But that isn’t about whether Biden did or didn’t do the things Trump claims. The conduct at issue in Congress is about Trump involving himself personally and through his personal attorney in the process. Maybe think of it this way: police or judicial misconduct isn’t dependent on whether the suspect is guilty or not. The two issues are separable.]

THE CAR THAT CAUGHT THE DOG

WPTV: “What dog doesn’t love a car ride? Better yet- a ride behind the wheel? Some Port St. Lucie neighbors watched a dog get the ride of a lifetime. It was stuck inside a car spinning in reverse for nearly an hour. Neighbors say the dog did not seem to mind at all. ‘I figured ‘how the heck did they manage to do that?’’ said neighbor Anna Sabol. Sabol said she looked out her window Thursday morning and a police car grabbed her attention. … She realized they were all responding to a grey sedan spinning in reverse in a cul-de-sac. The one occupant inside was a Black Labrador. … Police say the dog’s owner had briefly stepped out of the car when the dog somehow knocked the car into reverse. Police say they were able to stop the joyride by punching the passcode into the driver’s side door. But, not before the dog took out a mailbox, a trash can, and moved some bricks in front of a home. … Police say the dog was not hurt. No neighbors were hurt. … Instead, they say the dog seemed pretty happy about his first, and likely last, solo drive.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The sun rises regularly, too, but so often that we can't help being dulled to the wonder of its rhythm. And what rhythms, beyond that of the familiar year, really touch us?” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Dec. 13, 1985.

Sanders said Trump was doing so well that he could win in a ""landslide.""

""And I think if those numbers stay, hold where they are, even as a baseline, it's not just game over but it is a landslide victory for this president,"" Sanders added.

The former White House official also said Democrats are desperate to find a formidable candidate, responding to a question about former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick who also jumped into the Democrats field.

""I think they're desperately trying to find somebody who can actually run a real campaign,"" Sanders said. ""So far everything we've seen out of the Democrat field does nothing but make every Republican in this country extremely happy because it's clear that Donald Trump is going to win reelection.""

Sanders also blasted Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden, calling him a ""weak candidate.""

""Anybody who has painfully sat and watched each of these Democrat debates knows that Joe Biden is an incredibly weak candidate and he's their front runner,"" Sanders said. ""He's tied up in corruption, scandal after scandal, and he's still considered the front runner."""

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Perino was responding to a report from Politico saying Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added: “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Earlier this month, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading the field in Iowa with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Elizabeth Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

The former White House press secretary said it's ""pretty clear that Biden doesn't have what it takes in Iowa,"" adding that the Democratic Party is divided into factions.

""They can't pull the coalition together from older people to younger people to African-Americans and Hispanics, white liberals, academics, climate change people,"" Perino said. ""They have all these different factions. And that's because they have created them""

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines to date, refraining from any endorsements though he has issued general warnings to the party to avoid calls for radical upheaval in their policy pitches. These warnings were seen as a swipe at candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sanders.

But a new Politico Magazine report gives a clearer picture of what Obama is worried about -- claiming he has said in private he'd speak out against Sanders if it looked like he could actually win.

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

""Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him,"" the report says. An Obama spokesperson, however, reportedly noted that the former president has stated that he would get behind the Democratic nominee regardless of who it is.

One adviser said that while they personally had no knowledge of this, the threat of a Sanders nomination would likely be cause for action.

""I can't really confirm that,"" the adviser said, regarding the possibility of Obama trying to stop Sanders. ""He hasn't said that directly to me. The only reason I'm hesitating at all is because, yeah, if Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don't think that's likely. It's not happening.""

This aversion to Sanders would be in line with Obama's recent comments. At an Obama Foundation Summit event in October, Obama took aim at political ""wokeness"" and cancel culture.

""This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said.

Weeks later, at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, Obama warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls that most voters do not want to “tear down the system.”

Obama dismissed far-left positions as not being popular among average Americans, even if they make waves on social media.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The same Politico report, meanwhile, addressed Obama's relationship with Biden, whom he has not yet endorsed, despite Biden serving as vice president in his administration -- and routinely touting their relationship on the stump.

The Politico piece said Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Biden says he never sought Obama's endorsement.

Since 2016, President Trump has focused on his promises in an almost demented fashion. Get the economy moving; bring back jobs; renegotiate trade deals; stand up to China; appoint conservative judges; end foreign wars, build the wall; put America first.

This is why he gets into trouble. He wants to get things done and can’t stand all these stupid rules and judges, and professional politicians in Congress blocking progress.

Democrats got elected in 2018 and promised to lower health care costs, clean up Washington, rebuild our infrastructure. They’ve behaved in a demented fashion, too, not about delivering their promises, but breaking them. They've put every single ounce of energy and political capital into getting rid of President Trump.

The Democrats’ abandonment of their promises, their voters, and their responsibility to help solve people’s real-life problems is a stain on their party and frankly, all of politics. What’s going on in Washington is why real people hate Washington.

But, we promised we’d bring you the truth about impeachment every Sunday for as long as this farce goes on. And we did, in fact, learn three important things last week.

What kind of Alice in Wonderland world are we in where actual corruption is not just ignored but defended, and investigating corruption is grounds for impeachment?

One: Despite the anti-Trump cult that is ruling-class state TV screaming about yet another devastating ""bombshell,"" we actually learned that the whole aid-for-investigations allegation at the heart of the Democrats’ case was cooked up by the officials running Ukraine policy, not President Trump. Here’s Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker.

Kurt Volker: This is an effort we are doing, that this could be helpful in getting a reset of the thinking of the president, the negative view of Ukraine that he had. And if we did that, I thought that would also be helpful in unblocking whatever hold there was on security assistance, that if there’s this negative presumption about Ukraine. Getting this stuff on track would be helpful.

And this was confirmed by Mr. Bombshell himself, E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland.

Stephen Castor, GOP lawyer: You testified that Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president, correct?

Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to European Union: That’s our understanding, yes.

Castor: Okay, but how did you know that? Who told you?

Gordon Sondland: Well, when the president says, “Talk to my personal attorney,” and then Mr. Giuliani, as his personal attorney, makes certain requests or demands, we assume it’s coming from the president. I don’t -- I’m not testifying that I heard the president tell Mr. Giuliani to tell us. So, if that’s your question…

Castor: Right, but --

Sondland: Our conclusion and the conclusion of the three of us was that if we did not talk to Rudy, nothing would move forward on Ukraine.

President Trump had a negative view of Ukraine. The officials wanted to change his mind and thought the best way to do that was to get the Ukrainians to promise investigations. That’s it. That’s what this whole thing comes down to. They’re trying to overturn an election because of some bureaucrat’s tactics for handling the president, not because of anything the president himself actually did.

Two: We learned last week that when these bureaucrats say they’re “non-partisan,” that’s not true.

They may not see themselves as Republican or Democrat, but they’re partisans in the fight between the establishment and anyone who challenges its power -- between the insiders and the outsiders, the defining fight of our age.

National security staffer Alex Vindman called himself “never partisan."" But he said that while Trump asking for an investigation is “improper,” he was totally uninterested in the obvious hiding in plain sight corruption of Hunter Biden being on the board of a Ukraine energy company while his dad was in charge of Ukraine policy and channeling billions of dollars of U.S. aid to Ukraine, some of it to the Ukraine energy sector.

And that leads us nicely to the third thing we learned last week, courtesy of the pompous, sanctimonious time-waster-in-chief himself, “Shifty” Schiff. Ever since this thing started, I’ve been on the warpath against the Democrats and ruling class state TV for the way they endlessly describe Trump's alleged wrongdoing as ""investigations into his political rivals.""

But Joe Biden is not just a political rival. He is a former vice president facing credible allegations of corruption while he ran Ukraine policy. Now, he wants to be president. Yes, that’s what makes him a political rival. But it doesn’t make him above the law.

And it was Shifty Schiff himself, of all people, who inadvertently explained why Joe Biden should be investigated.

Schiff: And would you have thought it was appropriate if President Trump had asked Zelensky to investigate John Kasich, or to investigate Nancy Pelosi, or to investigate Ambassador Volker? Would that be appropriate?

Schiff just made my point. John Kasich may be a political rival of Donald Trump, but he wasn’t vice president in charge of Ukraine policy. Asking Ukraine to investigate John Kasich really would be out of order.

And here’s our breaking news, proving exactly why we need to ask Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. As we’ve shown you week after week, the real scandal here is cash-for-gas. The big question is how much U.S. taxpayer aid went to a Biden family business in Ukraine while Joe Biden was in charge of that aid.

We know that Joe Biden pushed for Ukraine to boost its gas industry. We know that soon after, his son joined Ukraine’s biggest natural gas company. We know that during Joe Biden’s time running Ukraine policy, at least $4.28 billion went to Ukraine in cash and loan guarantees. We know that some of that money was earmarked for Ukraine’s energy sector. And we also know that Joe Biden boasted about controlling that aid.

Joe Biden, former U.S. vice president: I look at them and said, “We leave in six hours. If the prosecutor’s not fired, you’re not getting the money.” Well, son of a [beep] ... he got fired.

What we don’t know is how much went to Burisma, the company paying Biden's son hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, we tried to find out. We put in a Freedom of Information request and this week, we got an answer: Our government doesn’t have this information. That’s why we need to ask the Ukrainian government.

Did you see this exchange last week?

Maloney: Who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens?

Sondland: I assume President Trump would benefit.

Maloney: There we have it. See?

What a self-regarding, grandstanding oaf.

I’ll tell you who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens -- taxpayers who want to know if their money ended up in the pockets of a corrupt oligarch because he put Joe Biden’s son on his board. Voters who want to know if the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination sells his public office for private family gain. That’s who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens and that’s why this impeachment is a farce.

What kind of Alice in Wonderland world are we in where actual corruption is not just ignored but defended, and investigating corruption is grounds for impeachment?

It’s the crazed, partisan world of Planet Pelosi, where the people are so consumed by hate and intolerance that they’ll undermine democratic norms, subvert the rule of law, destroy faith in our institutions, and divide the country just to take out their political rival because they think he’ll be reelected in 2020.

What a joke. What a disgrace.

If Bloomberg's willing to go in that heavy, I think he could become a serious candidate. But I don’t think he will.

""What he may do is he may contribute to getting to a brokered convention, although I have to say, as much as I thought [Joe] Biden would fade, he does just keep plugging away, and... you'd have to say the party is moving away from the left, moving back towards Buttigieg, who's sort of a moderate,"" he added.

The tweet, which didn't include any context, came after polling showed voters souring on impeachment and as House Democrats prepare another round of hearings in the ongoing impeachment inquiry. On Tuesday, Trump denounced Democrats' inquiry to a packed rally in Florida.

“First it was the Russia hoax,” Trump said. “And now the same maniacs are pushing the deranged ... impeachment” narrative.

For the past few months, Trump has been fending off accusations that he sought to influence the 2020 election by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

The president and Republicans have denied any wrongdoing and repeatedly portrayed Trump as the victim of a partisan attempt to overturn the 2016 election.

""It is a Democrat Scam that is going nowhere but, future Presidents should in no way be compromised. What has happened to me should never happen to another President!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday.

Trump also tweeted a clip of Fox News host Pete Hegseth reporting on the massive crowd size of Tuesday night's rally in Florida. During interviews with Hegseth, rally attendees expressed their support for the president.

""I come from a family of Democrats and I just can't take the swamp anymore,"" one attendee said. Another said that he grew up as a Democrat but became a ""staunch supporter of Trump.""

HOUSE DEMOCRATS DEFEND IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

On Twitter, Trump faced a wave of mockery for posting a photo of his face on Rocky's body. Some knocked his physical appearance, suggesting that he was nowhere near the shape that Rocky was. It also comes as Trump is dismissing rumors he had a health scare after a recent visit to Walter Reed Medical Center.

The photo also seemed to indicate Trump's mood going into the second round of impeachment hearings, led by the House Judiciary Committee.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the committee's chair, sent a letter to Trump, apparently welcoming a challenge for the first hearing, which is scheduled for Dec. 4.

For allies of President Trump, the timing could be perfect.

No matter how the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act review judges the actions of law enforcement with regard to Trump campaign associate surveillance, the report will give Trump the opportunity to shift focus once more to the Russia ""witch hunt"" -- and, as he has before, attempt to link that to Democrats' escalating impeachment inquiry over his dealings with Ukraine.

HOROWITZ REPORTEDLY FINDS FBI LAWYER FALSIFIED FISA DOC

“What they have coming out is historic,” Trump himself teased last week, in an interview with ""Fox & Friends.""

Previewing his rhetorical line of attack, he said: “This was spying on my campaign. ... This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency.”

As he's already telegraphing, Trump is poised to argue anew that he has been the victim of unfair investigations since he was a candidate for president -- and allies say he'll be able to hammer home those claims, at a time when he'll need to keep any wavering Republicans by his side should impeachment head to the Senate for trial.

Horowitz has been investigating alleged FISA abuses related to the Justice Department and FBI's surveillance of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign for more than a year and a half. The report, which is said to have few redactions, is expected to be made public on Dec. 9.

'This was spying on my campaign. ... This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency.' — President Trump

One House Republican source involved in impeachment proceedings told Fox News on Monday that the president is likely to seize on the findings to argue to lawmakers and the public that he has been unfairly targeted.

“It will be damning evidence that government officials really were trying to sabotage Trump, which is what he’s been saying all along, including during the impeachment debate,” the source told Fox News.

The individual added: “It’ll make it easy for Trump to portray impeachment as yet another political hit job by the Resistance meant to undermine him and oust him—which of course it is.”

Last week, multiple news reports said that Horowitz had found evidence that an FBI lawyer manipulated a key investigative document related to the FBI’s secretive surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. In its initial 2016 FISA warrant application, the FBI described Page as an “agent of a foreign power.”

Horowitz, in the course of his review, found that the FBI employee who allegedly manipulated the document falsely stated that he had “documentation to back up a claim he had made in discussions with the Justice Department about the factual basis” for the FISA warrant application, according to a report by The Washington Post. Then, the FBI employee allegedly “altered an email” to substantiate his inaccurate version of events. The employee has since been forced out of the bureau.

At the same time, the Post reported that the alleged conduct did not affect an underlying finding that the surveillance application for Page ""had a proper legal and factual basis.""

The details suggest the report could present a mixed picture -- a document members of both parties will likely mine for information favorable to their argument.

Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos -- who believes he, separately, was surveilled during the 2016 election through human sources while doing work overseas -- said the leaks surrounding the report were meant to reflect favorably upon law enforcement but warned there is likely damaging information forthcoming.

“I think these leaks were incredibly timed,” Papadopoulos said on “Fox & Friends” Monday. “I think the report is not going to be as pleasant as many think it’s going to be for the FBI. And it’s actually probably going to lead into criminal prosecutions that [prosecutor John] Durham is going to end up taking over for.”

Horowitz is expected to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 11, another event that will keep the FISA matter in the headlines. Horowitz has said that his final report would be released publicly, with few redactions, and noted that he did not anticipate a need to prepare or issue “separate classified and public versions of the report.”

Horowitz's report could even spark new congressional investigations while offering information to other federal reviews probing allegations of abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI, giving Republicans yet another chance to turn the tables on Democrats amid the impeachment probe -- something they've already sought to do by focusing on allegations against the Bidens, as opposed to the allegations Trump wrongly pressured Ukraine to investigate the same issue.

The Justice Department and the FBI obtained warrants in 2016 to monitor Page. Page told Fox News earlier this month he was ""frustrated"" he had not been interviewed in Horowitz's probe.

According to a House GOP memo released in 2018, the unverified anti-Trump dossier “formed an essential part” of the approval of the warrant. The dossier was authored and compiled by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and was created on behalf of Fusion GPS—the firm that was hired to conduct opposition research funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign through law firm Perkins Coie.

Additionally, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was unable to substantiate key claims in the dossier, including that the Trump campaign employed hackers in the United States, that there was a compromising recording of the president in a hotel room, and that ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen flew to Prague to build a conspiracy with hackers. Cohen has denied ever heading to Prague, and no public evidence has contradicted that claim.

Meanwhile, sources told Fox News last month that U.S. Attorney John Durham’s separate, ongoing probe into potential FBI and Justice Department misconduct in the run-up to the 2016 election through the spring of 2017 has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation—and that Horowitz’s report will shed light on why Durham’s probe has become a criminal inquiry.

IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, SENATE REPUBLICANS COULD TURN TABLES ON DEMS

Durham has reportedly taken up Horowitz’s findings concerning the falsified FISA document, meaning the ex-FBI lawyer who made the changes is now under criminal investigation.

The FISA report comes after a packed spree of impeachment hearings led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. He announced a report is now being prepared for the Judiciary Committee, signaling that his panel is wrapping up its work. That committee could eventually draft articles of impeachment for a floor vote; if approved, the debate would shift to the Senate.

There, Trump’s allies, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats.

Graham penned a letter last week to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between former Vice President Joe Biden and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

This pertains to questions surrounding the elder Biden’s role in pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the natural gas firm Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board. Biden denies any wrongdoing, but Republicans have pressed for details throughout the impeachment process, in a bid to show that even though Trump’s pressure campaign on Kiev triggered the impeachment inquiry, his concern was legitimate.

At the center of the impeachment inquiry, which began in September, is Trump’s July 25 phone call with Kiev. That call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. Trump challenged the accuracy of the complaint, though the transcript released by the White House did support the core allegations that he pressed for politically related investigations.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have claimed shows a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement. Trump denies any wrongdoing.

On the roster: Trump tries shucking Giuliani - Warren reeling - Time out: The Halftime report dressing recipe - Trump’s Florida first strategy - Look out Kermit!



TRUMP TRIES SHUCKING GIULIANI

CBS News: “President Trump tried to distance himself from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts related to Ukraine on Tuesday in an interview with radio host Bill O'Reilly. …O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was, ‘doing in Ukraine on your behalf.’ ‘Well, you have to ask that to Rudy, but Rudy, I don't, I don't even know,’ said Mr. Trump. … Mr. Trump then denied that he had ever directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine on his behalf. However, in May the New York Times reported that Giuliani had planned to go to Ukraine that month, to urge the government there to open several investigations that could aid the president. … The president made it sound as though he did not necessarily have firsthand information about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, that he had ‘heard’ about it or ‘read that someplace.’”



Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before Ukraine aid released - WSJ: “President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kiev before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. … The White House has defended the president’s actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president’s request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.”



Like Clinton, Trump turns to Penn for impeachment advice - WaPo: “As President Trump’s White House battles impeachment, he turned to a familiar face last week: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s top strategists. Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said.”



Voters aren’t budging - Quinnipiac University: “Two weeks of public impeachment hearings in the news haven't hurt President Trump's popularity among American voters. While 40 percent of all registered voters approve of the job President Trump is doing, 54 percent disapprove. … The country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office. While 45 percent of American voters think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 48 percent don't think he should be. … Voter opinion on impeachment will be difficult to move as 86 percent say their mind is made up, while only 13 percent say they might change their mind.”



Dems see next week hearings as last chance to gain public support - Politico: “House Democrats have one final shot to drive up public support for impeachment, with a slate of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee beginning next week. But even Democratic lawmakers acknowledge public sentiment might be impossible to move in the weeks before an anticipated historic House vote on impeaching President Donald Trump. ‘I think people have made up their minds on this in a lot of ways,’ said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ‘But I think, frankly, what should drive us is the evidence and the facts and our oath of office.’ Many Democrats are skeptical that anything they do or say can further tick up backing for impeachment, keenly aware of polling this week showing that support has plateaued in the wake of an explosive set of House Intelligence Committee hearings that unearthed evidence suggesting an abuse of power by Trump.”



WARREN REELING

Quinnipiac University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden has retaken the lead in the Democratic primary race for president as Senator Elizabeth Warren's numbers have plummeted, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Tuesday]. Biden receives 24 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 16 percent, Warren receives 14 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 13 percent. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who just entered the race, receives 3 percent as do Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Sen. Cory Booker, businessman Andrew Yang, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen. Michael Bennet each receive 2 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. Eleven percent are undecided. In an October 24 poll, Warren received 28 percent, Biden had 21 percent, Sanders was at 15 percent, and Buttigieg got 10 percent.”



Buttigieg continues to rise - CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time. Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.”



Sean Trende: What is Bloomy doing? - Politico: “Will this work? Probably not. But Bloomberg can easily drop $500 million on this race and still live out the rest of his years quite comfortably. And there’s a chance that the stars will align and he becomes the next president of the United States. It isn’t a bad bet to make. Regardless, his best shot of making that happen is exactly the shot he is taking: Float above the fray by avoiding the debates and early states, define himself through ad buys elsewhere, and hope for a few lucky breaks in who his Super Tuesday opponents turn out to be.”



Meet the swingiest swing voters - NYT: “Midterm victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin gave Democrats hope of retaking the Rust Belt battleground states that handed the presidency to Donald J. Trump in 2016. Yet success in the midterms might not mean as much for Democratic presidential candidates as the party might think. Nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals, according to recent polling by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College. The results suggest that the party’s winning formula in last year’s midterms may not be so easy to replicate in a presidential election.”



THE RULEBOOK: DO OR DO NOT

“The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 44



TIME OUT: THE HALFTIME REPORT DRESSING RECIPE

The best part about Thanksgiving dinner is the dressing and the best dressing is simple. Sausage, oysters, mushrooms, nuts and berries can only distract from what is a perfectly elegant American bread dish. So here’s how you do it. Cut a loaf of really good, day-old white bread into ½ inch cubes. Bake it in a 225-degree oven for about a 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry and crunchy. Place it in a large mixing bowl. Add ½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, two tablespoons of finely chopped sage and a tables poon of finely (are you sensing a trend?) chopped thyme. Melt 10 tablespoons of the fattiest butter in a big skillet and then sauté until lightly browned 2 cups of small-diced sweet onion and 1½ cups of small-diced celery. Drizzle this deliciousness over your bread and herbs. Toss it well, adding two teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of finely ground pepper as you go. Then gradually add 1½ cups of broth, again tossing lightly. (I prefer to use turkey stock made from gizzards and giblets, but any good poultry stock will do.) Adjust the seasoning. In a small bowl, whisk together two large eggs and another cup of cool or room-temperature stock. Fold that gently but thoroughly into your bread bowl. Place the mixture into a well-buttered 13’x9’ dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for ~40 minutes and save the sausage for breakfast.



[Ed. note: If I think about what I would do for our republic if I had three wishes to employ, one of them surely would be used for a great awakening of local and regional news coverage. Maybe nothing so afflicts us today as a replacement of local concerns with national matters. Our attention rightly belongs where we live, work and love. We should care much more about the nature of our local government than the distant considerations of the federal leviathan. The government in Washington is a large, blunt instrument and national politics reflect those characteristics. Dealing with each other on the local level increases the chances that we will see our fellow citizens as individuals with complicated, varied views rather than faceless partisan enemies. Part of the reason for our retreat into dunderheaded national partisan politics has been the long slow death of local news coverage. The internet tipped over the huge, over-leveraged newspaper industry in a seeming flash, leaving behind a terrible void that national news coverage can never and should never fill. One of my favorite newspaper traditions has been for decades my hometown newspaper, the Wheeling [W. Va.] Intelligencer’s annual republishing of the same perfect Thanksgiving column by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a truly great newsman in his own right, as my mentor when I later learned my way around the press and politics in Charleston, W. Va. 20 years ago or so. We’ve kept that Thanksgiving tradition alive here in this note and encourage you to spend some time with Adam Kelly’s words. But the essence is in this paragraph: “Family and freedom are ordinary words … except for those who cannot now experience those blessings, and so, Lord, this day I give You thanks for the priceless privileges which are mine as an American citizen … The freedom to speak, to write, to think, without government interference or control; the right to worship You in any way I choose.” We need now to raise up and sustain a new army of Adam Kellys in newsrooms across the country, in big cities and little towns, to remind us of our blessings and to focus our attention on what needs to be put right where we live. If you count a free press as one of the blessings worth celebrating this Thanksgiving, make sure you’re backing it up. Support local news outlets with your time and money. We need to know each other better, and that’s a great place to start. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication on Dec. 2. In the meantime, Brianna and I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially those facing adversity.]

TRUMP’S FLORIDA FIRST STRATEGY

WaPo: “President Trump’s raucous Tuesday night rally near Miami, billed by his campaign as a ‘homecoming’ extravaganza, followed his recent decision to move his formal residence from New York to Florida — and underscored the state’s importance to his reelection efforts as he grapples with the impeachment proceedings that threaten his presidency. Florida is now not only Trump’s home but also what Republicans hope is an emerging GOP bastion. His strategy in the state reflects his broader push to galvanize his core voters ahead of next year’s election by unleashing an incendiary defense of his conduct, be it on Twitter, cable news or in front of thousands. By rallying a capacity crowd at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center on Tuesday night, Trump tried to demonstrate broad and determined opposition to his impeachment.”



Set to rake bucks in Britain - Axios: “When President Trump visits London next week for the NATO summit, he'll also use his brief time on the ground there to raise big bucks for his 2020 campaign, according to an invitation reviewed by Axios and conversations with people familiar with the event. Details: The Dec. 3 fundraiser, which hasn't previously been reported, will be hosted by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., national finance chairman Todd Ricketts, and Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the invitation. The Trump team expects to raise $3 million from the event, according to a source familiar with the planning.”

AUDIBLE: THE LEFTOVERS ARE THE BEST

“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – President Abraham Lincoln in the 1863 proclamation establishing the precedent for the Thanksgiving



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.’ Truer words were never written. I suggest one other essential quality, honest self evaluation. For example, suppose a member opposing your side says or does something that rankles you. Ask yourself, if a member of my side said or did the same thing, would I respond the same way? One should also do the same exercise in reverse to evaluate speech and actions by members of one’s own side. I’ll call this the political Golden Rule.” – Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.

CNN: “What should have been a normal day at work took a turn for the surreal for one TV journalist, when he was relentlessly pursued by a pig -- live on air. Lazos Mantikos was in the Greek town of Kineta Tuesday to report on flood damage, but he ended up becoming the story himself when the female pig seemed to take a liking to him. ‘Good morning, we have an issue,’ said Mantikos on the ‘Good Morning Greece’ show from CNN affiliate ANT1. ‘Giorgos, can you hear me? We have a pig here that has been chasing us since this morning ... folks, sorry, I can't stand (still) because it's biting me.’ The segment begins with studio journalist Giorgos Papadakis introducing the reporter.”

The episode is titled “Coup.” Harold Wilson is prime minister of Britain. He has just devalued the British pound and a bad economy has provoked street demonstrators to call for his removal from office.

A cabal ensues, led by Cecil King, the editor of the otherwise pro-Labour Party newspaper, the Daily Mirror. The plotters select Lord Mountbatten as the one they wish to replace Wilson.

LIZ PEEK: REGRETFUL DEMOCRATS LOCKED INTO TRUMP IMPEACHMENT — AND PAYING A PRICE FOR IT

Wilson hears about the coup attempt and calls the Queen before the plotters can get to her. She then invites Mountbatten to Buckingham Palace where she admonishes her second cousin after which the following exchange takes place:

Mountbatten: “Why would you protect a man like Wilson?”

The Queen: “I am protecting the prime minister. I am protecting the Constitution. I am protecting democracy.”

Mountbatten: “But if the man at the heart of that democracy threatens to destroy it, are we supposed to just stand by and do nothing?”

The Queen: Yes. Doing nothing is exactly what we do and bide our time and wait for the people who voted him in to vote him out again if, indeed that is what they decide to do.”

Mountbatten decides not to proceed. Whether this scene is accurate, or not (and much of the series claims fidelity to history), it makes a point Americans should take to heart. President Trump won the 2016 election in spite of many obstacles, including united media opposition, meddling by Russia and corrupt elements in Ukraine, which sought to tilt the U.S. election in favor of Hillary Clinton.

Unlike 1968 when the economy was bad in Britain, the U.S. economy now is booming and consumer confidence is high. The impeachment hearings exposed disagreements over foreign policy, foreign policy the president has a right to make. They revealed a legitimate concern by the president that U.S. aid would go down a corruption rabbit hole, something the Obama administration had also been concerned about because it refused to send lethal aid to Ukraine “fearing that it would only escalate the bloodshed and give President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a pretext for further incursions.”

It appears that Trump also wanted the new leadership in Ukraine to investigate the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter in Ukraine, and whether they had become tainted, something the American media and President Obama’s Justice Department failed to do.

If articles of impeachment are passed by the House, it could take the Senate at least until the beginning of the primary election season in February to hold a trial. The process might drag on even further should Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decide to do so, and Republicans call witnesses of their own, including the Bidens.

While impeachment is a constitutional process, democracy is a greater one. The phrase “We the people” in the Preamble was critical to the founders. It separated America from the notion that the state and its leader, whether kings, queens, or dictators, and testimony from unelected bureaucrats is supreme. It says the people possess ultimate power.

That is why it should be up to voters this close to the next election. Wait for the people who voted Trump in either to reelect him or vote him out. Impeaching him will likely alienate half the country and could damage faith in our electoral process.

395,Howard Kurtz,"Back when he was New York’s mayor, Mike Bloomberg routinely feuded with the press over his whereabouts.

Now,… [+4067 chars]","Back when he was New York’s mayor, Mike Bloomberg routinely feuded with the press over his whereabouts.",2019-11-26,Fox News,"Bloomberg News punts on candidate Bloomberg and Dems, but not Trump",https://www.foxnews.com/media/bloomberg-news-punts-on-candidate-bloomberg-and-dems-but-not-trump,"Back when he was New York’s mayor, Mike Bloomberg routinely feuded with the press over his whereabouts.

He doggedly refused to release his weekend schedule, even if he was traveling out of town, favoring his own privacy over the public’s right to know.

Now, as of Sunday, he’s running for president. But one organization that won’t be covering him aggressively is Bloomberg News.

FORGOTTEN? WHY MSNBC’S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE MADE NO NEWS

This is a journalistic giant, churning out 5,000 stories a day, some of them market-moving. Bloomberg News has 2,700 journalists spread across 150 bureaus around the globe, along with a television network, a magazine and those extremely lucrative Wall Street terminals.

But after the 77-year-old billionaire jumped into the Democratic race, the news service’s editor-in-chief, John Micklethwait, issued an edict to his staff.

“We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation),” the memo said. And that prohibition would extend to his rivals in the party because “We cannot treat Mike’s Democratic competitors differently.”

So everyone from Biden to Bernie to Booker to Bloomberg is off-limits for investigation.

But its team “will continue to investigate the Trump administration as the government of the day.”

If you wanted to come up with a policy that would seem to favor Bloomberg and his re-adopted party—he ran for mayor as a Republican—while disadvantaging the man whose job he wants, it would be hard to beat this.

I get that it’s a messy situation, but this is a compromise that satisfies precisely no one.

If Bloomberg’s family (and presumably Joe Biden’s son) are off-limits, are Donald Trump’s kids still fair game?

Bloomberg News has always been squeamish about covering its founder. A similarly restrictive policy was in place during Mayor Bloomberg’s 12-year tenure. But now he’s running for the highest office in the land. What issue doesn’t in some way touch on the presidential campaign?

When the ex-mayor flirted with a 2016 run, Kathy Kiely resigned as Bloomberg News’ political editor because of the same policy.

“I think that when you're running a political operation as we were that you should follow every story aggressively, and I felt that we weren't able to follow this story aggressively,” Kiely told me on “Media Buzz.” “And that I thought compromised us as an organization. I certainly --- I certainly felt it compromised me as an editor.”

Megan Murphy, Bloomberg’s former Washington bureau chief, tweeted that the policy was “ridiculous” and “not journalism.” She said she threatened to resign over a similar memo during that 2016 exploration.

The Micklethwait memo also addresses Bloomberg Opinion. The two top editors, Tim O’Brien (an MSNBC contributor) and David Shipley, are taking leaves to join the Bloomberg campaign. Meanwhile, the rest of the editorial board is being suspended and the section will refuse to publish any outside op-ed on the 2020 campaign. Closed for business.

The company says it will assign a reporter to follow the Bloomberg campaign, writing about speeches, policies and polls. The initial story on the launch said the candidate is “offering his own mix of moderate policy stances and experience in business, government and philanthropy as the way to beat President Donald Trump.”

The editor-in-chief says he doesn’t want to lay down too many rules so they can adapt to changing circumstances, and will reassess the situation if Bloomberg wins the nomination.

This is a dilemma not seen since William Randolph Hearst blatantly used his newspapers to promote his 1904 presidential bid. But Bloomberg’s company dwarfs that early 20th-century enterprise.

Other media companies examine their owners, or corporate parents, with little fuss. The Washington Post reports on Jeff Bezos and Amazon. ABC sometimes has to cover Disney. CNN had to cover Time Warner and now AT&T. It’s a fact of life in the era of corporate media.

Mike Bloomberg, to his everlasting credit, took a $10-million payout from a Wall Street firm to launch an incredibly successful business news operation. Many talented journalists have worked there over the years. It’s a shame that this short-sighted move could taint its reputation for journalistic independence."

As with so many debates in Washington, it could all come down to the moderates.

A senior administration official claimed Friday, after the apparent conclusion of House Intelligence Committee hearings, that it's ""not clear the House is going to impeach.""

DEM REVERSES COURSE ON IMPEACHMENT AGAIN, NOW SUPPORTS AFTER SAYING IT HAD NO VALUE

This, despite House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., declaring the ""evidence of Trump's misconduct is already overwhelming"" -- and many Democrats playing up testimony that linked top officials to a pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and asserted an Oval Office meeting, and possibly aid, were used as leverage.

Yet as with the Russia investigation, while the hearings have been covered extensively -- featuring analysis replete with phrases such as “game over” and “the walls are closing in” -- the polling suggests the needle isn’t moving much in the court of public opinion.

Among critical independents, there are troubling signs for impeachment backers. Fifty percent of independents questioned in an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted Nov. 11-15 did not support impeaching and removing Trump from office, with just 42 percent backing such a move. That’s a slight dip in support compared with the previous NPR/PBS/Marist poll – conducted the first week in October – when support stood at 45 percent.

While that poll was conducted before last week’s high-profile testimony, it raises the possibility that the hearings in Washington are not resonating so much outside the Beltway.

Under pressure from aggressive GOP ads, it remains unclear whether vulnerable Democrats in districts Trump won would have the stomach to go through with impeachment in the end even if the party appears united against Trump now. Just two Democrats voted against the resolution establishing the inquiry last month: Reps. Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey. But voting to start the process and voting to impeach the president are different political equations.

A window into the pressure campaign to keep Democrats in line came over a 48-hour period this week when Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., changed her tune twice on impeachment.

On Sunday, Lawrence said she no longer saw any value in the process and called on Democrats to back a symbolic censure resolution instead.

""We are so close to an election,"" Lawrence said Sunday on a Michigan radio program, noting that Trump stands little chance of being convicted by the GOP-controlled Senate. ""I will tell you, sitting here knowing how divided this country is, I don't see the value of taking him out of office. But I do see the value of putting down a marker saying his behavior is not acceptable.""

While Lawrence presented a censure as a “marker,” it would also mark a climbdown for Democrats, whose impeachment push has sidelined almost every other political issue since the summer.

AS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BREAKS FOR THANKSGIVING, CONVERSATIONS OVER TURKEY COULD DICTATE NEXT STEPS

But on Tuesday Lawrence issued a new statement, saying she continues to support impeachment.

""I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,"" Lawrence said in a statement. ""The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment.""

Asked by Fox News whether Democratic leadership pushed for the latest statement, an aide said: ""Not that I know of."" But the aide suggested the congresswoman still likes the idea of a censure, saying, ""What she was trying to say is that because she doesn't think the Senate will convict, that maybe censure would be a viable option.""

The Republican National Committee promptly sent out an email blast crowing that Democrats are getting ""cold feet"" and ""vulnerable"" members ""should listen to their constituents and be the next group to abandon ship.""

Other Democrats have expressed some uncertainty without tipping their hands. Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., told The Washington Examiner that she doesn’t know if the impeachment hearings will change voters' minds.

“I’ll have to see,” she said. “Whether it will shift their minds one way or the other, I don’t know that.”

The next few weeks are key.

Lawmakers are likely to keep a close eye on how public opinion shifts or doesn’t over the Thanksgiving break. Democrats in pro-Trump districts could face difficult decisions -- and while the math is in the pro-impeachment favor, it isn’t a slam dunk.

A simple majority -- 216 of 431 members -- is needed to impeach. There are 233 Democrats, meaning that presuming anti-Trump independent Rep. Justin Amash backs impeachment, Democrats can lose 18 of their own and still impeach the president.

Thirty-one of those Democrats represent districts carried by Trump in 2016. Those members will be watched closely as the House Judiciary Committee takes up the case and considers articles of impeachment as soon as next month.

As for Republicans, it seems extremely unlikely that any will break off. Republicans such as Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, who was eyed as a possible break-off from the GOP, recently indicated he will vote against impeachment.

Democrats also face the prospect of a Republican-controlled Senate trial, in which Republicans could use the proceedings to go on offense and call their own witnesses to make their case that there was Ukrainian interference in 2016, or that former Vice President Joe Biden or his son's conduct in the country was inappropriate.

Sensing a possible opening, the Republican National Committee is ramping up the pressure on Democrats in pro-Trump districts. As reported by The Daily Caller, the RNC is running ads urging voters to pick a lawmaker who “won’t waste taxpayer $$$ on partisan impeachment.”

“[House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi herself said impeachment must be ‘compelling,’ ‘overwhelming,’ and ‘bipartisan,’"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted.

“After 2 weeks of sham hearings, the Democrats’ case against @realDonaldTrump is dead — and the only thing that’s 'bipartisan' is the opposition to their entire charade,” she said.

* The right expected way too much from the Horowitz report: “The Justice Department’s inspector general found no evidence that the F.B.I. attempted to place undercover agents or informants inside Donald J. Trump’s campaign in 2016 as agents investigated whether his associates conspired with Russia’s election interference operation, people familiar with a draft of the inspector general’s report said.”

* Dems seem to be raising a legitimate point: “As the Justice Department’s internal watchdog prepares to release a long-awaited report examining the FBI’s conduct in 2016 and 2017 in the Russia investigation, Democrats are expressing frustration over what they view as his failure to examine the conduct of Donald Trump’s attorneys general over the past two years.”

* Climate crisis: “With world leaders gathering in Madrid next week for their annual bargaining session over how to avert a climate catastrophe, the latest assessment issued by the United Nations said Tuesday that greenhouse gas emissions are still rising dangerously.”

* Remember last week, when Trump’s EPA started rolling back chemical-plant safeguards? “An explosion at a chemical plant in southeastern Texas early on Wednesday injured at least eight people, shattered the windows of nearby homes and forced residents near the site to flee as orange flames shot into the sky.”

* Perhaps we should encourage more immigration while creating a support infrastructure for families, including child care: “A final tally of babies born in the U.S. last year confirms that the birth rate fell again in 2018, reaching the lowest level in more than three decades.”

Indeed, Mueller would never have concluded his $35 million, 22-month investigation had he not enjoyed cooperation from the White House.

White House employees were questioned freely by the special counsel. Documents were released. When the special counsel’s exhaustive investigation into purported Trump-Russia collusion found no such crime, the fallback claim of obstruction arose. Trump allegedly wanted to curtail Mueller’s parameters of inquiry into something that was proven not to be a crime.

Mueller found no grounds for a criminal referral on obstruction of justice. But he repeatedly hinted that Trump had thought about obstructing the non-crime of collusion.

In the Ukrainian melodrama, Trump is accused of the thought crime of considering the withholding of military assistance unless Ukraine investigated possible Ukrainian tampering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and also former Vice President Joe Biden’s intervention in Ukrainian politics on behalf of his son.

Biden had bragged at a Council on Foreign Relations conference that his threats to withhold non-military assistance to Ukraine led to the dismissal of a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. It turns out Shokin may have been considering an investigation of the energy company where Biden’s son Hunter had been given a lucrative position on the board of directors.

Two questions arise from hours of impeachment inquiry testimony before the House Intelligence Committee:

One, did Trump cut off military assistance, prompting the compliant Ukrainians to launch investigations to ensure that endangered military aid was not curtailed?

Two, did Trump reverse prior U.S. foreign policy by cutting off military assistance, thus threatening the security of Ukraine?

Regarding question No. 1, military assistance was delivered to Ukraine after a delay. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky never announced investigations of the Bidens or election tampering.

In response to question No. 2, the Obama administration’s policy was to deny significant military assistance to Ukraine. Even non-military aid was apparently leveraged by Biden to force the Ukrainians to fire a prosecutor whose role in looking into Hunter Biden’s company is still murky.

In other words, Trump is accused of thinking about cutting off aid as a lever to force Ukrainian investigations. Yet the prior administration never extended significant military aid and threatened to cancel non-military aid over a bothersome prosecutor.

That disconnect prompts another question: Is thinking about cutting off military aid to Ukraine a greater crime than declining to provide Ukraine with significant military aid?

Trump is also accused of the thought crime of contemplating bribery. Critics allege that Trump wanted Ukraine to do him a “favor” of inestimable value by launching those investigations.

Trump supposedly used the gifting power of the U.S. government to obtain a personal political benefit to his 2020 presidential candidacy.

But that premise is shaky on a number of grounds. Trump did not receive any such investigatory help from Ukraine. Yet even if Ukraine had announced the investigations that Trump had sought, the fact that Joe Biden chose to run for president in 2020 does not exempt him from government scrutiny of his suspect behavior with regard to Ukraine when he was vice president.

Both Democrats and Republicans seem to agree that corruption is endemic in Ukraine and demands constant vigilance as a condition for foreign aid. Moreover, the public did not learn about the bad optics of the Bidens in Ukraine from Trump-pressured Ukrainian leaks. Instead, Biden publicly bragged of his own clout in strong-arming the Ukrainians — and ostensibly about how tough he would be as a future president. Any benefit to Trump of showcasing Biden’s bad behavior came not from thinking about pressuring Ukraine, but from Biden’s own braggadocio.

Joe Biden, not Donald Trump, smeared Joe Biden’s reputation.

Trump has been accused of thought crimes, not actual crimes. Trump can be indiscreet, even crude, in his speech. But alleged bad thoughts are not crimes — at least not outside George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984.”

First, there was the persistent criticism of Biden's campaign from Obama's inner circle. Then, there were the lingering questions over why ""44"" has not simply endorsed his former vice president. Now come reports that Obama has made discouraging -- even derisive -- comments about his candidacy.

BIDEN CLINGS TO OBAMA LEGACY AS CANDIDACY STUMBLES -- THOUGH EX-PRESIDENT, AIDES KEEP DISTANCE

""[Y]ou know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden,"" Obama said about a connection with voters, according to a recent Politico Magazine report. That remark reportedly was made to one of Biden's Democratic primary opponents.

An August New York Times report also cited a source who claimed that before Biden officially entered the 2020 race, Obama told him, “You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t.”

That article came after Obama's former top strategist David Axelrod had harsh words for the former vice president. Axelrod warned that Biden “has sort of played into the caricature” of being mentally weak that President Trump has played on in the past. This, after Axelrod had questioned Biden's ""steadiness"" regarding an abortion policy flip-flop.

Axelrod also has described Biden as “confused” and suggested he looked like “part of the past rather than the future,” after a heated exchange during a June debate between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The dismissive commentary from one of the chief architects of Obama's history-making 2008 presidential run is not helpful for a candidate who has latched his campaign to the Obama legacy -- routinely defending ObamaCare in the face of primary rivals vowing to pursue ""Medicare-for-all,"" and reminding voters of their bond. (In the category of kidding/not kidding, Biden once posted matching friendship bracelets on Twitter wishing the former commander-in-chief a happy Best Friends Day. Obama responded with a classy, ""Back atcha Joe,"" along with a GIF of him calling Biden the ""best VP America has ever had."")

Obama may think Biden was a great VP -- but that doesn't mean he sees him as president.

Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and current Fox News contributor, pointed to signals from Obama's aides.

“The Obama team is everywhere across the field and you don’t get the sense that there’s a lot of love and enthusiasm for Joe Biden as a candidate,” Rove said Tuesday. “Maybe it’s because they don’t think he can get it across the line, maybe it’s because they don’t agree with him, or maybe it’s because they dealt with him in the Obama administration and while they have a great deal of affection for him don’t think he has what it takes to be a presidential candidate and a victor.”

Obama has yet to endorse any candidate in the race, but Biden has said that it was his decision not to seek an endorsement from the former president.

At the same time, the mixed messages from Obama World do not seem to be hurting Biden at the moment.

A new CNN poll released Wednesday has Biden leading the pack with 28 percent, well ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with 17 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with 14 percent, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 11 percent.

And a newly released Quinnipiac University poll of Democratic-leaning voters had Biden in first place with 24 percent, and way ahead of the other candidates on the question of who would have the best chance of defeating Trump."

""I understood what he was trying to do. I didn't really appreciate it,"" Thomas said of Biden, the former chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Biden, who oversaw Thomas' confirmation hearings in 1991, had tried to ask Thomas about ""natural law"" -- a thinly veiled attempt to get at his views on abortion, according to the justice.

""Natural law was nothing more than a way of tricking me into talking about abortion,"" Thomas said, according to ABC News.

His comments came as part of the documentary ""Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words."" The film is set to be released in early 2020, nearly 30 years after he assumed his spot on the nation's highest court.

""One of the things you do in hearings is you have to sit there and look attentively at people you know have no idea what they’re talking about,” he said, referring to Biden's questioning.

He also addressed professor Anita Hill's accusations of sexual misconduct. ""Do I have like stupid written on the back of my shirt? I mean come on. We know what this is all about,"" he said.

""People should just tell the truth: 'This is the wrong black guy; he has to be destroyed.' Just say it. Then now we're at least honest with each other.""

He added that the goal of his opposition was to ""get rid"" of him and then ""undermine"" him.

Thomas, the second African American to serve on the court, also spoke about the treatment he and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson experienced as black conservatives.

Thomas famously described his confirmation process as a ""high-tech lynching,"" telling the Judiciary Committee they were participating in a ""circus.""

""As a black American, as far as I'm concerned, it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves ... and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you -- you will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree,"" he said."

""And I think if those numbers stay, hold where they are, even as a baseline, it's not just game over but it is a landslide victory for this president,"" Sanders added.

The former White House official also said Democrats are desperate to find a formidable candidate, responding to a question about former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick who also jumped into the Democrats field.

""I think they're desperately trying to find somebody who can actually run a real campaign,"" Sanders said. ""So far everything we've seen out of the Democrat field does nothing but make every Republican in this country extremely happy because it's clear that Donald Trump is going to win reelection.""

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Earlier this month, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading the field in Iowa with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Elizabeth Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

The former White House press secretary said it's ""pretty clear that Biden doesn't have what it takes in Iowa,"" adding that the Democratic Party is divided into factions.

""They can't pull the coalition together from older people to younger people to African-Americans and Hispanics, white liberals, academics, climate change people,"" Perino said. ""They have all these different factions. And that's because they have created them""

He also weighed in on former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg entering the 2020 race for the White House and claimed he would have to spend somewhere between $5 to $6 six billion to stay competitive with Trump.

""I think Bloomberg ought to be smarter than to do this,"" Gingrich said. ""The truth is in the end unless he's prepared to spend $4 or $5 or $6 billion ... he's not going to be a serious candidate.

If Bloomberg's willing to go in that heavy, I think he could become a serious candidate. But I don’t think he will.

""What he may do is he may contribute to getting to a brokered convention, although I have to say, as much as I thought [Joe] Biden would fade, he does just keep plugging away, and... you'd have to say the party is moving away from the left, moving back towards Buttigieg, who's sort of a moderate,"" he added.

The tweet, which didn't include any context, came after polling showed voters souring on impeachment and as House Democrats prepare another round of hearings in the ongoing impeachment inquiry. On Tuesday, Trump denounced Democrats' inquiry to a packed rally in Florida.

“First it was the Russia hoax,” Trump said. “And now the same maniacs are pushing the deranged ... impeachment” narrative.

For the past few months, Trump has been fending off accusations that he sought to influence the 2020 election by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

The president and Republicans have denied any wrongdoing and repeatedly portrayed Trump as the victim of a partisan attempt to overturn the 2016 election.

TRUMP TEARS INTO IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, DEFENDS MILITARY PARDONS AT FLORIDA 'HOMECOMING RALLY'

""It is a Democrat Scam that is going nowhere but, future Presidents should in no way be compromised. What has happened to me should never happen to another President!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday.

Trump also tweeted a clip of Fox News host Pete Hegseth reporting on the massive crowd size of Tuesday night's rally in Florida. During interviews with Hegseth, rally attendees expressed their support for the president.

""I come from a family of Democrats and I just can't take the swamp anymore,"" one attendee said. Another said that he grew up as a Democrat but became a ""staunch supporter of Trump.""

HOUSE DEMOCRATS DEFEND IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

On Twitter, Trump faced a wave of mockery for posting a photo of his face on Rocky's body. Some knocked his physical appearance, suggesting that he was nowhere near the shape that Rocky was. It also comes as Trump is dismissing rumors he had a health scare after a recent visit to Walter Reed Medical Center.

The photo also seemed to indicate Trump's mood going into the second round of impeachment hearings, led by the House Judiciary Committee.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the committee's chair, sent a letter to Trump, apparently welcoming a challenge for the first hearing, which is scheduled for Dec. 4.

That's different. We're not interested in prolonging the debate, only in ending it with a quick knock-out.

So, let's start with economic inequality. Did you know 70 percent of rich Americans grew up in lower-income households? Yep, they moved up.

Wealth not only leaves the wealthy after generations. It shifts to the poor.

I mean, how else could Sanders afford so many homes? He moved up the ladder he claims didn’t exist. When the only thing he could run is a stocking.

You want to talk impeachment? Fine. Good luck impeaching President Trump for doing his job, which is uncovering corruption. If satisfying the public interest helps his interests, so what?

And quid pro quo? That’s life. It'd be great to get something for nothing, but that involves killing. Bartering beats bombing.

Unless it's the Islamic State. The orange man finished them off. And let the dog have the last laugh.

But I'll listen to Bill Gates, who says nuclear is a vital energy source, especially if you want to cut carbon emissions.

Trump? Yeah, he's bad: we have the lowest unemployment in decades for blacks, women, Hispanics are doing better under Trump than Obama. And bodies aren't coming home in coffins.

What's your alternative?

On the roster: Trump tries shucking Giuliani - Warren reeling - Time out: The Halftime report dressing recipe - Trump’s Florida first strategy - Look out Kermit!



TRUMP TRIES SHUCKING GIULIANI

CBS News: “President Trump tried to distance himself from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts related to Ukraine on Tuesday in an interview with radio host Bill O'Reilly. …O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was, ‘doing in Ukraine on your behalf.’ ‘Well, you have to ask that to Rudy, but Rudy, I don't, I don't even know,’ said Mr. Trump. … Mr. Trump then denied that he had ever directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine on his behalf. However, in May the New York Times reported that Giuliani had planned to go to Ukraine that month, to urge the government there to open several investigations that could aid the president. … The president made it sound as though he did not necessarily have firsthand information about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, that he had ‘heard’ about it or ‘read that someplace.’”



Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before Ukraine aid released - WSJ: “President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kiev before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. … The White House has defended the president’s actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president’s request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.”



Like Clinton, Trump turns to Penn for impeachment advice - WaPo: “As President Trump’s White House battles impeachment, he turned to a familiar face last week: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s top strategists. Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said.”



Voters aren’t budging - Quinnipiac University: “Two weeks of public impeachment hearings in the news haven't hurt President Trump's popularity among American voters. While 40 percent of all registered voters approve of the job President Trump is doing, 54 percent disapprove. … The country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office. While 45 percent of American voters think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 48 percent don't think he should be. … Voter opinion on impeachment will be difficult to move as 86 percent say their mind is made up, while only 13 percent say they might change their mind.”



Dems see next week hearings as last chance to gain public support - Politico: “House Democrats have one final shot to drive up public support for impeachment, with a slate of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee beginning next week. But even Democratic lawmakers acknowledge public sentiment might be impossible to move in the weeks before an anticipated historic House vote on impeaching President Donald Trump. ‘I think people have made up their minds on this in a lot of ways,’ said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ‘But I think, frankly, what should drive us is the evidence and the facts and our oath of office.’ Many Democrats are skeptical that anything they do or say can further tick up backing for impeachment, keenly aware of polling this week showing that support has plateaued in the wake of an explosive set of House Intelligence Committee hearings that unearthed evidence suggesting an abuse of power by Trump.”



WARREN REELING

Quinnipiac University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden has retaken the lead in the Democratic primary race for president as Senator Elizabeth Warren's numbers have plummeted, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Tuesday]. Biden receives 24 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 16 percent, Warren receives 14 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 13 percent. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who just entered the race, receives 3 percent as do Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Sen. Cory Booker, businessman Andrew Yang, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen. Michael Bennet each receive 2 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. Eleven percent are undecided. In an October 24 poll, Warren received 28 percent, Biden had 21 percent, Sanders was at 15 percent, and Buttigieg got 10 percent.”



Buttigieg continues to rise - CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time. Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.”



Sean Trende: What is Bloomy doing? - Politico: “Will this work? Probably not. But Bloomberg can easily drop $500 million on this race and still live out the rest of his years quite comfortably. And there’s a chance that the stars will align and he becomes the next president of the United States. It isn’t a bad bet to make. Regardless, his best shot of making that happen is exactly the shot he is taking: Float above the fray by avoiding the debates and early states, define himself through ad buys elsewhere, and hope for a few lucky breaks in who his Super Tuesday opponents turn out to be.”



Meet the swingiest swing voters - NYT: “Midterm victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin gave Democrats hope of retaking the Rust Belt battleground states that handed the presidency to Donald J. Trump in 2016. Yet success in the midterms might not mean as much for Democratic presidential candidates as the party might think. Nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals, according to recent polling by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College. The results suggest that the party’s winning formula in last year’s midterms may not be so easy to replicate in a presidential election.”



THE RULEBOOK: DO OR DO NOT

“The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 44



TIME OUT: THE HALFTIME REPORT DRESSING RECIPE

The best part about Thanksgiving dinner is the dressing and the best dressing is simple. Sausage, oysters, mushrooms, nuts and berries can only distract from what is a perfectly elegant American bread dish. So here’s how you do it. Cut a loaf of really good, day-old white bread into ½ inch cubes. Bake it in a 225-degree oven for about a 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry and crunchy. Place it in a large mixing bowl. Add ½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, two tablespoons of finely chopped sage and a tables poon of finely (are you sensing a trend?) chopped thyme. Melt 10 tablespoons of the fattiest butter in a big skillet and then sauté until lightly browned 2 cups of small-diced sweet onion and 1½ cups of small-diced celery. Drizzle this deliciousness over your bread and herbs. Toss it well, adding two teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of finely ground pepper as you go. Then gradually add 1½ cups of broth, again tossing lightly. (I prefer to use turkey stock made from gizzards and giblets, but any good poultry stock will do.) Adjust the seasoning. In a small bowl, whisk together two large eggs and another cup of cool or room-temperature stock. Fold that gently but thoroughly into your bread bowl. Place the mixture into a well-buttered 13’x9’ dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for ~40 minutes and save the sausage for breakfast.



[Ed. note: If I think about what I would do for our republic if I had three wishes to employ, one of them surely would be used for a great awakening of local and regional news coverage. Maybe nothing so afflicts us today as a replacement of local concerns with national matters. Our attention rightly belongs where we live, work and love. We should care much more about the nature of our local government than the distant considerations of the federal leviathan. The government in Washington is a large, blunt instrument and national politics reflect those characteristics. Dealing with each other on the local level increases the chances that we will see our fellow citizens as individuals with complicated, varied views rather than faceless partisan enemies. Part of the reason for our retreat into dunderheaded national partisan politics has been the long slow death of local news coverage. The internet tipped over the huge, over-leveraged newspaper industry in a seeming flash, leaving behind a terrible void that national news coverage can never and should never fill. One of my favorite newspaper traditions has been for decades my hometown newspaper, the Wheeling [W. Va.] Intelligencer’s annual republishing of the same perfect Thanksgiving column by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a truly great newsman in his own right, as my mentor when I later learned my way around the press and politics in Charleston, W. Va. 20 years ago or so. We’ve kept that Thanksgiving tradition alive here in this note and encourage you to spend some time with Adam Kelly’s words. But the essence is in this paragraph: “Family and freedom are ordinary words … except for those who cannot now experience those blessings, and so, Lord, this day I give You thanks for the priceless privileges which are mine as an American citizen … The freedom to speak, to write, to think, without government interference or control; the right to worship You in any way I choose.” We need now to raise up and sustain a new army of Adam Kellys in newsrooms across the country, in big cities and little towns, to remind us of our blessings and to focus our attention on what needs to be put right where we live. If you count a free press as one of the blessings worth celebrating this Thanksgiving, make sure you’re backing it up. Support local news outlets with your time and money. We need to know each other better, and that’s a great place to start. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication on Dec. 2. In the meantime, Brianna and I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially those facing adversity.]

TRUMP’S FLORIDA FIRST STRATEGY

WaPo: “President Trump’s raucous Tuesday night rally near Miami, billed by his campaign as a ‘homecoming’ extravaganza, followed his recent decision to move his formal residence from New York to Florida — and underscored the state’s importance to his reelection efforts as he grapples with the impeachment proceedings that threaten his presidency. Florida is now not only Trump’s home but also what Republicans hope is an emerging GOP bastion. His strategy in the state reflects his broader push to galvanize his core voters ahead of next year’s election by unleashing an incendiary defense of his conduct, be it on Twitter, cable news or in front of thousands. By rallying a capacity crowd at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center on Tuesday night, Trump tried to demonstrate broad and determined opposition to his impeachment.”



Set to rake bucks in Britain - Axios: “When President Trump visits London next week for the NATO summit, he'll also use his brief time on the ground there to raise big bucks for his 2020 campaign, according to an invitation reviewed by Axios and conversations with people familiar with the event. Details: The Dec. 3 fundraiser, which hasn't previously been reported, will be hosted by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., national finance chairman Todd Ricketts, and Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the invitation. The Trump team expects to raise $3 million from the event, according to a source familiar with the planning.”

“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – President Abraham Lincoln in the 1863 proclamation establishing the precedent for the Thanksgiving



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.’ Truer words were never written. I suggest one other essential quality, honest self evaluation. For example, suppose a member opposing your side says or does something that rankles you. Ask yourself, if a member of my side said or did the same thing, would I respond the same way? One should also do the same exercise in reverse to evaluate speech and actions by members of one’s own side. I’ll call this the political Golden Rule.” – Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.



[Ed. note: Boy-howdy, Mr. Ciao! Honest self-appraisal – that more-demanding cousin of gratitude – really is the thing. I hereby grant you the rank of brevet colonel in the army of the level-headed, Pacific Command. Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.]

Lazos Mantikos was in the Greek town of Kineta Tuesday to report on flood damage, but he ended up becoming the story himself when the female pig seemed to take a liking to him. ‘Good morning, we have an issue,’ said Mantikos on the ‘Good Morning Greece’ show from CNN affiliate ANT1. ‘Giorgos, can you hear me? We have a pig here that has been chasing us since this morning ... folks, sorry, I can't stand (still) because it's biting me.’ The segment begins with studio journalist Giorgos Papadakis introducing the reporter.”

Trump was said to have advised his lawyers and other subordinates, past and present, not to cooperate fully with the Mueller investigation. Yet the special counsel did not pursue any actionable cases of egregious interference by the White House.

Indeed, Mueller would never have concluded his $35 million, 22-month investigation had he not enjoyed cooperation from the White House.

TUCKER CARLSON: INSTEAD OF DESTROYING TRUMP, IMPEACHMENT APPEARS TO HAVE MADE HIM STRONGER -- LIKE GODZILLA

White House employees were questioned freely by the special counsel. Documents were released. When the special counsel’s exhaustive investigation into purported Trump-Russia collusion found no such crime, the fallback claim of obstruction arose. Trump allegedly wanted to curtail Mueller’s parameters of inquiry into something that was proven not to be a crime.

Mueller found no grounds for a criminal referral on obstruction of justice. But he repeatedly hinted that Trump had thought about obstructing the non-crime of collusion.

In the Ukrainian melodrama, Trump is accused of the thought crime of considering the withholding of military assistance unless Ukraine investigated possible Ukrainian tampering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and also former Vice President Joe Biden’s intervention in Ukrainian politics on behalf of his son.

Biden had bragged at a Council on Foreign Relations conference that his threats to withhold non-military assistance to Ukraine led to the dismissal of a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. It turns out Shokin may have been considering an investigation of the energy company where Biden’s son Hunter had been given a lucrative position on the board of directors.

Two questions arise from hours of impeachment inquiry testimony before the House Intelligence Committee:

One, did Trump cut off military assistance, prompting the compliant Ukrainians to launch investigations to ensure that endangered military aid was not curtailed?

Two, did Trump reverse prior U.S. foreign policy by cutting off military assistance, thus threatening the security of Ukraine?

Regarding question No. 1, military assistance was delivered to Ukraine after a delay. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky never announced investigations of the Bidens or election tampering.

In response to question No. 2, the Obama administration’s policy was to deny significant military assistance to Ukraine. Even non-military aid was apparently leveraged by Biden to force the Ukrainians to fire a prosecutor whose role in looking into Hunter Biden’s company is still murky.

In other words, Trump is accused of thinking about cutting off aid as a lever to force Ukrainian investigations. Yet the prior administration never extended significant military aid and threatened to cancel non-military aid over a bothersome prosecutor.

That disconnect prompts another question: Is thinking about cutting off military aid to Ukraine a greater crime than declining to provide Ukraine with significant military aid?

Trump is also accused of the thought crime of contemplating bribery. Critics allege that Trump wanted Ukraine to do him a “favor” of inestimable value by launching those investigations.

Trump supposedly used the gifting power of the U.S. government to obtain a personal political benefit to his 2020 presidential candidacy.

But that premise is shaky on a number of grounds. Trump did not receive any such investigatory help from Ukraine. Yet even if Ukraine had announced the investigations that Trump had sought, the fact that Joe Biden chose to run for president in 2020 does not exempt him from government scrutiny of his suspect behavior with regard to Ukraine when he was vice president.

Both Democrats and Republicans seem to agree that corruption is endemic in Ukraine and demands constant vigilance as a condition for foreign aid. Moreover, the public did not learn about the bad optics of the Bidens in Ukraine from Trump-pressured Ukrainian leaks. Instead, Biden publicly bragged of his own clout in strong-arming the Ukrainians — and ostensibly about how tough he would be as a future president. Any benefit to Trump of showcasing Biden’s bad behavior came not from thinking about pressuring Ukraine, but from Biden’s own braggadocio.

Joe Biden, not Donald Trump, smeared Joe Biden’s reputation.

Trump has been accused of thought crimes, not actual crimes. Trump can be indiscreet, even crude, in his speech. But alleged bad thoughts are not crimes — at least not outside George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son filed the motion in Arkansas on Wednesday as part of an ongoing child support suit, according to the Daily Mail. His attorneys claim the details would be used by the media, considering his high public profile, to cause him ""undue prejudice, annoyance, embarrassment, and/or oppression.""

COURT FILING ALLEGES THAT DNA TEST SHOWS HUNTER BIDEN FATHERED ARKANSAS WOMAN'S BABY

""The likelihood that [Biden's] private records will be used in an inappropriate or malicious manner for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with these proceedings is exceedingly high and should not be tolerated by the court,"" the filing reads.

""Due to the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the parties involved in this matter, it is in the interest of justice and necessary for a Protective Order to be in place,"" Biden's attorney says.

An earlier court filing in the case alleged that DNA tests confirm with “scientific certainty” that Hunter is the biological father of a child whose mother he denied having sex with.

A paternity suit filed by Lunden Alexis Roberts was first filed on May 28 when she alleged that she and Hunter Biden “were in a relationship” and that “Baby Doe” was born in August 2018 “as a result of that relationship,” according to reports by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

Roberts is demanding $11,000 in legal fees as well as child support, and has agreed that a protective order is appropriate, according to the Daily Mail.

The suit comes amid increased scrutiny on Hunter over his links to a Ukrainian energy company where he once sat on the board.

An apparent effort by White House officials and President Trump to get Ukraine to launch investigations into Hunter’s link to the company -- and Biden Sr.’s push in 2016 to get a prosecutor fired who had investigated the company -- is the current focus of an impeachment inquiry in the House.

“This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly,” Kelly Mehlenbacher, then the state operations director for Harris’ campaign, said in the letter obtained by The New York Times. “While I still believe that Senator Harris is the strongest candidate to win in the General Election in 2020, I no longer have confidence in our campaign or its leadership.”

“It is not acceptable to me that we encouraged people to move from Washington, DC to Baltimore only to lay them off with no notice, with no plan for the campaign, and without thoughtful consideration of the personal consequences to them or the consequences that their absence would have on the remaining staff,” the letter says.

Mehlenbacher has since joined former New York City Michael Bloomberg's campaign, joining as deputy chief operating officer. She had previously worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.

The letter forms part of an in-depth report, featuring interviews with dozens of current and former aides, by the Times. The article marks how Harris, once surging at the top of the polls, has since plummeted amid a reportedly dysfunctional and often headless campaign.

BLOOMBERG PILFERS TOP HARRIS CAMPAIGN AIDE

The article points to a campaign that has not been able to afford TV advertising and has struggled to handle attacks from other Democrats, such as Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News, but campaign manager Juan Rodriguez issued a statement to the Times.

""Our team, from the candidate to organizers across the country, are working day in and out to make sure Kamala is the nominee to take on Donald Trump and end the national nightmare that is his presidency,” he said. “Just like every campaign, we have made tough decisions to have the resources we need to place in Iowa and springboard into the rest of the primary calendar.”

According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls for the nomination, Harris was in second place in early July, commanding an average of 15 percent of primary voters. But since then, she has declined quickly.

Now, RCP polls have her with an average of just under 4 percent — far behind candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden (27 percent), Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. (18.3 percent), Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (15.8 percent), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (11 percent)."
